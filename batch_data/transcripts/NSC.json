Welcome to the Norfolk Southern First Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Michael Hostutler, Norfolk Southern Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Hostutler. You may begin. Michael Hostutler : Thank you, Rob, and good morning. Before we begin today\u2019s call, I would like to mention a few items. First, the slides of the presenters are available on our website in the Investors section. Additionally, transcripts and downloads of today\u2019s call will be posted on our website. Please be advised that any forward-looking statements made during the course of the call represent our best, good faith judgment as to what may occur in the future. Statements that are forward-looking can be identified by the use of words such as believe, expect, anticipate and project. Our actual results may differ materially from those projected and will be subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which may be outside of our control. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for discussions of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. Additionally, keep in mind that all references to reported results, excluding certain adjustments, that is, non-GAAP numbers, have been reconciled on our website in the Investors section. Now, it is my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern Chairman and CEO, Wick Moorman. Wick Moorman : Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. It\u2019s my pleasure to welcome you to our first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. With me today are several members of our senior team, including our President, Jim Squires; our Chief Marketing Officer, Don Seale; our Chief Operating Officer, Mark Manion; and our Chief Financial Officer, Marta Stewart. Norfolk Southern\u2019s earnings for the quarter were $1.17 per share compared with $1.41 last year, which as you will recall included a land sale that added $0.19 per share. Of course, our results during the quarter were impacted by the severe winter weather, which adversely affected both revenues and expenses. This year\u2019s results also included a deferred tax benefit related to a state tax reduction. Don and Marta will provide additional details in their remarks. Looking at our top line, revenues for the quarter were $2.7 billion, a decrease of $49 million or 2%. Overall, volumes fell 1% as declines in merchandise more than offset the growth in the intermodal units. Expenses were down 1% despite the added costs from the winter weather. On the service side, we also saw the effects of the adverse weather as our favorable trends from last year were temporarily reversed in the first quarter. While our velocity and terminal dwell metrics deteriorated in the first quarter, we have seen them improve in the recent weeks and expect these trends will continue as we enter into spring and warmer weather. Mark will provide the details of the first quarter operating results. At this point, I will turn the program over to Don and the rest of the team and I will return with some closing remarks before we take your questions. Don? Don Seale : Thanks, Wick and good morning, everyone. First quarter revenue of $2.7 billion was down $49 million or 2% compared to first quarter of last year, as the $94 million decline in our coal market more than offset revenue gains achieved in intermodal and merchandise. Negative mix and price accounted for $38 million of the overall revenue decline for the quarter and lower volume due primarily to severe winter weather conditions generated a negative $32 million in revenue variance. On the plus side, higher fuel surcharge contributed a positive $21 million in revenue year-over-year. Turning to revenue per unit, merchandise RPU showed the greatest increase due to continued growth in chemicals, increased fuel surcharge revenue and pricing gains. Intermodal RPU showed a marginal increase of 1%, despite a slight decline in fuel surcharge per unit. As a reminder, intermodal fuel surcharges are tied to East Coast highway diesel prices rather than West Texas intermediate crude. Coal continues to be impacted by negative mix effects related to the decline in export coal volume. In total, revenue per unit for the quarter for our book of business was down 1%. With respect to volume, turning to the next slide, total shipments for the quarter were down 1% as intermodal gains were unable to offset declines in Merchandise, and especially in coal. Within all of our markets extreme winter conditions across the network impacted customer production levels, as well as equipment cycle times which suppressed overall first quarter volume. As shown on Slide 5, the impact of severe winter weather was concentrated in January and February, with March showing a fairly strong recovery. Mark will fill you in on the details of the operational challenges faced during the winter, but clearly severe weather in the quarter depressed certain economic activity and shipments in the first two months of the year in particular. Now turning to the individual market segments, coal revenue of $541 million was down $94 million or 15% for the quarter. Within the utilities sector, volume declined by approximately 21,000 loads or 10% while volumes to southern utilities held pace with first quarter 2013 volumes. Volumes to northern utilities declined by 17%, primarily as a result of a contract loss. Export volumes impacted by a continued weak pricing environment were down 23% for the quarter due to reduced metallurgical coal shipments both through Baltimore and Lambert\u2019s Point. Domestic metallurgical volumes were down 16% as a result of reduced customer demand related to plant shutdowns or production curtailments. And on a positive note, industrial coal volumes were up 9% as a result of new business gain. Now turning next to our intermodal network, revenue in intermodal in the quarter reached to $596 million, up $23 million or 4% over first quarter of last year, driven by a 3% higher volume. Domestic volume was up 4% due to continued highway conversions and customer specific growth, while organic growth across our international accounts increased by 1%. As weather and network operations improved in the quarter, we had two record breaking weeks for intermodal shipments in the month of March. Now turning to our Merchandise markets, on Slide 8, Merchandise revenue was up 1% reaching $1.6 billion for the quarter. This increase came as a result of higher revenue per unit for the quarter which was up 3%. Iron, steel, and scrap metal shipments were impacted by sourcing changes and a weaker overall market for scrap metal. Declines were partially all set by gains in track sand and cement shipments leading to an overall 3% decline in metals and construction volume in the quarter. In our agricultural markets, strength in our corn and wheat markets was unable to offset declines in fertilizer volumes compared to strong 2013 level comps and ships and sourcing patterns reduced volumes of feed products due to the return of normalized soybean availability in the new crop. On the plus side, chemicals volume was up 10% due primarily to growth in crude by rail which accounted for over 20,000 shipments in the quarter as well as gains in liquefied petroleum gas volumes. Automotive volumes were down 6% as weather related issues across the U.S. rail network impacted empty multi-level equipment supply and reduced loading capacity. And paper and forest products volumes were down 5% for the quarter with weaker volumes of graphic paper and waste shipments. Now let\u2019s conclude with our outlook for 2014. We see ongoing growth opportunities in our Intermodal and Merchandise markets, while the coal market continues to present both challenges and opportunities. On the plus side for coal, extreme winter weather patterns improved the demand for utility coal with stockpile days at Norfolk Southern served plants falling an estimated 34% from December. Additionally, natural gas prices are projected to be higher in 2014 creating orders from utility for additional spot coal volumes. We now expect our utility business to be flat with 2013 in spite of the year-over-year loss of about 4 million ton contract loss in our northern utility network. In the export market we continued to see depressed export coal volumes and pricing due to lower commodity pricing and increased foreign competition. And in our domestic metallurgical markets we expect reduced volumes as a result of plant closures and sourcing shifts. Turning to our Intermodal markets, our outlook remains bright there as we continue to add attractive freight to our new corridors and terminals. The South Carolina Inland Port opened in the fourth quarter of 2013 and our new Charlotte terminal officially opened in December 2013. Highway conversions and growth with our international shipping partners represent ongoing opportunities and we will remain strongly focused on delivering the superior intermodal service and efficiencies across our double stack intermodal network. In our merchandise markets, we anticipate continued strength in crude by rail as well as shale-related liquid petroleum gas shipments. Frac sand and other materials used for natural gas drilling in the Marcellus and Utica shale regions are also expected to increase. Within our metals markets, U.S. steel production is projected to expand by an estimated 5% during 2014 due to increased steel usage in the auto sector and the recovery in construction market. In automotive, automotive production will continue to grow as North American light vehicle production is projected to increase by 3% to over 17 million vehicles in 2014. Also as the national rail network improves velocity in the days ahead, we expect deferred auto volumes to be shipped, which will bolster overall automotive volumes ahead. In our agricultural markets, with the favorable grain crop and stronger ethanol market, we expect ongoing growth in these market segments for the balance of 2014. And finally, within our paper and forest products markets, we continue to be challenged by the contraction of graphic paper consumption, but see favorable conditions for lumber and related wood products with projected improvements in the housing market. In summary, we expect our merchandise and intermodal markets to generate overall revenue growth ahead with a better outlook for utility coal, while export coal continues to present challenges. And as we recover from the abnormally harsh winter, we are focusing on returning service to 2013 levels or better, which our customers expect and deserve. We will also continue to employ market-based pricing that equals or exceeds rail inflation to support significant investments in our infrastructure and service delivery capabilities and we will remain laser focused on developing new markets by working collaboratively with our customers throughout our network. Thanks for your time. And I will now turn it over to Mark, who will provide you the specifics of our first quarter operations. Mark? Mark Manion : Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter operations were a weather impact story. The series of winter storms across our service territory has been well covered by the media. So, there is no need to give you a blow-by-blow timeline here today, but you will see the impact has been felt in safety, service and productivity. Our people however have done an exceptional job keeping our operations going through at all. Many of them worked in extreme conditions and I would like to acknowledge particularly the commitment of our transportation, mechanical and engineering forces and even our operation support staff in Atlanta, who never missed a beat during an ice storm that pretty much shutdown the city. Looking at our safety performance, we saw an increase in the injury ratio from 1.17 for full year of 2013 to 1.37 for the first quarter of 2014. This is tracking the same numbers we experienced in the second half of 2013. Some of the increase is, no doubt, due to the operating conditions over the period and we did see an improvement in March, as weather began to improve. We continue to focus on a transition, behavior-based approach to improve safety and to secure full engagement and commitment from all our employees in reducing injuries. Training for our entire company will be completed by the end of the second quarter. Train incidents were flat at 2.4 incidents per million train miles for both full year 2013 and the first quarter 2014. Crossing accidents increased slightly from 3.6 per million train miles for full year 2013 to 3.9 per million train miles in the first quarter. And again, the increases are related primarily to storm-related occurrences. Training to service performance, after two years of very strong service performance, the recent shocks from severe winter weather and the resulting reduction in network velocity have had a significant impact on service this quarter. The composite service metric, which combines train performance and connection performance, dropped to 73.4% reflecting slower train operations and increased dwell time at terminals in the areas impacted by weather. On the next slide, slower train operations are reflected in train speed, which was 22.3 miles per hour for the first quarter 2014, while higher than in 2010 and \u201811, below the high performance levels in 2012 and \u201813. Velocity drives many of our operating efficiencies and is our key area of focus in our recovery from the impact of weather issues in the first quarter. Looking at terminal dwell, the impact of extreme temperatures and record snowfall took a toll on locomotive availability in the first quarter resulting in a higher bad order rates and a slower overall network velocity. Consequently, terminal dwell in the first quarter increased to 25 hours. Again, much higher than the record performance over the last two years. Moving to the next slide, we have talked before about the relationship between network velocity and operating efficiencies. As you would expect, the weather and the resulting slowdown in our network had a negative impact on many of our key measures of operating efficiency in the first quarter. Volumes were down 1% from the same period last year. Crew starts were down 4% due in part to reduced volumes, but also due to train annulments and combos made due to power availability. T&E overtime increased 9% and recrews increased 5% due to slower over the road operations. Carloads per unit declined 3% due primarily to reduced train length requirements caused by extreme cold temperatures. And diesel gallons per 1,000 gross ton miles increased 4% partly because engines were left running during extremely cold temperatures to avoid freeze damage. With improving weather we are seeing improving trends in some leading measurements and would expect that this will also be reflected in network velocity over the coming weeks. On the next slide, the impact of weather on our locomotive fleet has been particularly difficult, while weather related issues pushed the bad order ratio to higher levels. We started seeing improvements in mid-March with bad order locomotive counts declining, shown here as the blue line. Similarly as the red line indicates, we have seen trains held for power decline. The reduction in the bad order ratio and the increase in power availability will continue to drive reduction in terminal dwell. The next graph depicts the number of road train recrews. With improving train speeds, the number of trains that have to be recrewed has come down substantially in the last few weeks. And looking at train speed, as you can see it\u2019s been improving since mid-February, up about 6% and the improvements should continue. Similarly, dwell is down 14% since mid-February and we expect this metric to continue to improve as well. With the winter finally behind us, we are confident that we will continue to see improvement in all of our operating metrics and we are still confident that we will achieve productivity savings of about $100 million for the full year. Thank you. And now I will turn it over to Marta. Marta Stewart : Thank you, Mark. Let\u2019s take a look at the first quarter numbers. Slide 2 presents our operating results. As Don described, railway operating revenues decreased by $49 million or 2%. Operating expenses decreased slightly by $25 million or 1% in spite of significant additional weather related costs. The resulting first quarter income from railway operations was $667 million, a decline of $24 million or 3%. The operating ratio increased 40 basis points to 75.4. Slide 3 summarizes the major types of weather related costs. As Wick mentioned and as you saw in Mark\u2019s presentation the harsher winter weather this year slowed down the railway. This loss of velocity along with additional direct costs to keep the tracks clear and our equipment running drove expenses higher in the areas of overtime, fuel and material services and rent. We estimate severe weather added approximately $45 million to our first quarter costs, about equally distributed among these three groups. Now let\u2019s go to the details of our operating expenses. The next slide shows the components of the $25 million net decrease in railway operating expenses. As you can see, the overall decline resulted from a reduction in compensation and benefit costs. Slide 5 details the $40 million or 5% decrease in compensation costs. Post retirement medical and pension related expenses declined by $32 million. On our fourth quarter earnings call in January, I mentioned that pension and retiree medical accruals would decline largely due to strong equity returns and a lower discount rate. During the first quarter, we amended our retiree medical plans to provide for fixed contributions to help reimbursement accounts. As a result, since the company contribution is now limited, we expect a further reduction in our accruals. We now project expenses for pension and post-retirement benefits to be about $40 million lower per quarter for the remainder of 2014. Also contributing to the decrease in compensation costs were reduced labor hours, resulting primarily from lower traffic volumes and fewer trainees. Additionally, medical costs for active employees declined due to fewer employees and a lower premium. These three areas of reductions were somewhat offset by increased pay rate and weather-related over time costs. Moving on to purchased services and rents, our cost decreased by a net of $1 million, reflecting a variety of offsetting items. While lower locomotive and freight car lease costs and reduced professional fees benefited expenses, these were largely offset by increased weather-related costs and higher intermodal volume related expenses. Next, depreciation expense increased by $10 million or 4% reflective of our larger capital base. As you can see on the left hand side of the slide, net properties have grown by about $900 million since this time last year. As shown on Slide 8, fuel expense rose by $3 million or 1%. Because of the cold weather, consumption during the quarter increased 3% even though traffic volume was down slightly. Lower prices partly offset this headwind as the 2014 first quarter average diesel fuel price was $3.10 per gallon versus $3.19 in the first quarter of 2013. The materials and other category, showed on the next slide, increased by $3 million or 1%. Once again, the weather affected our costs with a $9 million spike in locomotive and freight car maintenance materials. This rise was somewhat offset by lower environmental related expenses while personal injury costs were even with last year. Turning to our non-operating items, other income net was down $109 million, or 81% due principally to the absence of the $97 million land sale gain, which benefited the first quarter of 2013. Lower coal royalty and lower return to our corporate and life insurance also contributed to the decrease. Interest expense on debt was up $10 million related to the debt we issued last year. Next, income tax has totaled $186 million and the effective tax rate was 33.6% compared to 35.4% in 2013. The lower effective rate in 2014 was due to a $20 million deferred tax reduction resulting from a tax law change in Indiana. As you may recall, last year\u2019s effective rate included a $9 million reduction from tax law changes. Slide 12 displays the net income and EPS comparisons. Net income was $368 million, down $82 million or 18%. Diluted earnings per share was $1.17, down $0.24 or 17%. As I mentioned moments ago and as shown here in light blue, last year\u2019s results included a large land sale. Excluding that gain, this year\u2019s net income is 6% lower and earnings per share is 4% lower. Wrapping up the quarterly overview, cash from operations was $588 million covering capital spending and producing $207 million in free cash flow. We distributed $167 million in dividends and $50 million in share repurchases. Cash and short-term investments at the end of the period totaled $1.5 billion. Thank you. And I will now turn the program back to Wick. Wick Moorman : Well, as you have heard, we had what I would describe as a solid quarter given the weather across our service territory. While we did incur some additional expenses in our train operations year-over-year, our people did a terrific job of keeping our operations fluid under very trying conditions. Their resilience and the resilience of our network is evidenced by the metrics which Mark showed you indicating that our operations are improving steadily. It will take us several more weeks to achieve the service levels that we maintained last year and our progress will be at least partially dependent on the state of the rest of the North American rail network, but we are confident in our ability to reach those levels and continue to recognize operating productivity savings for the balance of the year. As Don told you, we also see strength across much of our book of business for the balance of 2014, coal continues to be the wildcard with utility volumes more stable, but export volumes more uncertain. We are optimistic that overall economic conditions will drive continued growth in most of our other business segments. Our goals remain unchanged to offer superior levels of service to our customers through highly efficient and effective operations and in doing so to continue to drive superior returns to our shareholders. We have a great team at Norfolk Southern and I am highly confident of our ability to do just that. Thanks, and we will open it up for your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from the line of Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Hey Don, can I ask you to talk a little about the intermodal markets, we all know we have a tight truck market, how much is the lag before you feel like you can start to take advantage of this both in volume and price terms? Don Seale : Good morning, Bill. With respect to truckload capacity and truckload pricing, we are seeing encouraging trends as you well know in the first quarter. And also as you know, a lot of our negotiations by our third parties and intermodal parties, our partners are negotiated in the first quarter for the year. So we are encouraged by where truck capacity and truck pricing is right now and we think we will get some uplift in intermodal pricing as a result of that as the year takes place. Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley : Okay. Wick can I ask you a question about the STB, we have got some hearings coming up where they will address revenue adequacy, what should we expect or what can we hope for, what will you guys be trying to get across to them in this\u2026? Wick Moorman : Well, I am not sure we know exactly what to expect. They have scheduled this hearing. We will certainly, as an industry and as Norfolk Southern, be making the case that revenue adequacy needs to be considered in terms of the long-term replacement costs for our industry rather than just the way it\u2019s computed today. And we will also certainly be making the case that to the extent that we have been able to earn better returns as an industry over the past 10 to 15 years we have taken those earnings and invested very heavily in all of our networks with the result being that the industry is in far better physical condition than it was some years ago. Our service levels are far better. We are taking a lot of trucks off the highway and we are accomplishing a lot of things that are good for the country as well as our industry. So I think we have a great case as we go into this and we will be making it very vigorously. Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley : Does the experience of the first quarter suggest that there are choke points in the system that require more investment do you have to up CapEx? Wick Moorman : Well, I think that the experience of the first quarter was certainly considerably out of the ordinary. We did see issues as you know, as everyone has commented, we certainly saw issues around Chicago, but I will say that we saw issues on other parts of our network and at other interchanges as well. And there is always the need for more infrastructure and more investment. I think that what the first quarter also made the case for is that the last thing in the world that we need to be doing right now is looking or having conversations about the possibility of decreasing our capacity through things like opening new interchanges, which are in fact not effective interchanges. So, I think there were some cautionary tales in the first quarter. I think there will be a lot of learning on the part of all of the carriers, but it certainly argues that the rail industry needs to continue the course that it\u2019s been on for the past 10 years of constant investment in infrastructure and capacity and service. Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley : Yes. Alright, thanks for the time. Wick Moorman : Thanks, Bill. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Allison Landry of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Allison Landry - Credit Suisse : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. With the improvement in the merchandise and intermodal segments which are generally thought of as having pretty solid incremental margins, do you think that within the context of an improving industrial environment, you can return to roughly 60% contribution margins similar to what you saw in 2013 or we need to add resources in terms of headcounts or equipment to handle the volumes that you are anticipating? Wick Moorman : Allison, it\u2019s a great question. I think I would tell you that right now, we feel pretty comfortable that we have the resources that we need to add the volumes that we are anticipating this year and out years without adding significant resources. We have invested a lot in over the past number of years in adding capacity and reducing pinch points on the network. We monitor our train and engine forces and mechanical and engineering forces very closely and do a lot of modeling to project what we are going to need based on our traffic forecast. We have a good locomotive fleet. We are adding more locomotives this year. We have a well-maintained fleet. So I think that we are pretty comfortable that we are not going to need significantly \u2013 any significant addition of resources to handle the business that we think is coming our way. Allison Landry - Credit Suisse : Okay, great. And then as a follow-up question, you mentioned that you are seeing pretty strong growth in your \u2013 in LPG movements. So, I just wanted to ask what you think sort of the longer term opportunity set for Norfolk is in terms of potentially moving NGLs from the Utica or Marcellus down to the Gulf Coast? Don Seale : Allison, we see continued strong growth opportunity in NGLs. Our first quarter volume was up 42% in that business. Now, some of that was weather-related, but we see continued opportunities both in Marcellus and Utica, not only for shipments to the Gulf, but shipments within our network from the south to the north and a developing export market for butanes and propanes as well. Allison Landry - Credit Suisse : Okay, very interesting. Thank you so much. Wick Moorman : Thanks, Allison. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott Group - Wolfe Research : Hey, thanks. Morning guys. So, wanted to ask about coal yields a little bit. First, I am not sure if you mentioned it, were there any liquidated damages of note in the quarter? And then Don, can you help us think about the direction of coal yields either year-over-year or sequentially from the first quarter. So, lot of moving parts with export maybe getting worse less northern utility coal, maybe that\u2019s positive for mix. I am not sure if you guys had to lower export rates further in second quarter given the lower benchmark. So, like you said a lot of moving parts, if you can give some color there, that will be great? Don Seale : Very good question. And the key word there is a lot of moving parts. In terms of the mix within coal, as I mentioned we had a decline in our northern utility base, while our southern utility business was flat. And then the export business, I will tell you our thermal business held up year-over-year better than our metallurgical coal, which is higher revenue per unit. So within coal, within the export segment, we had a negative mix effect of less metallurgical shipment activity and stable thermal coal activity. With respect to the liquidated damages, we did not have any material LDs in the quarter. So \u2013 and your other questions about pricing, our pricing was relatively stable on export coal sequentially from the fourth quarter through the first quarter. I will tell you that the metallurgical market has deteriorated further since the fourth quarter and moving through the first quarter. And we are taking a look at that with our customers and we are continuing to try to keep our customers, our met coal and thermal coal shippers competitive in their markets to the extent that we can actually impact that. And with world markets and currency exchange activity being what they are, that\u2019s a difficult task for us. Scott Group - Wolfe Research : Do you think we should expect some pressure on coal yield sequentially then because of that? Don Seale : First quarter to second quarter on met coal I think we will see some pressure on yield. Scott Group - Wolfe Research : Okay. And then just second question the labor costs, particularly given weather, just really impressive, how do we think about headcount down 4%, comp per employee down 1% going forward, can those run rates continue all year? Wick Moorman : Well, we obviously pay a lot of attention to that in terms of trying to manage our headcount. I think that as we look at additional volumes in the year, you may see some slight addition to our train and engine workforce. We still have a number of folks furloughed. We would like to get them back clearly if we can get them in the locations where we need them. But I don\u2019t see any significant pressure to increase headcount other than in that regard I am looking at Mark. Mark? Mark Manion : No, that\u2019s absolutely right. And with the \u2013 there has been a lot of good work done in the engineering, mechanical areas with some reduction through attrition and we may see a little bit more of that but it will be pretty steady through the rest of the year. Scott Group - Wolfe Research : And on the comp for employees side? Wick Moorman : Well, the comp for employee is what it is for the \u2013 by contract, so. Marta Stewart : Well, I think looking at it in total Scott, there is the two pieces. Of course the wage rate, as Wick mentioned that would put it up and then the pension and post-retirement, the pool that goes the other way. Wick Moorman : Right. And Marta has given you the run rate on that and then I am trying to remember what the contract wage increase this year is 3% plus or minus. That\u2019s baked in, so that\u2019s the way we would look at it. Scott Group - Wolfe Research : Okay, alright, great. That\u2019s good to know. Okay, thanks guys. Wick Moorman : Thanks Scott. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup: Thanks. Good morning. Maybe just a question on sort of the volume opportunity as you move here into the second quarter, how much do you think you maybe left on the table revenue wise because of the weather in the first quarter that maybe gets made up and how do you think about the cadence of potentially making that up, does it happen all in the second quarter or do you sort of see this sort of play out over the course over the next two quarters or so? Don Seale : Good morning, Chris. Good question. As I mentioned in my comments, we started to see a recovery in volumes in March relative to January and February. We did our best to estimate what the weather impact was on total shipment activity and our network versus what we expected in the first quarter. We came to a number of about 30,000 shipments that were not handled as a result of the weather. Our best estimate is that we will handle about 12,000 loads of deferred business to make up that. So if you look at average revenue per unit in the first quarter across the book of business we are talking about $18 million to $20 million of make up. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup: Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. And then I guess just thinking on the other side of the income statement on the cost side, Marta I think you mentioned $45 million of costs associated with weather, as we are sort of ramping up and getting fluidity back to the network in the second quarter, do you see any of that linger around, do we have to kind of worry about any incremental costs as you get increased ramp back up and getting those volumes sort of moving through the network again? Marta Stewart : So, I don\u2019t really think so, except for the small ramp up in T&E employees, which Mark and Wick described, the rest of the expenses that we incurred on that $45 million were just related to the weather and so they are mostly gone now. And as Mark reiterated, I mean his group is still expecting to stay on target for their productivity, improvements for the second through the fourth quarter. And so we are still expecting to actually reduce expenses in many of the operating areas. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks very much for the time. I appreciate it. Wick Moorman : Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead with your question. Jason Seidl - Cowen and Company : Real quick here, when I am looking at your intermodal network, we are seeing obviously a lot of tightness in truckload, continue here into the second quarter. Where are you at in terms of capacity and do you think you will be expanding the network in terms of adding any facilities this year? Don Seale : Good morning. With respect to the intermodal capacity as you most likely know we completed most of the credit activity with respect to new terminals and expanding levels by the end of 2013 and with Charlotte being the last facility that was opened in December. So, we have very good capacity throughout the network and we are focused on filling that network up with quality revenue with respect to new shipments. I will tell you that in the first quarter, our Crescent Corridor volumes were up 10% and our Heartland Corridor was up 9%. So, we are pleased with the volume growth activity in the quarters, but we have sufficient capacity to grow over the next four to five years before we actually start layering in additional investment. Jason Seidl - Cowen and Company : Okay, that\u2019s fantastic color. That\u2019s what I was getting at. And I guess my follow-up question, Marta, you mentioned you had a tax gain in the quarter, but you said that was due to a tax law change. So, I am assuming that is going to impact us going forward, can you give us a little more color around what we should expect? Marta Stewart : Well, Jason, that was actually deferred taxes. And so I am glad you asked that question, because it doesn\u2019t go forward. What it is, is the State of Indiana changed their laws and said beginning of 2016, they are going to reduce their state taxes. So, what we have to do at that time is adjust our deferred taxes that are already on our books. So, that\u2019s a one-time thing. That adjusted the deferred tax liability. So going forward for second through the fourth quarter, I think we are still looking at our normalized about 37.5% effective tax rate. Jason Seidl - Cowen and Company : Fantastic. That\u2019s what I was getting at. Alright guys. I appreciate the time as always. Wick Moorman : Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Thomas Kim with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs : Good morning. Just want to ask with regard to intermodal, are you seeing any signs that suggest that intermodal might be inflecting? I mean, obviously lot of this good growth is coming from the highway to rail. And international seems to be still challenged, I am wondering if you are seeing anything to give us some prospect of recovery in that side? Don Seale : Good morning. With respect to international, I think we had a consumer demand impact in the first quarter, particularly in those first two months of the first quarter. We saw our international shipment activity pick up materially in March. It continues to pick up materially in the range of about 7% in April. So, we think international growth this year is going to be fine. And of course, highway conversions in the domestic segment will continue. Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs : Okay, great. And then can you comment on what percentage of your intermodal is up for renewal or is exposed to spot? Don Seale : As of today, we are at about two-thirds of our book of business for intermodal that\u2019s priced for 2014. So that leaves us that 32%, 33% about a third that are subject to further price activity. And I will tell you a lot of that\u2019s in our EMP container fleet. Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs : Okay, that\u2019s great. Thanks a lot. Don Seale : You are welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Brandon Oglenski - Barclays: Hey, good morning everyone. Wick, I wanted to ask a more longer term question, you have had a few years here of declining coal revenues and your top line growth hasn\u2019t been as impressive as some of your western peers or Canadian peers. And obviously, the margin improvement for the other carriers outside of the East Coast has been pretty robust. Is this finally the turning point when Norfolk can start to see some pretty robust return improvement as well? I mean the top line outlook from Wick sounds pretty impressive and coal is a third less than what it used to be now. Wick Moorman : Well, I think as we said earlier, we do feel good about our volume prospects and our business prospects going forward. We hear similar comments from our customers. So, on that side, as you said I think we are optimistic. In terms of margin improvement, something we have been focused on for a long time. And you can see some of the results in terms of what we have been able to do, in terms of controlling expenses and doing additional things on the productivity side. The characteristics of railroads are different, depending upon the service territory and the west doesn\u2019t always look like the east, but I will say that we are very, very focused on growing the top line and bringing more and more of that to the bottom line every year. I feel good about all of the initiatives that Mark and his team have underway. I feel very good about the service levels that we are offering to our customers and so we continue to be optimistic. Brandon Oglenski - Barclays: Well, I appreciate that. And as a follow-up, Don I mean given the outlook and what you are sharing from your customers right now, do you think this is the time where NSC is going to see growth above GDP for the first time in a couple of years? Don Seale : Certainly I think in our Intermodal markets, in our Merchandise markets across the segments we have an opportunity this year to do just that. Coal is going to be the wildcard and we are very encouraged with respect to utility coal, we think it\u2019s going to be better than what we thought it\u2019s going to be in December, for sure. The export coal market has deteriorated in general and we are not as optimistic about that, so that will be a deflator in volume. But in the Merchandise and Intermodal segments, we feel optimistic and encouraged. Brandon Oglenski - Barclays: Alright, I appreciate it. Wick Moorman : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Justin Long - Stephens: Thanks and good morning. My first question I had I was wondering if you could talk about your access to equipment as it relates to both locomotives and freight cars, are you comfortable with the equipment capacity you have today or is that something that could be a potential limiting factor to your volume growth as you look out over the remainder of 2014? Don Seale : We feel \u2013 we do feel good about it. We are in good shape. As Wick said a little bit ago we got \u2013 we received 25 locomotives the first quarter, we have got another 50 coming in the second half and we are sized in good shape for all of our rolling equipment, so we feel good about it. Mark Manion : Just to add a comment, we do want to see our utilization of the equipment continue to improve as the national network improves its service. We have been impacted in terms of equipment supply by slower cycle times during the first quarter. I mentioned automotive equipment. We also had some other impacts with metals equipment, things like that. So as the networks recover and ours ramp up we will see more capacity in our equipment fleet by nature of turning the cars at an equal cycle to last year or better. Justin Long - Stephens: Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. And as my second question, I think I have heard you say recently that on the intermodal side you expect volume growth could be in the 5% to 10% range, as you look out over the next several years, could you talk about how much of that you expect to be driven by conversion activity versus just growth in your existing customer base, is it 50-50 split or what does that look like? Don Seale : Well, we generally don\u2019t project what we think the volume increases will be over time. I will tell you that the highway conversion opportunity is a large opportunity, with a lot of shipment and revenue moving over the highways. So we still see that as the number one opportunity for growth ahead. And we, of course, we will continue to see organic growth with our international customers based on consumer demand and consumption as well. And growth with existing domestic customers, so by far the largest growth opportunity is highway to rail. Justin Long - Stephens: Okay, great, I will leave it at that. I appreciate the time. Don Seale : Welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Ken Hoexter - Bank of America : Hi. Good morning, if we could just step back a little bit on the \u2013 Don, you mentioned that mix and pricing were down. And I know you went into detail before on the coal side, but was mix a bigger issue or did we see actual pricing contract a little bit. I just want to understand the kind of the contributors here given obviously a low inflation and I guess a portion tied to inflation indices, but just want to understand how do you look at pure pricing in this environment? Don Seale : Yes. With respect to the overall price mix equation, mix was the driver. We did not have any price degradation. As I mentioned in our export coal markets, price was essentially equal with the fourth quarter sequentially to the first quarter. Mix within coal certainly was a driver as our Lamberts Point metallurgical shipments were off by about 30% close to that or 23% was the actual number. But when you look sequentially, we saw metallurgical coal drop off from the fourth quarter to the first quarter and we saw thermal coal set this table, which thermal as you know has lower revenue per unit, which drives negative mix. Also in a larger sense of the overall book, as we continue to grow intermodal shipments and coal shipments are down, that\u2019s the ultimate in negative mix. So I know you will keep that in mind, but no, we did not have any change in our pricing structure. We did have a lot of impact on the mix side. Ken Hoexter - Bank of America : Yes. I meant more, you already went over the coal, I meant more in the other stuff, so in terms of \u2013 within any of the other commodities like you explained in coal, were there any other major things, I guess like \u2013 as you mentioned on the intermodal side outpacing coal, but was there anything on the merchandise that would mask some of that change as well? Don Seale : Yes. Ken Hoexter - Bank of America : Whether it\u2019s longer haul shifts? Don Seale : Yes. Let me give you a couple of examples. And we are going to see this throughout the year with our agricultural market. Last year as you know, we had a crop that was robust starting August/September, but the comps are coming off of a year, where we had a drought. And we had very, very suppressed corn supply. So, we were hauling long-haul corn over the Chicago gateway into processors at Decatur, Illinois into the Southeast. Now, with the grain crop being good from September/October of last year that has reverted back to normalized patterns, where we are gathering trains to Decatur that are 75 to 100 miles long as opposed to bringing that corn over Chicago from Iowa and Nebraska. So, that\u2019s a great example of \u2013 that\u2019s going to continue as normalized patterns replace unusual patterns for grain shipment. So that\u2019s negative mix in the ag market. In terms of other merchandise activity, I will tell you that our crude oil was up about 60% in the first quarter in our chemical group. And while our chemical group had good performance with RPU and volume, as we have indicated in the past, our crude RPU is less than our chemical RPU on average. So, it is a negative mix driver within chemicals. So, not to go on, but yes, there is a lot of moving parts mix overall. Again, merchandise was not positive, it was negative. And it certainly was negative in coal. And as we add more intermodal to the overall book of business, that is a negative mix indicator quarter-to-quarter. Ken Hoexter - Bank of America : That\u2019s a great one and that\u2019s exactly what I was looking for. Just I guess two quick ones together, but on export, I know you tend to shy away from giving forecasts, but could you see given where the market prices are now, could you see that a sub 20 million ton year given the pace of declines? And then I guess a quick one for Marta, you have got a $1.5 billion on hand, any comments on what your plans are for that? Don Seale : Again, on the export we are just going to have to see how it progresses. It is a very, very unstable market right now because of foreign competition. Foreign demand in China was softening. You know all those factors, I am sure, but we will just have to see how it progresses. Marta Stewart : And on the cash level that we have, we do have a lot of cash on hand, $1.5 billion as you noted. And we still have our same order of spending, which is Wick mentioned first of all is investing in business and then dividends and then share repurchases. And the amount is somewhat elevated, because we had two debt issuances last year trying to capture the low interest rates, which we didn\u2019t know would last so far into this year, but other than that, other than a little extra carry that we have from that, we still are going to continue our strategy of trying to over the long-term get our debt structure set up, so that we have a good weighted average interest rate for the company. Ken Hoexter - Bank of America : I appreciate the time. Thanks for the insight. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets : Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. My question I guess is on the regulatory side with regards to crude by rail up here in Canada, they just released indications today that they will be requiring the DOT-111 cars to be pushed out of service in a two to three year timeframe. That seems like a little bit quicker than I think the industry was expecting in terms of the cycling out of the DOT-111s, do you see that as impacting your business in crude, talking to your crude by rail customers you were to change partners, is 2 to 3 years going to put a strain on the car manufactures to be able to bring in the new generation of those same cars and therefore limit the potential upside that you see of the volume growth in crude by rail going forward? Wick Moorman : Well, it\u2019s certainly an issue and we had heard that there would be something coming out along the lines you mentioned in Canada. I think that we going to have to remain \u2013 it remains to be seen what the regulators do down here in terms of the phase out of the 111s if it\u2019s a very rapid phase out it\u2019s clearly going to be an issue. There are a lot of tank cars being built to the 12-32 standard right now, there is clearly going to be a change in that standard at some point or another as well and I think we are all just watching to see what happens. But it\u2019s very clear that if the regulators aren\u2019t thoughtful about what they are doing and looking at how we can get enough of the newer cars into the fleet that it could be a limiting impact on the shipment of crude by rail. So we will just watch and see what happens in the U.S. and what the regulators come up with. But it\u2019s clearly something to be concerned about and watchful about. Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets : In two to three years would qualify as that very limiting timeframe? Wick Moorman : I would have to go back and look at the projected production of the current car standard. But as I have said, that standard will change as well. But I think that timeframe would probably present some problems for us. Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets : Yes, thanks for that. My second question I guess is more on the longer term, I guess Marta you mentioned investing in your business is the first order priority. If you take a step back and I know you did this with your intermodal business a number of years ago and looked at pinch points within your Southern corridors and decided to invest in there to expand your double stack capacity. If you take that same kind of approach and I don\u2019t know if Mark, you are the best one to answer this, if you look at your pinch points, I got a sense from Wick that perhaps Chicago, and correct me if I am wrong is not as big a problem for you as it was at least in terms of the commentary, sounded like the Canadian rails and Burlington Northern are suffering a little bit more from Chicago than the others. If you take a step back, where are your pinch points and where could we see any let\u2019s call it meaningful capital dollars going towards in terms of those pinch points? Mark Manion : Yes, well as far as Chicago, we have faired pretty well in Chicago actually. When you say pinch points, when I think about that, we have been for \u2013 what since like 2004, 2005 we have every year very deliberately been investing in additional infrastructure. And these days, with the kind of tools that you have in order to really identify the spots that will make the difference to you. We added a little bit of double track. We linked in sidings. We added sidings. We put in crossings. And you put them in the areas surgically where it really gets you a lot of bang for your buck. And so we have done that every year for at least 10 years. And when you do that over a period of time, it\u2019s got to be effective of really ramping up your capacity. So that\u2019s something we have really enjoyed as far as helping us with fluidity. And we will continue to do that, so that\u2019s a very good thing. So at this point, I wouldn\u2019t say that we have any spots that we are really particularly worried about. We are looking, with the computer modeling we do, we look out three years and we try to look out a little further than that. But realistically speaking, we look out three years with our modeling and we anticipate where those areas are. That\u2019s what we will continue to do. And our latest project that we have got on the books, Bellevue, that\u2019s a significant spend. And we are virtually doubling the capacity up at Bellevue, because the forecasting tells us and what we are currently experiencing is that that\u2019s where a lot of traffic wants to go, up in that Northern Ohio area. So, that will be a big help to us. So, we will keep planning ahead and spending accordingly to try to alleviate pinch points before they come. Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets : Alright, looking forward to seeing the Bellevue operation there in September. Wick Moorman : Great. Love to see you up there. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Larkin with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. John Larkin - Stifel: Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to circle back on the loss of the, I think you said 4 million ton Northern Appalachian utility contract. Wanted to understand if the coal is moving maybe by water, whether that was a natural gas substitution situation or whether the coal supplier changed or whether it was an aggressive pricing action on the part of a rail competitor? Don Seale : Good morning, John. Its PRB coal coming over Chicago and it was rail-to-rail competition. John Larkin - Stifel: But you don\u2019t think that\u2019s indicative of a heating up of a price competition in the utility coal market? Don Seale : We don\u2019t see that as an indicator of that, but obviously it\u2019s a competitive market and we continue to monitor all conditions in the market. John Larkin - Stifel: Got it. There has been a lot written in the press here lately about the possibility of a West Coast strike, the port workers out there perhaps shutting things down around mid-year. Have you seen shippers begin to take steps to protect themselves perhaps by shifting more freight to East Coast or is that underway currently or is it too early to make a call on that? Don Seale : John, we think it\u2019s too early to make the call with respect to the ILWU negotiation on the West Coast. But I will say that we are continuing to see robust growth in our all-water international service to the East Coast. And that\u2019s been an ongoing trend, as we have reported previously, but we are seeing robust growth over our East Coast ports. John Larkin - Stifel: And just to follow along on that, any thoughts, perhaps new thoughts on what may happen when ultimately the Panama Canal is finished and the larger vessels can proceed through the canal to the East Coast ports? Don Seale : Well, we know that, that will take place late 2015 maybe early 2016. Now, in the ensuing time, we are seeing more activity with the larger vessels coming through the Suez Canal to the East Coast ports, that can accommodate the large draft vessels like the Port of Virginia, Norfolk or Baltimore, those are the two that can do that right now. Chinese production is changing with labor cost and productivity changing in China and we are seeing more of those goods coming to the U.S. from Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Malaysia. And as that shift in production continues, we expect the Suez activity to continue to grow to the East Coast. We are seeing very solid signs of that today. So, bottom line, the Panama Canal completion, it will be material with respect to being able to handle the larger vessels. We expect to see more large or Cape-size export coal vessels, for example, go through the Panama Canal, but the question mark is just how \u2013 what kind of an impact it will make on containerization and containerships with that shift in production. John Larkin - Stifel: Thank you very much. Wick Moorman : Thanks, John. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rob Salmon of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank : Hey, thanks for taking my question. As a quick follow-up to John\u2019s questions about the potential for a dockworker uncertainty on the West Coast as that contract comes up for expiration toward the middle of the summer, can you give us a sense of what customers have been saying to you, Don, about their expectations for bringing the imports in or are they indicating they are planning on bringing freight in early as a contingency plan? Don Seale : We do not have a strong indication that there is a ship ahead taking place, but with the strength of our April international numbers, we would deduce from that, that we are seeing some activity that might be related to a shift. We are just not being told that yet by our customers. Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank : Yes. They typically hold those cards pretty close to their chests. Mark, as a follow-up to an earlier question about the operating leverage potential across your network, could you give us a sense of how much train lengths can extend on average across your merchandise network before you will have to start adding additional train starts? Mark Manion : Well, we have had some pretty good success actually in the first quarter with adding to train length and we actually on the Merchandise side we have added a little bit, about 3%, on the Intermodal side we added about 5%. And there is still a lot of room. And of course the trick \u2013 the balancing trick here is you got some trains out there that are 10,000 feet long and you got others that are 5,000 feet long. So we make our networking people, they do a good job and they make a deliberate effort to try to work with marketing and try to increase train length where we can. And right now where we have got our Merchandise trains somewhere in that 5,000 foot little bit less average length, in nearly all cases we can go up to at least 8,000 feet. So there is a lot of room to go there and that\u2019s what we will continue to do. Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank : That\u2019s all from me. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question is from the line of John Mims with FBR Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. John Mims - FBR Capital Markets : Great. Thanks guys. Thanks for squeezing me in here at the end. There has been a lot of questions on intermodal, but let me beat that horse a couple of more times. When you look at the growth that you anticipate with the Southern build-out of the Crescent Corridor and the South Carolina Inland Port or Charlotte, etcetera, is there a negative mix issue that we should be aware of from a shortening length of haul. I know you are optimistic about core pricing increasing with truckload, but do you see length of haul shortening given where the growth is coming from? Mark Manion : Well, certainly as we continued to convert highway business within our local East network, we are seeing length of haul opportunities that are below our average today. And also we are seeing projects like the Inland Port in South Carolina where we are using double stack efficiencies to run dedicated trains between the Port of Charleston and Greer, South Carolina. That is well below, that\u2019s in the 240 mile, 250 mile segment, well below our average length of haul of about 740 miles. So we are going to continue to see opportunities with double stack technology using a network that\u2019s 98% clear for double stack where we can convert highway business that has length of haul and RPU characteristics that are below the average, but are highly accretive to what we are doing financially. John Mims - FBR Capital Markets : Right. So lower RPU but in line incremental margins for that trade? Mark Manion : Equal or greater. John Mims - FBR Capital Markets : Equal or greater, okay. And then I heard recently, I was talking to some of the container manufactures that the 53 foot box backlog and demand outlook for 2014 is very robust, probably the strongest in years, can you talk a little about what you are buying in terms of boxes for the EMP fleet, the growth that you anticipate for some of your key IMC partners. And then how comfortable you are, I guess on a broader term over the next couple quarters with U.S. domestic box capacity given that some of your big Western partners are probably going to take longer to recover, there are seeing some sloppy capacity tied up in the West, how quickly does the box capacity need to come online to meet the growth that you anticipate from the highway conversion market? Don Seale : Well, certainly box capacity will continue to expand this year, not only in our EMP fleet, and our contribution. We are acquiring about 2,000 containers and chasses to support that. Our Western partner and EMP UP is also participating in the expansion of EMP. And I will point out that our Intermodal marketing partners are also expanding their fleets in a fairly significant way. So as we add those additional units and the national network continues to improve in terms of velocity, we think we will have the capacity there for the growth that we had targeted for 2014. And certainly beyond \u201814 we are all modeling what that growth will be and what the capacity enhancements will need to be as well as replacements. John Mims - FBR Capital Markets : Given that there has been a pretty substantial step-up in 53 foot boxes orders in 2014 versus 2013 have you seen that reflected in the prices that you are paying for the 2,000 EMP boxes? Don Seale : No, we had our prices committed to. So we are not seeing a price impact. John Mims - FBR Capital Markets : Great. Okay, thanks so much. I will turn it back over. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman, Buckingham Research. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham Research : Thank you very much. Hi, everyone. Question for Marta and then a follow-up on CapEx, Ken Hoexter earlier asked about the $1.5 billion in cash and you do have $440 million due later this year, following up on your thoughts, it just seems like normally you guys hold closer to $500 million in cash and is your thought maybe to pay off the $440 million later this year in cash and bring cost of debt down that way or your share repurchase seems a little lower than I would have thought it would have been with that kind of cash balance, can you just give us a little bit more detail into your thoughts on making the balance sheet better and why you should have $1 billion more cash than normal? Marta Stewart : Yes, Jeff. Well, you are right that we have, I believe in September we have a debt payoff this year. And so we are going to wait until closer to that time period to decide whether we are going to use cash on the balance sheet or refinance that. As I have said, we are a little bit high now, because we had the two debt issuances last year in order to try to get that long-term interest rate down for the future. If we have known that interest rates were going to stay low into this spring, we would have issued that $400 million. We would have issued one of them this year. That having been said, we always look to the capital first and Mark spoke it\u2019s not terribly significant, but Mark spoke did pull off a little bit on the capital work in the first quarter as they shifted resources to deal with the weather. And so we will still expect to have the $2.2 billion capital plan for the entire year, but it will be \u2013 some of it will be shifted later, so some of the money will be absorbed that way. And we announced our regular quarterly dividend yesterday, so we will keep looking that was our run rate same as the first quarter, but we will keep looking at the dividends and we have a history of steadily increasing those. So, we will look at the dividend \u2013 and the share repurchases really are going to be based on what the market is doing and the alternative uses of our cash. So truly, even though the balance is higher we have not changed our priority order and we will just have to see in September what we do with that debt. Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham Research : Okay. Just we already had you pegged for the $2.2 billion in CapEx and we have got you now projected closer to $2 billion in cash at year end, and I guess we will see the answer. Going to CapEx then and use of cash, you got the Tier 4 locomotive standards that start at the end of this year. Can you give us an idea of what your thoughts are around locomotive CapEx? And any thoughts you have on continuing down a Tier 4 locomotive path with the current diesel versus some of the natural gas technologies that are out there that are being tested? Wick Moorman : Well, it\u2019s a good question. As Mark told you, we are picking up 75 new locomotives this year. We will look later in the year obviously, but it\u2019s unclear to us that we are going to move into Tier 4 in 2014. It\u2019s a new technology. We are certainly going to want to see it prove out. We are going to look at the pricing of those locomotives. And we are going to continue to look as all of the carriers are at the development work that\u2019s being done in LNG. I think that\u2019s a very interesting and promising technology. It\u2019s probably a year or two out from being proven. There are still regulatory issues as you know, but I think we want to keep some powder dry in terms of that technology. Remember at the same time that we do have a very active locomotive, road locomotive rebuild program at our shops in Juniata. So, we are this year and this will continue for a number of years, continuing to take some of our older road locomotives and essentially rebuilding them in kind and producing what we feel to be pretty close to a like-new product. So that keeps our locomotive fleet rejuvenated as well. So, we think we have a good thoughtful program. Clearly, we want to do two things. One is ensure that we have the locomotive resources to move the businesses effectively but also to manage our capital as prudently as we can. Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham Research : Okay, thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is from the line of David Vernon of Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. David Vernon - Sanford Bernstein : Alright, thanks you for taking the question. Don just a question for you on Intermodal rates, how closely should we expect Norfolk\u2019s portion of that rate to track with truck ate inflation. I am trying to think if that should be one-for-one or if you would expect some leakage to pay for the yard to door truck rate inflation that would also presumably be going up? Don Seale : Well, certainly rail pricing over time we will track truckload pricing, that\u2019s the lead indicator. Of course rail-to-rail competition is present as well. But I think we certainly are optimistic that we are seeing a truckload market that's beginning to inflect with higher capacity and the need to improve pricing, which certainly will support further improvement in Intermodal pricing. David Vernon - Sanford Bernstein : Is it going to be a little bit less than the one-for-one that you would see in truck rate inflation? Don Seale : I think it will be a little bit less than the one-for-one. David Vernon - Sanford Bernstein : Okay, great. And then, Marta, maybe just as a quick follow-up, the $160 million kind of year-over-year reduction in pension and post-retirement benefits, what\u2019s the baseline for that. I am looking at $177 million was your cost last year, is that full number just coming down the $17 million for your average benefit costs this year? Marta Stewart : That\u2019s correct, David. The $177 million is in our footnote and that\u2019s the total of pension and post-retirement medical. And so the $32 million in the first quarter plus $40 million each of the next quarters would be what you would expect that to in total to come down. David Vernon - Sanford Bernstein : So if we saw rates go up again in next year, is there a chance that you can start to see a net periodic benefit in your labor line? Marta Stewart : Well, it all depends, as you know the components of the pension depends on the discount rate and also what our assets do. And so the amortization for years past 2015 will depend on what happens with interest rates and with our pension plan assets, which so far this year as you would expect are doing very well. David Vernon - Sanford Bernstein : Excellent. Thanks very much for the clarification. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Keith Schoonmaker with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question. Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar: Thanks. Quick question on coal, you mentioned the last call volume was PRB, what was the quarter\u2019s utility coal mix by source basin and would you share your expectations for this over the next couple years please? Don Seale : Yes, in terms of our mix of coal sourcing, Illinois Basin was about 18%, PRB was about 16%, Central App was a little over 40% and Northern App made up the balance. Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar: And could you add a little color on how this shift towards more the Western Basin is affecting your length of haul expectations too? Don Seale : Well, the Illinois Basin affords us with opportunities to \u2013 for extended haul, so length of haul that\u2019s helping. Also Northern App coal that is beginning to flow materially into the South, that\u2019s helping as well. The PRB coal really doesn't change our length of haul because it\u2019s a fairly stable pattern with the Memphis Gateway, that\u2019s gateway receive traffic. And we don\u2019t see a lot of change in that ahead, so stable length of haul there extended length of haul on Northern App to the South as that develops and extended hauls from Illinois Basin to the South as it develops. Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar: Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Cleo Zagrean with Macquarie Group. Please proceed with your question. Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Group : Thank you. I am following up right on Keith\u2019s question with another take of the basin mix. After the congestion issues that are still lingering through this year, how do you see your mix changing, maybe more PRB suffer, do you see more of the Appalachian coal come into the mix and what should that mean for the profitability of your coal franchise this year? Thank you. Don Seale : We believe that as utilities restock their stockpiles, which are down materially coming off the winter, we believe that we will see more Illinois Basin coal going to the South. We will see more Northern App coal flowing into the South, into North Carolina in particular. PRB coal will expand on the margin to replenish stockpiles, primarily in the Southeast for us. And as far as the margins go, the overall mix should be favorable in utility on that incremental business as it moves longer haul from the Illinois Basin as well as Northern App. Central App utility business still higher cost, but we do expect some volume increases out of Central App. We believe that increase will be less than from Northern App and from Illinois Basin. Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Group : Thank you. And as a follow-up also on the margin issue, could you please remind us of the big picture on margins on the operating ratio as you see the business mix evolves and adding your productivity initiatives? I mean, we are trying to see sort of the noise at the level of the unit price through incremental margins and several other colleagues have attempted this question, but if you could set us straight again on how we should think of margins a few years out? Thank you. Mark Manion : We have a goal obviously of continuing to push the operating ratio down and our margins up. We don\u2019t forecast what that will be, but I think that we do have opportunity for some more improvements on that and I would hope that a few years out we will have driven the operating ratio maybe down a few points, but that\u2019s going to depend a lot on market conditions and on a lot of other factors that are out there. But the best answer I can give you is that we are focused on trying to continue to drive the operating ratio down. Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Group : Can you highlight any one movement in business mix or one productivity initiative that should be a main driver in improvement? Mark Manion : No, I think that when you look at our business mix, it\u2019s obviously volatile in terms of coal. We have solid growth prospects in the others, but the volatility in coal will have an impact on our overall margins. And in terms of productivity, I think that we have a lot of initiatives underway. None of them in and of themselves are a particularly defining moment, from a productivity standpoint, but when you look at them all together they are going to do a lot for our bottom line. Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Group : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Tyler Brown of Raymond James. Please proceed with your question. Tyler Brown - Raymond James : Hey, good morning. Mark, just quickly, can you give us an update on where you are on the movement plan to rollout, maybe when all the 11 divisions will be fully implemented? And then in the divisions where you did see it implemented this year, did your network respond better given the weather? Mark Manion : We will complete that project by the end of this year or just barely into next year. So we are getting close. And we have done a good bit of analysis looking at movement planner to determine what kind of improvement we get in velocity. And it is still looking like we are in that 2 to 4 mile an hour or 10% to 20% range, it\u2019s early. So, those are approximate figures, but we think that just like it\u2019s helpful during the good weather, it\u2019s helpful during the bad weather. So, we think it\u2019s very promising. Tyler Brown - Raymond James : Okay, good. And then Don just within the domestic intermodal games, was there kind of anything unusual there, I know you guys don\u2019t break it out anymore, but did the premium traffic perform better than usual? I just noted that your TOFC volumes are pretty good? Don Seale : Yes, we had a significant increase in our premium in LTL traffic in the first quarter. This ranges from UPS to FedEx to the various western frontload carriers. Tyler Brown - Raymond James : And just real quickly do you expect that to continue and how does that impact yield? Don Seale : We expect further growth in our business for parcel activity and LTL. Tyler Brown - Raymond James : Perfect, thanks. Operator : Thank you. We have come to the end of our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the floor back over to Mr. Moorman for closing comments. Wick Moorman : Thanks everyone for the questions this morning. And we look forward to seeing you again and talking to you next quarter. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

Welcome to the Norfolk Southern Corporation Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Katie Cook, Director of Investor Relations for Norfolk Southern. Thank you, Ms. Cook. You may now begin. Katie Cook : Thank you, Rob, and good morning. Before we begin today\u2019s call, I would like to mention a few items. First, the slides of the presenters are available on our website at nscorp.com in the Investors section. Additionally, transcripts and downloads of today\u2019s call will be posted on our website. Please be advised that any forward-looking statements made during the course of the call represent our best, good faith judgment as to what may occur in the future. Statements that are forward-looking can be identified by the use of words such as believe, expect, anticipate and project. Our actual results may differ materially from those projected and will be subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which may be outside of our control. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for discussions of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. Additionally, keep in mind that all references to reported results, excluding certain adjustments, that is, non-GAAP numbers, have been reconciled on our website in the Investors section. Now, it is my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern Chairman and CEO, Wick Moorman. Wick Moorman : Thank you, Katie, and good morning, everyone. It\u2019s my pleasure to welcome you to our second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. With me today are several members of our senior team, including our President, Jim Squires; our Chief Marketing Officer, Don Seale; our Chief Operating Officer, Mark Manion; and our Chief Financial Officer, Marta Stewart. I am very pleased to report that Norfolk Southern's second quarter financial results set all time records across the Board. Earnings for the quarter were $1.79 per share, up 23%, compared with $1.46 we earned in the second quarter of last year. These very strong results reflect a substantial increase in demand, coupled with our continuing effective cost control. Overall traffic was up 8%, reflecting a double-digit rise in intermodal, along with increases in both merchandise and coal. These strong volumes resulted in record revenues, which topped $3 billion, a $240 million or 9% increase versus last year. Don will fill you in on all of the details of these gains in a few minutes. At the same time, our expenses were up only 3% despite the volume surge and some continuing slow down in our network velocity. Our resulting 66.5% operating ratio set an all time quarterly record. To put the volume growth in perspective, our weekly volumes averaged about 153,000 loads in the second quarter of this year, compared with only 141,000 loads on average in last year's second quarter. In fact, we only saw volumes exceed 150,000 loads in two weeks, up all of 2013 and in contrast we have seen only three weeks of less than 150,000 loads since the last week in March of this year. Now going immediately from the severe winter weather that we experienced to this kind of volume growth has obviously created some challenges for us, but our operating team has clearly risen to the occasion. Our network continues to be fluid and stable, although our service metrics are not yet back to last year's level. Mark will give you the numbers as well as describe our initiatives to improve network velocity. While the network slowdown in our recovery efforts did give rise to some added cost, our overall expense control was strong and Marta will go over all of the financials with you in more detail. To sum it up, it was a great quarter for our company and while we don't necessarily see the same kind of volume growth being sustained for the balance of 2014, our results show the strength of our franchise and our potential for ongoing improvement. In recognition of this potential, I am also very pleased that our Board increased our dividends yesterday by $0.03 per share or 6%. And on that note, I'll turn the program over to Don, Mark and Marta and then I'll return with some closing remarks before we take your questions. Don? Don Seale : Thank you, Wick and good morning, everyone. The second quarter of 2014 as Wick stated was Norfolk Southern's first $3 billion quarter, with revenue growth of $240 million or 9%, compared to second quarter of last year. Revenue in all three primary business units increased with intermodal up 11% followed by merchandise at 8% and coal up 7%. With respect to the quarterly revenue variance, our volume increase of almost 145,000 generated $221 million in addition revenue, while improved pricing and positive fuel surcharge revenue largely offset the negative mix effect of having higher volumes of intermodal traffic. Turning to the next slide, despite higher intermodal volumes, our overall revenue per unit increased by 1% in the quarter with steady price increases among most business units. Coal revenue per unit was up 5%, due primarily to longer lengths of haul for utility coal, which offset the negative mix effect of lower volumes of export coal. In our merchandise segment, RPU was up 2% in spite of negative mix effects from higher short haul movements in the metals and construction and agricultural product segments. Lastly, our intermodal sector experienced positive pricing, which was offset by the negative mix effects of increased international volumes, which have lower revenue per unit characteristics compared to domestic shipments. Now turning to the details of our volume for the quarter, total shipments increased 8% due primarily to increases in metals and construction, intermodal, coal, crude oil, natural gas liquids and housing related commodities. Intermodal volume was up 11%, driven by organic growth and new business and international coupled with continued strength in our domestic market and highway conversion programs. Our merchandise market also experienced strong growth led by our metals and construction franchise, which was up 13%, followed by chemicals up 7% and agriculture at 5%. Volume growth of 9,000 units in coal was primarily from increases in the utility sector, which were offset by decreases in our export traffic. Turning to the next slide, focusing on our individual market segment starting with coal, coal revenue was up $46 million or 7%, which was our first quarterly revenue increase in coal since 2011. This gain was led by our southern utility business which grew by 23%, partially offset by a 3% decline in northern utility volume. The utility coal demand has improved as a result of higher natural gas prices and stock pile replenishment coming out of a harsh winter. The eastern utility stock piles remain down by 18% compared to December 2013 levels. In the export market segment, volumes were down 13% as thermal supply competition remains very strong in Europe. The API 2 index to Western Europe is currently in the $70 range, pushing U.S. thermal coals out of the market. Export metallurgical coal is also being impacted by weak seaborne pricing and strong Australian competition. In our domestic metallurgical coal market, we saw a 7% decline in our volume compared to the second quarter of last year as the steel market remains oversupplied and we experienced the impact of two plant closures in Canada. Finally, industrial coal volumes increased by a strong 24, due primarily to new business gains. Now let's turn to intermodal. Intermodal revenue in the quarter increased by $62 million or 11% to $650 million, which is an all-time high record for this high growth business segment. International shipments grew by 16% due to strong general market expansion, new projects and advanced shipments ahead of the ILWU labor contract negotiations at West Coast ports. The increase in our domestic volumes continues to be driven by highway conversions across all of our business segments. We're seeing organic growth in our large key accounts as well as increased use of intermodal by recently acquired premium and truck load customers. Our targeted quarter initiatives, which we've discussed with you in the past, coupled with associated infrastructure improvements made over the past 10 years are providing the necessary tools to grow our business efficiently and profitably and we're continuing to work on increased velocity and performance across this best-in-class intermodal network. On Slide seven, we focus on our merchandise markets, which in the quarter increased by $132 million or 8% to $1.7 billion, metals and construction led this growth with 13% more volume generated by higher volumes of frac sand shipments to the Marcellus and Utica shale regions. Growth in the imported slabs through our East Coast ports and also increased coil steel due to continued strength in the automotive sector. The 5% gain we saw in agriculture was driven by year-over-year improvement in shipments of corn, due to increased demand and processing, primarily for ethanol production. Additionally, expanded export activity led to higher volumes of soybeans and wheat. In our chemical franchise we continue to see increases in crude by rail, natural gas liquids and other chemical commodities used in growing automotive and housing markets. Automotive car supply constrains across the North America network moderated automotive volumes in the quarter. But as shown on the chart, our automotive volumes increased by 3% in the quarter despite these challenges. Lastly, volume within our paper clay and forest products group was down 1% for the quarter, due primarily to the impact of the recent closure of an international paper mill in Northern Alabama. On a positive note, these declines were largely offset by continued strength in the wood products markets for both lumber and wood chips. Now let's conclude with our outlook for the balance of 2014, we remain optimistic that we'll continue to generate growth across most of our business units. The utility coal shipments are expected to be up throughout the rest of the year, as gas prices remain elevated and stock piles are replenished, but overall coal volumes will be tempered by weaker export met and thermal coal market conditions along with lower domestic met coal shipments. Turning to intermodal, as truck capacity tightens, we anticipate continued volume growth and pricing opportunity in our domestic network. For example, in our rail-owned domestic container segment, we successfully increased transcon rates 4% on June 1st and will be taking a 3% increase on our local EMP freight effective September 1. These two business segments together represent 17% of our total domestic intermodal book. We also expect continued volume increases in our international intermodal business, but we expect the pace of growth in this sector to moderate somewhat in the second half. In our merchandise businesses, we expect growth across most market segments. In chemicals, crude by rail continues to be strong. Last year, as you'll recall, we handled approximately 75,000 car loads of crude oil and we expect our full year 2014 volume to be well in excess of 100,000 car loads with substantial opportunity for continued growth in 2015. And natural gas related commodities such as frac sand and liquid petroleum gases are expected to continue to increase as well. In metals, U.S. steel production is projected to increase 3% for this year and we continue to see growth across most of these markets. In automotive, our automotive volume should continue to improve as car supply becomes more fluid and production increases by over 4% this year. In our agricultural markets, favorable growing conditions for another robust soybean and corn crop should lead to strong year-over-year gains ahead. Lastly, with housing starts expected to grow by 15% this year, we expect continuing volume increase and housing related commodities such as plastics for carbon, soda ash going into the manufacturing of glass, steel for appliances, synthetic gypsum for wallboard and in asphalt and aggregates for paving. In summary, to wrap it up we expect continued volume and revenue growth ahead across most of our intermodal and merchandise market segments and in utility coal in the second half. With respect to our yield management plan, as we've shared with you in the past, we remain committed to providing improved service to our customers that supports our ability to price to market at levels that equal or exceed rail inflation and which supports further investments in our network. Thanks for your attention, and I'll now turn the mic over to Mark for his comments on our operations. Mark? Mark Manion : Okay. Thank you, Don. For the second quarter, operations were definitely affected by the very positive traffic growth on the heels of a difficult operating environment in the first quarter, the higher volumes presented a new set of challenges for our operations and slowed our progress in returning the network to targeted service levels and network velocity. However, it did demonstrate that we have a physical capacity in the network for future growth. It also pointed out that going forward, we need to find ways to respond more quickly to changing market forces, particularly with respect to train and engine employees. Turning to Slide two for a review of safety performance, we saw solid improvement in the second quarter, reportable personal injuries dropped to 0.88. For the first six months, the injury ratio stands at 1.19. Furthermore, our serious injury has not increased. We also saw improvement in the rate of train incidents in the second quarter, down to two incidents per million train miles. For the first six months, the train incident rate is 2.3 per million train miles. Crossing accident rates were up slightly to 3.8 per million train miles for both the second quarter and the first half of the year. Results traded on Slide three our composite service metric improved modestly from 73.4% in the first quarter to 74.5% in the second quarter, but remains well below the high service levels of 2012 and 2013. For the first six months, the service composite was 74%. Our network has remained very fluid with no significant bottlenecks due to physical constraints; however, service performance and network velocity remained below targeted levels due to accrue base that was planned for lower traffic volumes. Based on recent business growth trends and an updated business outlook, we've stepped up hiring and training in order to align T&E forces with expected volumes. Looking at employment for the total company during the second quarter, we had about 900 fewer employees versus full year 2013 average. With the additional T&E hiring, we expect that we will ramp back up to the 2013 employment level by the end of 2014. Train speed shows similar trends and for the very same reasons. In the second quarter train speed fell to 21.8 miles an hour for the first six months of 2014 train speed was 22.4 miles per hour. In addition to the efforts in crew hiring, we also pressed on locomotive availability. Not only did we have all our seats surge fleet deployed, but we also stepped up repair activity to increase the total number of available locomotives. As Marta will discuss with you, this resulted in higher costs, but it was well worth to assist in the recovery. This point is illustrated by our next slide of our dwell times. As you know terminal dwell is the second major component of network velocity and it improved by 6% from 25 hours in the first quarter to 23.4 hours in the second quarter. Terminal dwell remains above the high performance levels in the last couple of years and we will also improve over coming months with improved crew availability. Moving to the next slide, with a volume increase of 8% in the second quarter, crew starts actually declined by 1%. This margin of difference is in part due to conserving crews through train combinations and train enrolments. However, we would still see a very positive margin even with a more robust crew base. Our current crew base is clearly stretched, which is reflected in higher overtime hours and increased re-crews up 20% and 23% respectively for the second quarter compared to the same period last year. With the hiring plans I outlined, network velocity will improve over the coming months and we\u2019ll see that improvement reflected -- and further improvements in operating efficiencies, particularly reductions in overtime and re-crews. Higher volumes were largely absorbed with the existing train operation resulting in a 4% improvement in carloads per locomotive. Our fuel utilization was also favorable as gallons per 1,000 gross ton miles declined by 4% compared to the same period last year. Thank you and I would like to take just a minute to recognize all of our operating department employees. The first and second quarters presented different, but very difficult operating challenges. As always, our people rise to meet every challenge. That\u2019s the Norfolk Southern spirit and Marta, now I turn it over to you. Marta Stewart : Thank you, Mark and good morning everyone. Let\u2019s take a look at how all of that strong volume translated into second quarter financial results. As shown on Slide two and as Wick and Don already mentioned, our operating results were strong. Railway operating revenues of over $3 billion rose $240 million or 9% versus 2013, while operating expenses increased only $57 million or 3%. This improved leverage, resulted in a best ever quarterly operating ratio of 66.5. The next slide shows the major components of the $57 million net increase in railway operating expenses, which as you can see, were largely concentrated in materials and other and in fuel. Now, let\u2019s take a closer look at each of these variances. The materials and other category increased by $35 million or 16%. About $20 million of this was due to higher casualties and other claims as the prior year had a large favorable personnel injury adjustment. In addition, about $10 million of the increase is related to higher material usage, primarily for locomotive repairs. As Mark discussed, our search fleet is fully deployed. As you would imagine, those locomotives typically require more maintenance. In addition, we had some spillover of locomotive work related to weather issues from the first quarter. With the anticipated demand that Don described, we plan to continue to use those older locomotives in the second half of the year. Therefore, you can expect a similarly elevated level of material spending. At displayed on the following slide, the $17 million or 4% increase in fuel expense was almost entirely due to higher consumption. Gallons used were up 4% on the 8% increase in traffic volume. Next, depreciation expense rose by $12 million or 5% reflective of our larger capital base. As shown on the left hand side of the slide our fixed assets before depreciation are $1.3 billion higher than this time last year. Slide seven addresses the $4 million or 1% rise in purchase services and risks. Most of this increase was due to higher volume related cost, in particular equipment rents, joint facilities and intermodal terminal cost. Somewhat offsetting these volumetric increases were lower professional service fees as well as lower expenses associated with the shared asset theory. Slide eight details the $11 million or 2% decrease in compensation and benefit cost. As we previously discussed, the first quarter amendment to our retiring medical plan along with strong equity returns in 2013 and a lower discount rate resulted in a decline of about $40 million in post retirement medical and pension accruals. In addition, health and welfare benefit costs were slightly lower for the quarter. Partly offsetting these declines were higher incentive compensation, increased pay rates and increased overtime. The higher incentive comp was due to bonus accruals related to the strong operating results as well as to higher stock-based compensation. Overtime increased by $9 million and was mostly incurred in two areas of our workforce, employees who operate our trains and employees who repair equipment, principally locomotives. We expect a somewhat elevated level of overtime for the remainder of the year. As Mark described, we have already hired and will be continuing to hire train and engine employees. So the overtime in that area should gradually moderate as the employees become qualified. Slide nine depicts our second quarter income from operations. With revenues up 9% and expenses up just 3%, the operating margin expanded by 22% and exceeded $1 billion for the first time in the company\u2019s history. Turning to our non-operating items, both categories were $11 million, unfavorable for the quarter. Other income net declined by 38% due primarily to reduced coal royalties associated with lower coal production. And interest expense on debt was up 9% due to the last year\u2019s debt issuances. Slide 11 shows our bottom line results with record quarterly net income of $562 million up 21% compared to 2013 and deluded earnings per share of $1.79 up 23% versus last year. Wrapping up our financial overview on Slide 12, cash from operations for the first six months was $1.4 billion covering capital spending and producing $628 million in free cash flow. Although capital spending year-to-date is somewhat behind last year\u2019s pace, we still continue to project full year CapEx of $2.2 billion. Within this total amount, we have reallocated resources to acquire some used locomotives and to enhance capacity. With respect to stockholder returns, we repurchased 100 million of our shares and paid $335 million in dividends. These dividends reflect a $0.54 per share amount paid in the first and second quarters. As Wick mentioned, our Board yesterday raised the dividend rate to $0.57 per share, a 6% increase, which will begin with our September dividend payment. Thank you and I will now turn the program back to Wick. Wick Moorman : Thanks very much Marta. Well as you\u2019ve heard, we were obviously very pleased with our second quarter results. Clearly, there is still work to be done in terms of improving our network velocity and service levels and we\u2019ve a solid plan in place along with a great operating team to do just that. But even with that slower velocity, I\u2019m very proud of the way that our team kept our cost in check, even in the face of a volume surge, the magnitude at which, quite frankly none of us saw coming. Looking ahead, as you\u2019ve heard from Don while we still have some questions around coal and particularly export coal, we continue to see strong fundamentals in most of our businesses. Looking even more broadly we believe that the U.S. economy will continue to recover at a reasonable, although not robust level for the balance of this year and next, which would also help us to continue our upward momentum. There are some question marks on the regulatory front, most immediately concerning the transportation of crude oil, but I remain convinced that the U.S. rail system can transport crude oil safely and that the regulators understand and believe that as well and that they will not issue rules, which will seriously diminish our ability to do so. I\u2019ll close by repeating again our core strategy at Norfolk Southern, which is to focus on delivering superior transportation service to our customers in the most efficient and effective way possible at prices, which reflect the value of that service in the marketplace and thereby deliver superior returns to our share holders. We\u2019ve the franchise and the team to execute this strategy and our second quarter results also prove that we are on the right track. Thanks and I\u2019ll turn it over to the operator for your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Allison Landry - Credit Suisse : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Wick, I wanted to follow up on the last comment that you made with respect to crude by rail regulation. We\u2019ve recently been hearing some chatter actually that the DOT and PHMSA might put out, you know potentially even as soon as today or tomorrow, rules not only concerning the tank cars but also the speed limits and some of the numbers that we\u2019ve heard are a limit of 25 miles per hour. I know that the industry has talked about 40 being the lowest that you could do, but let's just say that the is scenario is 25. What happens and how would -- how would the industry respond? Would you stop moving crude altogether or substantially decrease what you\u2019re moving? Wick Moorman : Allison, it\u2019s a good question and we obviously do expect to see very shortly the regulators put out a notice of a proposed rule. There\u2019s a lot of speculation about what might be in that proposal, but there will then be the opportunity for all of us to discuss it before they come up with a final regulation -- and obviously speeds in the range that you mentioned, 25 0r 30 miles an hour would be extraordinarily disruptive to our rail network. Not only to trying to ship crude in which the exposure quite frankly would go up significantly because it would take a lot more trains and cars to move the same amount of oil, but it would be incredibly detrimental to the service in all of the rest of our business including Amtrak and including our auto business, our intermodal business, you name it and the resulting capacity loss I think is something that the rail network quite frankly could not manage. So we\u2019ve done a lot of modeling. We\u2019ve had a lot of discussion with the regulators and I believe that we\u2019ll be able to make our case that a minimum speed in the 40 to 45 mile an hour range is not only safe, which it is, but also is the range in which it will not be extraordinarily disruptive to the North American rail network. Allison Landry - Credit Suisse : Okay. So potentially we could see the -- the proposed rule come out with something more onerous than you guys would like but there is an opportunity to go back and revisit that. Wick Moorman : They\u2019re clearly in the process. It will be a proposal and there will be as I said a comment period and a period for the rail industry to present evidence and we\u2019ll have compelling evidence that any significant speed restriction would be in fact disruptive to the point of almost shutting down the North American rail network. Allison Landry - Credit Suisse : Okay, that\u2019s a great color and just a follow-up question, I guess turning to coal; is it safe to say that the rate concessions on the export side are largely behind us or should we expect further rate cuts just as prices continue to be weak globally and at what point does it become uneconomical to continue making these downward adjustments and maybe instead you start reallocating some resources elsewhere since you\u2019re seeing growth across the business. Don Seale : Good morning, Allison, this is Don. We believe as long as metallurgical coal prices in the world market remained in the 120 level and they\u2019ve been stable at the 120 level now for a couple of quarters, our export pricing is at the bottom and it's going to remain flat. In the third quarter based on that I will tell you thermal API-2 pricing in Western Europe has deteriorated further. We do not plan to try to follow that coal or incent that coal with transportation pricing because frankly the delta is too wide for us to make much of a difference in that market. Allison Landry - Credit Suisse : Okay. Great. Thank you so much for the time. Don Seale : Thank you, Allison. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Thomas Kim with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs : Good morning. Thank you. Can you elaborate on what your corporation growth was in the second quarter? Don Seale : We don\u2019t comment on what our core pricing results were. I will tell you that we\u2019re pleased to advise that it was in excess of our rail inflation rate and as we pointed out in the revenue per unit review in my remarks, we were pleased to see the results in our coal business with revenue per unit being up 5%. Our merchandise business up 2% and our intermodal business even with last year even though our international business volume was up 16%, double the domestic rate of growth, and as you know our domestic intermodal as a about a third higher revenue per unit than our international business based on international containers moving. So we were very pleased with our pricing results in the quarter. Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs : Okay. That\u2019s great. Thank you and then to what extent could you comment a little bit more about the coal pricing the domestic coal -- domestic utility coal versus the export side. Elaborate in terms of the trends we\u2019ve seen in the second quarter and particularly for the export coal. Don Seale : Our trend in export coal in the second quarter was essentially flat with the first quarter. As I mentioned in the previous question, we don\u2019t see that moving now, we\u2019re pretty much at the bottom of the market and we don\u2019t have plans for any appreciable movement downward in our export market rates at this point. In the utility market, I will tell you that most of our gain in RPU, revenue per unit, was attributed to longer haul coal that\u2019s originating in the Illinois basin and the Northern Appalachia Pittsburgh moving to our Southern utilities. That business was up 23% in the quarter and our business in the north was down 3%. So we had a very favorable extended haul result that drove our RPU and coal. Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs : That\u2019s great. Thank you very much. Don Seale : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott Group - Wolfe Research : Hey thanks. Good morning guys. So Don, just to follow-up on that last point about the coal yields, do you expect that mix of much better growth to southern utilities relative to north? Do you think that mix continues, is that a long term trend or is this something that\u2019s choppy and maybe not so sustainable? Don Seale : Good morning, Scott. It\u2019s a good question and we\u2019re seeing a continued conversion of utility coal from Central Appalachia with higher cost of production to the Illinois basin and to Northern Appalachia and I will share with you in the second quarter our origination percentages, we were 34% Central App, 31% Northern App. We were within 3% percentage points of Northern App now equaling Central App, which has been our traditional source of thermal coal, but the notable change was that the Illinois basin in the second quarter was now 19% of our thermal originations, which is three percentage points higher than the PRB originations coming to our network now at 16%. So we\u2019re seeing Illinois basin growth take place and we\u2019re certainly seeing Northern Appalachia growth take place both into the Southeast. We expect that trend to continue. Scott Group - Wolfe Research : And is there something about riots more going into the Southeast than the Northeastern that should continue? Don Seale : Well, the Southeastern stockpiles are at a level that they\u2019re being replenished coming off in the winter. We expect that replenishment to continue in the second half of 2014 and also higher natural gas prices have created a situation where thermal coal is dispatching at a higher rate in the South than it did this time last year. Scott Group - Wolfe Research : Okay, great. And then just second question, when we're hearing about adding more people but hopefully overtime and things like that and it should come down and service gets better net-net should that mix change, should that be good for operating margins and incremental margins in the back half of the year. You typically see earnings improve in the back half and just wondering should that continue this year? Marta Stewart : This is Marta. Scott, the overtime was about half and half occurred in the T&E and the non-T&E area. So the effect of the hiring that Mark described will reduce to moderate as the year goes on as these folks gets qualified. We'll reduce the T&E over time. We expect the non-T&E over time to continue right about this level through the end of the year. Wick Moorman : Yes, Scott. This is Wick. I would say too that overall we know and we've done a lot of analysis that tells us that as network velocity improves, our cost come out and our expectation is that over some period of time through the second half into next year as that network velocity increases even with the additional employees and T&E, our overall cost structure should benefit from it. Scott Group - Wolfe Research : Okay, so ultimately a good thing. Okay. All right, thanks a lot for the time guys. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Bill Greene of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley : Hi there. Good morning. Don, can I ask you to comment a little bit on some of the things you said in your preparatory marks, capacity we know is getting tighter. You mentioned that. It's getting tighter in the truck markets. We've seen that very clearly in a lot of data points. How soon is it before we have to start to see some higher pricing for the rails simply to handle this demand right to try to create if you will some elasticity which I know there is very little and along those lines, how much is service a limiter and what you can do on price? Don Seale : Good morning Bill. Let me take, I\u2019ll take the first part first, first part of the question first. We are seeing truckload capacity tighten. We have seen that trend take place now over the past 15 to 18 months. And it certainly is continuing to open up opportunities for us to improve our pricing for Intermodal where you know we still have a differential of 12% to 15% generally between Intermodal prices and truckload prices. That\u2019s -- a good example of that is what I mentioned in my remarks looking ahead of us taking a 4% increase on our originated business going West on transcontinental and a 3% increase effective September first on our local EMP business as well. And that's 17% of our domestic book of Intermodal, which I think is indicative. It illustrates the movement that's beginning to take place on pricing and Intermodal. We don\u2019t see any change or reversal in truckload capacity as long as the economic trends continue to move upward. And so we expect a more favorable pricing environment ahead and you will see us take more selective increases ahead with that. Now with respect to the second part on service. As Wick mentioned and as Mark mentioned, none of us are satisfied with our service levels at this point. We are working very closely with all of our customers to work through any concerns and the issues until we can get our service back to where we expected and where our customers expect it. But I\u2019ll tell you that with double-digit growth in most of our quarters including Crescent, Corridor and Heartland in the quarter service has not been an impediment to us handling our international business or continuing to have successful track record of converting highway freight to rail. Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley : Okay. Very good. Wick, can I ask you one another question. And that is you probably saw the BN agreement with Smart on possibly moving to one man cruise if ratified on areas where they have PTC in place. Do you think that this is a possible game changer for the industry? I know PTC is far from operable, but as we get there is there something we need to keep in the back of our minds? Wick Moorman : We certainly have seen that agreement. We are trying right now internally to work through all of the economics of that agreement to see what kind of impact something like that would have at Norfolk Southern. It's clearly a sea change agreement. But I think it\u2019s -- we're a long way from understanding how the economics play out and as you say its PTC contingent and our best guess right now on when PTC is actually operational across the entire North American rail network is approaching 2020. So is it interesting, yes. Could it be significant, yes? Does it have any immediate impact, I don\u2019t see that. Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley : Okay. That\u2019s great. Thank you for the time. Wick Moorman : Thanks Bill. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Maybe a question for you Mark on the velocity side just looking edge you move through the second quarter and clearly there was volume growth I should say coming out of the winter. But as you saw the quarter progress, it seems like some of those matrix may be deteriorate a little bit towards the end of the quarter. We've seen a recent bounce back here, but just want to get a rough sense of when we think we can start to see some more material improvement there and should we be focused on that? Is that something we need to be considering as we look for those matrics to improve and ultimately continue to drive what were very, very strong incremental margins in the quarter? Mark Manion : Yeah. Chris. Realistically as we go through the third quarter there is going to continue to be a lot of pressure on the operation. We see a lot of volume. Third quarter is always a robust quarter anyway and it looks like this one certainly is going to be. So we are going to stay up against it and we are not going to see additional cruise that are coming into the operation in the third quarter. We will start to see some -- we will put some additional locomotive power against it as we go into the third quarter. We are continuing as we have been -- we continue to march forward with improvements from additional infrastructure projects and they are very helpful. They have made a world a difference and we are certainly seeing that play up now. So we are going to hold our own, but we are not going to see a tremendous amount of improvement during the course of the third quarter. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I appreciate the color. And then Don just a follow-up on a question before, as you talked about the changing mix in southern utilities taking coal from different originations and ultimately have it playing out into the business. Can you just give us an update on where is southern and northern utility stock piles rest relative to historical or multiyear averages? Just want to get a rough sense of have we played this catch-up or how much is left to go until the second half of the year? Don Seale :  Chris. You may recall that back in the first quarter after we came through the so-called Polar Vortex Winter, we, at the end of our first quarter we shared a number of stock piles and our network had come down by about one third. We estimate now that we've worked off a portion of that reduction, but they are still down about 18% compared to December when we went into the weather and gas prices are still trending in an area of -- there are about 380, 390 Illinois Basin Coal, PRB Coal, and Northern App Coal will dispatch at those prices. So stock piles have not been replenished. There are still some work to be done and as long as gas prices are in the range that they are at today or higher, we will see utility coal demand in the south and hopefully in the north pick up as well. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup: Okay. And those stock piles are relatively balanced between northern and southern utilities. Don Seale : We see a little more opportunity right now in the south than we do the north, but I\u2019ll tell you that it's not much difference and as you know our utility volume is about 50-50 split between the north and the south. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks for the time I appreciate it. Don Seale :  Thanks Chris. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl of Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question. Jason Seidl - Cowen and Company : Good morning. gentleman. The first question is going to focus on the Intermodal side of things. Obviously we have seen you take some of the prices up on some of your book of business. But I think you mentioned it was 17% your domestic book. Can you talk to us about what percentages more of your domestic that you might be taking up in the near future, can you just do an across the Board tariff increase on some other segments of your business? Are there any larger contracts rolling over this year? Wick Moorman : No, we have contracts in place with intermodal and we cannot do an across the Board increase. What we'll have to do is time those increases when the contracts make available the opportunity to do that. Quite a bit of our business is priced year-to-year. So as we get through this calendar year, that will open up additional opportunities for our partners in the intermodal market to take up pricing as well. So this is a good start with our rail control containers, our EMP containers taking the 4% West transcon to 3% coming September 1st within local. You will see us take more, but it will be incrementally as contract open up and give us the opportunity to do that. Jason Seidl - Cowen and Company : So it seems like more of a 2015 event then. Wick Moorman : Yes, in those contracts I would point out that we do have escalators that apply until we get to the point where we can take a market based increase. Jason Seidl - Cowen and Company : Okay. And follow-up is related to crude by rail, when you're looking at sort of the safety statistics and I know that part of the focus on this release is going to be on some of the train speeds, but of the accidents that we've seen sort of across the rail networks that have been highly publicized, how many were actually due to excessive train speed? Wick Moorman : None to my knowledge. Wick Moorman : Okay. That's what I thought. Okay guys, those were my two. I appreciate the time as always. Wick Moorman : Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter of Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Ken Hoexter \u2013 Merrill Lynch : Great. Good morning. Congrats on pretty solid results and record operating ratio. Great to see that it continues. On the -- just a thought on, Mark on the capacity here, you're almost running at 2006 peak levels on a car load basis. You mentioned how much you are up or I guess year-over-year, so you mentioned your thoughts on your ability to recover velocity with employees and adding the crews on, what about CapEx? Do we need to -- do you need to increase that? Is this is a physical capacity that you're starting to bump up against or I guess can you talk about what your thoughts are and may be Don your thoughts on throwing it on the crescent and hotline if you're starting to see that ramp-up on the capacity there as well? Mark Manion : It has been very interesting to see how well we have digested the freight from -- the additional freight volume from an infrastructure standpoint and we just have not had bottleneck situations and like I commented some in the past on these calls, is the more than 10 years worth now of continual infrastructure improvement that just it takes place on an ongoing basis and there are a variety of projects that are loaded up in the pipeline and they keep coming out. We've got more that will be completed and more that will be started, this has. So we're trying to stay ahead of it and so far we are staying ahead of it. We've got our -- we've got our modeling and our capability based on traffic forecast to see where the next tight spots will be and that's when we put the infrastructure projects up against them and that process has been working well. So we're going to keep doing what we're doing and we got a major project, I think you are aware of coming out later this year, it will be in the fourth quarter when we have our Bellevue expansion that opens up and that is going to be very helpful to as far as lightening any capacity constraints up in our northern areas. So that's the way we're looking at it. Don Seale : Ken, I would add, this is Don. I would add to that when you look at the composition of our growth in the quarter for example out of our 145,000 loads, 95,000 units were intermodal and we've done a lot of work to densify our double stack-up operations, get the right box on the right car and that helps us manage capacity much more effectively. We're not adding trains in intermodal to handle the 95,000 additional units that we handled in the quarter. So that defecto is additional capacity and with respect to the quarters, the Crescent quarter I mentioned double-digit growth earlier, Crescent was up 11% in the quarter, Heartland was up 10%, Meridian was up 15% and because of what I just mentioned we're not -- we're not running into capacity issues at all in those quarters. As I had also mentioned in my remarks, we've made the investments over a multi-year period in those quarters with speed enhancements and terminal operations, new terminals and frankly we're positioned for growth and we're planning for growth. Ken Hoexter \u2013 Merrill Lynch : Great. Appreciate the insight and then secondly on your strong free cash flow, I guess two parts to that, one I guess we saw the dividend increase, why not more engaging on the share buyback given your large authorization and maybe Marta your thoughts on that. And then also I think Marta you mentioned your buying used locomotives, are there any available out there, given everybody is using surge capacity and does that mean maintenance could go up even higher I guess given these are the bottom of the barrel ones that are left in the market if they're not already been on the network? Marta Stewart : Well, with respect to the locomotives, yes, what I mentioned was that we've reallocated within the capital budget some of the funds towards used locomotives this year and our mechanical folks have inspected those and luckily we have the Juniata shop and they can refurbish those. So we feel that we're in a very good position to be able to acquire those and those are small pockets of locomotives here and there that our purchasing folks can find and mechanical folks inspect and know that we can repair adequately at Juniata. We already had -- before this reallocation, we already 75 new locomotives that we were buying this year 25 that come in and 50 will come in the back half of the year and that's why one of the reasons why our capital spending is backend loaded this year because those 50 will be coming in, in the last six months. So with respect to your free cash flow question, you're correct, we're having very strong free cash flow. We've talked about the increased dividend. We have the strong capital spending this year. We have been forecasting for the next two or three years, we're going to have heavy capital spending as we have some freight car purchases that are going to be timed in the next couple of years and so we feel that the share repurchase level that we have is appropriate given the free cash flow, given the capital that we feel is needed to reinvest in the system and which has good returns and really overlaying it all too is that the entire stock market is high and so we have in the past moderated our share repurchases when the stock markets is high. Ken Hoexter \u2013 Merrill Lynch : Thanks for the insight. Appreciate the time. Wick Moorman : Thanks Ken. Appreciate the kind words too. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Brandon Oglenski - Barclays: Well, good morning, everyone and congrats as well. Wick, can I just ask you -- we've seen several quarters now of pretty robust margin expansion I think driven by some pretty good cost outcomes, you're getting the growth outside of coal and I realize we still have some questions going forward in your coal markets, but I think the big issue for investors in your stock is can this company sustainably grow earnings even with a segment like coal down let's say in 2015 if that were the case? Do you feel like you have the confidence now, you are at a point where it doesn\u2019t necessarily matter what one commodity segment is doing on your network. You have a robust enough franchise now that you can maintain earnings momentum and margin expansion as long as the macro economies cooperating? Wick Moorman : I think the overall answer to that is certainly yes. We have some work to do as we've discussed extensively in terms of continuing to improve productivity and efficiency from the levels we're currently at. We're going to do that. I think that that's going to give us the ability to continue to drive more volume through the network in a very cost effective manner and give us strong operating margins -- operating leverage on that growth. I think the only caveat and you mentioned it as well is that we're going to have growth. We see strength in a lot of our businesses as we've all discussed and as Don has really kind of worked through the details with you. I think the only question mark about coal is it still is significant amount of our business and I know Brandon you\u2019re aware and everyone on the phone is of how much coal revenue we\u2019ve lost over the past two to three years. I guess in excess or at least to close to $1 billion over a two-year period. If we see stability in that market and there\u2019re certainly lots of signs particularly in the utility world that we are seeing stability now. I think we\u2019re poised to do very well. If something unforeseen comes along in the coal world or in the overall macro economy, then clearly we'll have challenges too, but given the conditions that we\u2019re seeing today, we continue to see -- have a very positive outlook for our company in the next -- certainly in the second half and I think in 2015 as well. Brandon Oglenski \u2013 Barclays: Well I appreciate that Wick and Don, maybe as a follow up, beyond intermodal because I know your thoughts about rate increases this summer, but are we -- because of the constraints that we\u2019re seeing across the system, not just at Norfolk, but it seems like some other carriers are at capacity as well on the rail side. Are we moving into a higher rate of price inflation for this industry? Don Seale : Brandon, we always price -- try to price to market and we think -- we think the truckload market will continue to tighten and that will support pricing with anything that\u2019s related to truckload activity. The rest of the business, we\u2019ll just have to stay tuned and see how the market moves. We\u2019re going to stay close to that market and we\u2019ll price to that and ensure that our yields meet our target of equaling or exceeding rail inflation going forward. Wick Moorman : Brandon let me say one other thing. I think that we talk about capacity in the transportation marketplace, but Don always points out that there\u2019s truckload capacity and that\u2019s one marketplace but you know we -- we have a very different set of dynamics in utility coal where the competition\u2019s not with the highway, it\u2019s more and more with gas and different coal souring. You look at the energy markets. The competition there has a very different set of factors, which aren\u2019t necessarily all driven just by what we see in the transportation marketplace. So every marketplace that we\u2019re in is different, has different dynamics and as Don always said we take that into account and try to price effectively in that particular marketplace. Brandon Oglenski \u2013 Barclays: Thank you. Don Seale : Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin of RBC. Please proceed with your question. Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets : Thanks very much. Just following up on that last question, we\u2019ve heard some of your competitors are now talking about -- more about yield management programs and in fact at -- coming up with tight capacity in the rail system and in fact looking at pruning some of the lower returning customers. Is that something that you foresee that perhaps without really rate increases per se but rather reallocating capacity to higher returning customers is that something that is new to your organization -- is it an opportunity that is emerging for Norfolk Southern? Is it something that you see playing out in the next -- next year or two? Don Seale : Good morning, Walter. This is Don. We plan to continue to improve our service product to serve all of our customers. We do not have plans to segment business that would deviate from that overall objective. So I would say that our commitment to our customers is very strong and that\u2019s to provide a good reliable service at a fair price. Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets : Okay. And second question here, I guess Wick you mentioned in your opening remarks that the first or the second quarter saw some volume that perhaps unsustainable for the rest of the year and I think lot of the questions today were -- were zeroing in on the fact that you typically do better in the third quarter than you do in the second. You had a very good quarter this second quarter. So I guess what I am trying to understand is, is there -- was there carryover volume from first quarter to second quarter that really helped you drive some good operating productivity that -- that probably won\u2019t carry into third as market indicated with some of the higher -- higher count, employee count or is there -- is the incremental margin here that you\u2019re getting on this volume steady through third quarter, that the seasonal pattern of you doing better in the third quarter than the second quarter can hold again here again this year? Wick Moorman : Well first of all in terms of first quarter carryover, we\u2019ve looked really hard at that question and quite frankly we -- as the second quarter went on we became more and more convinced that there was very little of that. There is some -- has been some pent-up demand in the automotive network with vehicles stored at assembly plants because of the slowdown of the North American rail network and car supply problems for the automotive industry, we\u2019ve had a big push on in the past three or four weeks and Mark and his team has done a great job on our network of bringing those numbers down significantly. I think of the tenure of remarks begin with is that we certainly didn\u2019t forecast an 8% year-over-year volume growth and we saw a lot of strength across a lot of businesses. We continue to see that strength, I was just I guess trying to temper my own enthusiasm and say I am not sure we\u2019re going to see the thirds quarter up 8% year-over-year or the fourth quarter we had a good second half last year but we do expect to see continuing strength in these businesses. Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets : Okay. Well, it was very much a good quarter. Congratulations. Thank you. Wick Moorman : Thank you so much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long of Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Justin Long - Stephens: Thanks and congrats on the quarter. I wanted to first follow up on an earlier question in intermodal, so intermodal growth has really started to accelerate. I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about how much runway you still have to add to train lengths? How long can the high single digit or low double digit intermodal volume growth continue without adding additional train starts? Don Seale : Mark, do you want to? Mark Manion : Yeah I\u2019ll -- let me -- let me just lead off with a comment about that Don, our intermodal train length is in the neighborhood of 6,000 feet and so when we look at the -- when we look at our high density corridors as far as where we handle intermodal, we can handle -- we can handle significantly more than 6,000 feet, 8,000 at a -- 8,000 at a minimum and in lot of cases we run over 10,000 feet. So there\u2019 still a lot of room to grow in that area. Justin Long - Stephens: Okay. Great. That\u2019s helpful and as a follow up, I was wondering in coal, do you have any major contracts in that business that are coming up for renewal over the next couple of quarters or so? Mark Manion : Justin, I will tell you that we have some opportunities that will be coming over the next three to three quarters and we\u2019re optimistic that those opportunities will bear fruit but we\u2019re not there yet. Justin Long - Stephens: Okay. Great. I\u2019ll leave it at that. Thanks for the time. Mark Manion : Thank you. Don Seale : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Larkin with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. John Larkin - Stifel: Hey, good morning and thank you for the taking the question. Mark, I think you mentioned that you\u2019re planning on adding roughly 900 new folks throughout the remainder of 2014 to bring the manpower level up to roughly where it was in 2013. Are all those people coming of furlough, do they need complete training, partial training. How long does it take to bring them up to speed and how expensive is that process? Mark Manion : We have earlier this year -- we began bringing people out of furlough. We were pretty successful in getting more people than usual to actually make some transfers from the location they were furloughed to other locations where they were needed. That process is complete and going forward the additional people we bring on or new hires that go through our training program and we will see -- we'll essentially see the first of those people coming out qualified in the fourth quarter. John Larkin - Stifel: Okay. Thank you. Perhaps another question on the reallocation that occurred in the capital budget maybe from Marta, it sounded as if some money was reallocated towards the purchase of used locomotives that could be remanufactured at Juniata and there were some bottleneck elimination projects perhaps in there as well. What projects did you draw that capital from and what was the thought process behind perhaps paring back the spending in that area? Marta Stewart : Well, some of those areas were naturally delayed frankly because of the weather in the first quarter. Our engineering forces were busy with the weather and so there was a little bit of when you schedule out there work for the rest of the year a little bit over \u2013 flopped over into 2015. So some of it occurred naturally, both in engineering and some of it also in the mechanical area. There was some car work that it\u2019s going to flop over into 2015. So the total amount that we reallocate was about $40 million. About two thirds of it used locomotives and about a third of it to very targeted, very specific locations that came out of that model Mark described. About very small pinch point, so the remainder of that is spread throughout the system in different places with sightings and that sort of thing. John Larkin - Stifel: Very good. Thank you again. Marta Stewart : Welcome. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Rob Salmon of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank : Hey good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Don, when I am thinking about the intermodal pricing opportunity you had highlighted, the 17% if I am thinking about that remaining 83%, I know you said basically over a full year the majority of that kind of comes up whether it\u2019s a rebid or it's just an escalator embedded in the contract. Can you give us a sense of what percentage is going to be re-pricing in the back half of this year with a new contract as opposed to an escalator? Don Seale : Rob, I will tell you that the EMP fleet, the rail owned or rail controlled containers that I referenced with respect to the increases we\u2019re taking locally and westbound, that will be most of the increases we\u2019re taking in intermodal for the second half unless we\u2019re taking an increase in an existing contract with an escalator that triggers quarterly or triggers annually within the second quarter. Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank : Okay. All right. That's helpful and then with regard to the Ag outlook I think your words were either strong or robust in terms of the back half of the year. How should we be thinking about that in terms of the third quarter and fourth quarter, because there are always their puts and takes with your network? Don Seale : Yeah, with respect to the third quarter, we\u2019ll see the new -- new crop start to come in in late August or early September. So we will be end of that time frame before you see it. We still see a lot of volume activity associated with the 2013 crop, which was strong as well. So we see opportunities ahead in corn and soybeans predominantly with this new crop. There\u2019s over 90 million acres of corn planted and over 80 million acres of soya beans planted and growing conditions are very good because they\u2019re getting the proper rainfall. So we expect export activity to be there and some other domestic opportunities as well. Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank : We should think about that rippling through your ethanol franchise as well I would imagine. Don Seale : Well the ethanol production, ethanol prices and ethanol demand continues to trend upward. So we see opportunity ahead for greater activity in ethanol and inbound corn for processing to make the ethanol. Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank : Thanks so much for the time. Don Seale : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Keith Schoonmaker of Morningstar. Please proceed with your question. Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar: Thanks. Good morning. Summarizing the data correctly it appears you improved RTM per fuel gallon pretty nicely over the prior year period, almost 5%. As we think about sustainability of the quarter\u2019s low operating ratio and the importance of fueling the cost structure, maybe you could comment is this an idiosyncratic period as far as fuel economy or is this just another data point on the overall improvement trend line. Wick Moorman : I think the way we would look at it and the way we do look at it is that it is just a data point on a trend line but it\u2019s a trend line that we expect to continue to get better over time. We have a lot of technology out there that we\u2019re employing to reduce fuel usage. That\u2019s ramping up nicely. We still have always to go with that the LEADER technology but it\u2019s employed across more and more the railroad and our goal is to drive on an average, the fuel usage per ton mile down. We\u2019re always going to see seasonal variations. We certainly saw that in the first quarter particularly with the very cold weather, you\u2019ve to leave these locomotives idling, you run short of trains and you do a lot of things but we think it\u2019s -- we think it\u2019s obviously this quarter is a good productivity improvement and we expect overall to see our fuel usage go down in the future as our technology gets better and better. Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar: Thanks and for second question, I would like to ask a little bit about the intermodal volume increase, I know it\u2019s a phenomenon that probably occurred later in the quarter but could you comment on what portion of the volume increase you believe resulted from customers concerned with West Coast disruption risk? And related to that does the summer\u2019s intermodal volume trend give any insight into your expectations concerning volume that may result from the completion of Panama Canal project. Thanks. Don Seale : We have difficulty identifying the portion of the 16% increase in international that was directly attributable to the ILWU contract negotiation. We know it was present. We\u2019ve been told by customers that they were making some secondary arrangements for contingency plans. So part of our increase of that 16% we know came from that. But frankly we\u2019ve also been seeing an ongoing trend of conversion of international shipments in our network from the West Coast ports to East Coast ports of entry with all water services. So we know that\u2019s a part of it. Plus I have to remind you too that the Inland port that we opened in partnership with the Port of Charleston had a very good quarter. That\u2019s -- that's in that higher number plus we had a couple of new accounts in that quarter as well. So it\u2019s the combination of all of those things. Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar: Okay. Any insight on Panama yet or too early? Don Seale : You know the Panama Canal -- our view and -- and of course our view is going to be basically predicated by what our customers decide to do and our customers are the steamship lines and the beneficial cargo launders that are working with the steamship lines but they\u2019re telling us that they don\u2019t see at this point in time a pronounced impact when the canal opens most likely now in 2016 because of so much activity that\u2019s already beginning to take place through the Suez Canal with larger vessels coming to the East Coast ports and as the freight originations in Asia continue to shift away from China and go southward toward Malaysia and Vietnam etc. So we\u2019re being told at this point not to expect a significant shift in business when the canal opens. We just have to wait and see and of course we\u2019re staying close to our customers who will make the ultimate decision of how they want to move their cargos. Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar: Great. Thank you for the comments. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman of Buckingham Research. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham Research : Thank you very much and thank you for taking my question. Congratulations, the quarter looked fantastic. Marta, I want to come back to the question Ken Hoexter asked on cash flow. I heard what you said, you have the debt coming up in September, I think it\u2019s about $430 million give or take. I guess the question I have is you -- your cash balances are up almost $1 billion from where they were a year ago working capital is the whole increase has been cash. Even with the higher level of capital spend and some of the projects coming on and the debt payout you still look to be cash flow neutral. I hear you that the stock's up a lot with the market but is there a better use ultimately the reason to have a $5 billion, $6 billion of cash sitting on the books. Marta Stewart : Well we don\u2019t believe -- we do have that now, you\u2019re correct. We don\u2019t believe we\u2019re going to end the year at that. As you\u2019ve pointed out we\u2019ve that $430 million debt maturity in September and we now currently plan to pay that off. So that\u2019s going to be a use of the cash and also as I explained earlier we have higher CapEx in the second half of the year so we do not expect to end the year at this high at the cash level. Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham Research : To be even with all that it -- it's still looks like you\u2019re going to finish close to $1 billion, $2 billion, $3 billion I mean that is above the normal amount of cash you hold. Is there like a 2015 project that you\u2019re thinking about? Marta Stewart : Well, you\u2019re correct that that\u2019s above of what our historical norm, where we run cash. 2015 will have the heavy CapEx. We also hope that it\u2019s going to have the very strong free cash flow, which will support that. And so I think what we are trying to do is just maintain our discipline, keep an eye on the market and be ready to take advantage of any volatility that arises. Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham Research : Okay. Thank you very much. Don Seale : Thank you, too. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Donald Broughton of Avondale Partners. Please proceed with your question. Donald Broughton - Avondale Partners :  Thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to kind of strategically get your outlook on this -- both UNCX certainly seen strong demand at least in your system in the short term you\u2019ve proven to be much more resilient then they have. After reporting a multi quarter performances of high volumes, lower headcount, I am hearing a prediction of higher overtime in the second half, but you also have strong safety performances. So when you look into this you look as this is an opportunity to further leverage your assets and infrastructure with existing headcount or just slightly higher or do you think there is a greater opportunity and just materially growing the headcount and using the services disparity to gain real volume real market share? Wick Moorman : Well, Don that's excellent question. The one correction or clarification I would make is what I think we expect in terms of overtime is just to see overtime rates year-over-year certainly in the third quarter dollars continue to be higher, but that I will also point out is in the contrast to in 2012 and 2013 we drove overtime way down compared to prior year. So we think we have the capability we will do that again. I think it goes back to what Don talked about is that we have done a lot of analysis across our rail road, which has really proved to us that maintaining a high network velocity albeit it may take more resources in some way. It's certainly going to require some more crews as Mark pointed out, ultimately gives us a lower cost structure, total cost structure, and more efficient operation and in addition it gives customers the service that we want to give them. So when we see our network running at the levels that it is today, we know it's still efficient and you\u2019ve seen the numbers and we think that we need to still bring on the resources, drive the velocity up, give the customers at services that's going to give Don and his folks more ability to go out and get more business. It's going to go out, allow them to go out and charge their prices in the marketplace for that, and it's going to give us a better cost structure. And Mark reminds me that we said at the beginning of the year that we had a number of productivity improvements underway and that we estimate that it is the time that that would take about $100 million out of our cost structure and we still think we are going to achieve that number this year. So we think we got a good strategy, but it's a service and velocity based strategy and it's paid off for us in the past and it will continue to pay off for us. Donald Broughton - Avondale Partners :  So your comments about overtime are really more of a reflex back towards what's more normal after making the kind of significant productivity and velocity gains you posted recently is what you are trying to say if I hear you right? Marta Stewart :  The overtime that we think we are going to have for the rest of year is very targeted where we think it's going to occur. So let's split it into the two things. On the T&E side, which is about half of it we think because of the need to train these people it's one of the other people ask about, those are not going to be qualified until the fourth quarter many of those new people. And so we don\u2019t expect the T&E overtime to decline until the fourth quarter, but we do expect to decline. On the other side is our shop employee generally speaking and most of that has been incurred on the taking care of the older and now be used locomotive. So on that side, we are not projecting to significantly ramp up the number of employees because that is more of a shorter term in nature. Donald Broughton - Avondale Partners :  Simple. Marta Stewart :  Exactly. Donald Broughton - Avondale Partners :  That makes it much, much more sense. Thank you, Marta Stewart :  So that portion of the workforce will be -- will fade most over time, but the T&E will work itself back to stray time as the people get qualified. Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham Research : Thank you. And I look forward to seeing you next week. Wick Moorman : Thank you. Look forward to it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question. David Vernon - Sanford Bernstein : Thanks for taking the question. Marta, just to kind of step back from the short term use of the cash and think more about the longer term, you mentioned the step-up in equipment power placement, is that something that you think could push the capital spending above that 18% to 19% of sales that we've been seeing in the last couple years? Marta Stewart : For that, that 18% to 19% of revenue is an elevated level for us. I think we've signaled in last -- within the last year that we think we're going to stay at that elevated level for at least two more years, largely because of the power placement needs and longer term and of course PTC is elevating that too. So right now, trailing 12 months we're at -- our 2.2 is at 19%, 2% of that PTC. So when you back that out and get 17% and when you get past the next two years, we are targeting after that to get back more in the historical range of 16%, 17% of revenue. David Vernon - Sanford Bernstein : And given Wick's comments around PTC, maybe extending into 2020 with that 2% kind of continue to linger or is this going to be more front end loaded? Marta Stewart : That we'll have to see how that plays out. David Vernon - Sanford Bernstein : All right. Thanks, and maybe just as a quick follow-up on intermodal Don, you mentioned the escalators that are in the contract, would you have expected them to maybe deliver a little bit more on the wholesale contracts from a pricing perspective given the spike in truck rates or can you talk a little bit about how that lag or mechanism should work so they are being trying to gauge the opportunity going forward? Don Seale : The escalators in our intermodal contracts would be more correlated to the rail cost adjustment factors all inclusive plus steel, which is an independent factor from motor carrier cost. So those escalators are not tied to truck load pricing in general. David Vernon - Sanford Bernstein : So you haven\u2019t tied the intermodal pricing to your wholesale or to your retailers to the truck rate? Don Seale : No, we do not in general. David Vernon - Sanford Bernstein : All right. Thanks that's my follow-up. Appreciate the time. Don Seale : Thank you. Wick Moorman :  Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our final question is coming from the line of Cleo Zagrean of Macquarie. Please proceed with your question. Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Group : Good morning and thank you. In the opening remarks you mentioned that you were looking to price equal or above rail inflation. Can you help us understand how you think about pricing portfolio, how managed portfolio on pricing versus margins and this is where you were only able to price in line with inflation benefitting from more slag capacity such that margins had returns across the portfolio or even would appreciate any insight into that. Wick Moorman :  Cleo, good morning. With respect to our pricing philosophy again, we look at the market segments and we try to maintain a direct correlation with our yield management plan and the various market segments that we're participating in and that runs the range of conditions from truck load capacity to barge capacity, conditions in barges, the availability of barges to a lesser degree than truck load and then rail to rail competition. And then of course we always have an ongoing change in the mix of our business. So when you're looking at revenue per unit of our book, it will be an ongoing change in that book, based on things like the longer haul of coal that's taking place today and utility coal, the fact that for example in this quarter, we had no liquidated damages on coal, so the revenue of coal has no LVs in that. So does that get the essence of your question? Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Group : I guess I was trying to make sure that we keep our eyes on the right metric in terms of the bottom line and do not get overly concerned if some mix issues at the topline could point to a deterioration. Is there any reason of concern to you that in some pockets you are only pricing in line with inflation versus say may be trying to price consistently above? Wick Moorman :  You're making a very good point and we look at the overall margin and incremental margin on the business, the book taking into account the price mix and we're not -- we don't become concerned with mix changes. They are what they are and we manage through that and that doesn\u2019t impact also the yield management or pricing plan. Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Group : Thank you. And my follow-up is also with regards to a comment you made in the opening remarks that from the experience so far this year, you have learned about new ways to adjust your resources to respond to changes in demand. Can you help us understand whether some of the changes that you are making should help with the long term progression in margins once we're out of this congestion and you benefit -- sustainable benefit from the changes in the network and investments that you're making spurred by this experience that maybe would lift your long term efficiency goals or bring them sooner. Thank you. Wick Moorman :  Obviously, any time we not only experience high volume growth quarter like this one, but certainly the quarter like the first quarter with the network disruptions across the North American rail network that we've seen, we try to go back and see what learnings we can take from them. I think to Mark's point about -- we have to think again about quite an ancient service resources and how we are able to respond to unanticipated growth. We're going to go back and I think learn some lessons from that and I think what you will see as a result is that over some period of time, we will become more efficient because when we see something like the situation we've had in the second quarter, we'll able to react more effectively to it and hopefully not lose network velocity or see increased over time because we'll have responded with the resources in a more flexible way. But there is a lot of learning to be had out of all of these experiences and we're always looking at what has happened and trying to improve ourselves as a result. Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Group : Thank you very much. Wick Moorman :  Thank you. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I'll turn the floor back over to Wick Moorman for closing comments. Wick Moorman : Well, thank you everyone for your patience and your questions and we look forward to talking to you all again at the end of the third quarter. Operator Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And thank you for your participation.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Katie Cook, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Ms. Cook. You may now begin. Katie Cook - Director, Investor Relations : Thank you, Rob and good morning. Before we begin today\u2019s call, I would like to mention a few items. First, the slides of the presenters are available on our website at norfolksouthern.com in the Investors section. Additionally, transcripts and downloads of today\u2019s call will be posted on our website. Please be advised that during this call we may make certain forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially from those projected. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. Additionally, keep in mind that all references to reported results, excluding certain adjustments that is, non-GAAP numbers have been reconciled on our website in the Investors section. Now, it is my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Wick Moorman. Wick Moorman - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Katie and good morning everyone. It is my pleasure to welcome you to our third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. With me today are several members of our senior team, including our President, Jim Squires; our Chief Marketing Officer, Don Seale; our Chief Operating Officer, Mark Manion; and our Chief Financial Officer, Marta Stewart. I am pleased to report that Norfolk Southern achieved another very good quarter as third quarter financial results set records across the board. Earnings for the quarter were $1.79 per share, up 17% compared with the $1.53 we earned during third quarter last year. These strong results reflect continued high demand in most of our business groups as overall volumes increased 8% driven by double-digit increases in merchandise and intermodal offset by a slight decline in coal. For the second consecutive quarter, revenue topped $3 billion, up $199 million or 7% versus last year. And Don will fill you in on the revenue and volume details in a few minutes. Similar to our second quarter results, our expenses were up only 3% and our resulting 67.0% operating ratio set a third quarter record. Now, while our financial results were very strong much like in the second quarter, the railroads velocity and operating metrics were considerably reduced year-over-year as we continue to be challenged by demand in excess of our forecast for the year. This was particularly significant in terms of our crew base, which was sized for lower volumes. As all of you know, it takes from 7 to 9 months to hire and qualify new transportation employees. And we are just now starting to see newly qualified conductors marking up in our critical areas. We continue to actively hire and have taken steps to accelerate our training cycle. In addition, we have temporarily transferred over 100 train and engine service personnel to our busy Dearborn division from other parts of the network. We have the other special initiatives in place as well to help increase crew availability and we have a number of important infrastructure projects and new locomotives coming online in the fourth quarter as well. Mark will go over our service metrics and our initiatives for improvement in more detail with you. While we have demonstrated our ability to successfully manage overall expenses, the network slowdown and recovery efforts have translated to some additional operating costs and Marta will go over all of them as well as the rest of the financials. In spite of these operating challenges, we are excited about delivering another quarter of record results and we remain optimistic about our prospects going forward. And on that note, I will turn the program over to Don, then Mark, and then finally Marta, and then I will return with some closing comments before we take your questions. Don? Don Seale - Chief Marketing Officer : Thanks, Wick and good morning everyone. As Wick stated, we are pleased to report that the third quarter of 2014 was our second consecutive $3 billion quarter with record revenues in both our merchandise and intermodal sectors, which were partially offset by a weaker coal market. Revenue growth of $199 million, up 7% versus third quarter of last year was generated by our merchandise business, which generated a $152 million, up 10% followed by intermodal, which was up $62 million or 10% over last year. In coal, weak global market conditions in the export sector and milder summer weather, which impacted coal demand, resulted in a decline of $15 million or 2% compared to third quarter of last year. Volume increases in intermodal and merchandise accounted for $219 million of revenue variance in the quarter. Also positive year-over-year fuel surcharge revenue partially offset the negative mix effects associated with higher intermodal volumes and lower coal shipments. Accordingly, total RPU was down 1% in the quarter as a result of this negative mix effect between and within our business groups, which I will discuss in more detail as I review each of the major business groups. Now, turning to the components of growth, total volume increased 8% due to 10% gains in merchandise and intermodal shipments, which offset a 2% decline in coal. Across our merchandise business, very strong performance was led by increased chemicals, automotive and metals and construction volumes. In intermodal for the first time shipments exceeded 1 million units in the quarter, a gain of almost 92,000 units, up 10% compared with third quarter 2013 with strength in both domestic and international markets. And in coal, volume declined by 2% as export shipments weakened due to continued global oversupply and sluggish demand. Now, moving to our individual market segments, starting with coal, coal revenue was down $15 million or 2% compared to third quarter last year. Coal revenue per unit was flat in the quarter as declines in higher yielding export traffic offset the positive effects of increased longer haul traffic to our Southern utilities. With respect to utility coal, overall volumes declined by 3% as a result of milder summer temperatures with July in particular posting the lowest average temperature since 2009. Lower natural gas prices also impacted coal burn during the quarter. This factor along with a competitive contract loss resulted in a 14% decline in shipments to our northern utility plants, while volume to southern plants was up 9%. In the export market, third quarter volumes were down 16% as excess global supply and lower commodity pricing continued to impact the seaboard and coal market causing declines in both metallurgical and thermal coal volumes at our Lambert\u2019s Point terminal. Within our domestic metallurgical markets, volumes were up 8% led by gains in coke shipments to the steel industry, which more than offset weaker domestic met coal volumes. And finally, industrial coal volumes increased by 32% due to new business and organic growth with industrial customers as the economy continues to improve. Turning to intermodal, intermodal revenue in the quarter increased by $62 million or 10% to $667 million, which is a new quarterly record. With respect to revenue per unit, positive pricing activity within the domestic intermodal segment was offset by higher volumes of lower revenue per unit international freight leading to overall flat yield per shipment. Domestic intermodal volume was up 8% driven by targeted highway conversions across all business segments as well as organic growth with large key accounts across our domestic book of business. On the international side, strong volume growth of 15% was generated through organic growth with our existing shipping partners, new contract business and from new terminal growth. Moving to our merchandise markets, these five carload business groups also set a new quarterly record with $1.7 billion in revenue, an increase of $152 million or 10% versus third quarter of 2013. Our merchandise markets also faced negative mix effects as strong volume growth within our metals, construction, and bi-level automotive segments offset gains in higher revenue per unit, agricultural and chemical commodities. As a result, overall merchandise RPU declined by $7 and was flat for the quarter. With respect to volumes, growth was led by strong increases in crude by rail and natural gas liquids, which increased our chemicals volume by 17%. Automotive volumes were up 12% versus last year propelled by significant increases as we took advantage of the auto manufacturers\u2019 summer shutdown period in July to reduce finished vehicle inventory backlogs that were a result of national car \u2013 railcar supply issues incurred earlier in the year. And growth in frac sand, aggregates and steel increased our metals and construction carloads by a strong 12%. And the excellent 2013 corn crop continue to provide growth opportunities in our agricultural market helping to generate a volume gain of 6% in the quarter. Finally, paper and forest products volumes were flat in the quarter with double-digit gains in lumber offsetting declines in kaolin clay and waste shipments. Now, I will conclude with our business outlook. We see continued opportunity ahead to generate solid growth across most of our business units. The exception is coal. So far this year, our utility coal shipments have been higher than expected due to elevated natural gas prices and the need to replenish stock piles. But the impact of milder weather and lower natural gas prices are now reversing some of that positive trend. On the plus side, we estimate that stock piles at our utilities remain 19% below December 2013 levels going into the winter heating season. So the wildcard is what kind of winter demand lies ahead. In our met and thermal export markets, we continued to see global oversupply and low commodity pricing. And the weaker Australian dollar which has declined another 6% since September 1 is making Australian coal even more competitive in the global marketplace. Turning to intermodal, tightening capacity and rising cost in the trucking industry will drive continued volume growth in our domestic markets as we take advantage of opportunities the highway conversion and yield improvement. And we expect continued growth in our international intermodal business through organic growth and new services. In our merchandise markets, we anticipate continued opportunities in crude oil and natural gas related products as well as drilling material such as frac sand and pipe. We also anticipate higher steel volumes to support the energy and automotive sectors, while housing expansion will help boost volumes in aggregates, lumber and construction materials. In the automotive sector, volumes are expected to move higher with increased vehicle production and with new models coming online at several Norfolk Southern served assembly plants. Last, in our agricultural markets, expectations for another record corn and soybean harvest in 2014 will lead to domestic growth, as well as potential export opportunities in the months ahead. Now, let me summarize, we expect revenue and volume growth in our intermodal and merchandise markets, while we continued to face challenging and uncertain conditions in the coal sector. As we move forward, we remain keenly focused on improving service to meet the expectations of our customers and to support our ability to price to market at levels that equal or exceed rail inflation. In turn, we will continue to invest in equipment, locomotives and our network to provide better service today and in the future for our customers. Thanks for your attention. And I will now turn it over to Mark for our operating report. Mark? Mark Manion - Chief Operating Officer : Thank you, Don. Third quarter operations were heavily impacted by very positive traffic growth. While we continue to target overall operating efficiency, network velocity and service performance have slipped. Initiatives to balance and effectively apply resources to those segments of a network that are seeing the most growth are stabilizing the operation and customers should start to notice improvements in service and service consistency during the fourth quarter. More importantly, these efforts will position us for further growth going into 2015. On Slide 2, our nine months injury ratio stands at 1.18, down slightly when compared to last year. But we have been seeing improving trends continuing into the third quarter, which had an injury ratio of 1.09. Train incidents for the first nine months are flat compared to the full year in 2013 at 2.4 per million train miles. Crossing accidents increased to 4.0 per million train miles for the first nine months compared to 3.6 for the full year 2013. As I noted on my opening slide, service levels have been impacted by volume increases and particularly traffic increases across the corridor from Chicago to Philadelphia. Consequently, as you see on Slide 3, our composite service performance dropped to 68.6% in the third quarter, well below customer expectations and the record service level of 2013. Moving to Slide 4, as you would expect, train speed and terminal dwell data show the same trend as the service composite, reflecting slower network velocity. Train speed averaged 20.9 miles per hour in the third quarter and terminal dwell was 24.7 hours. Both were impacted by volume as we have discussed, but there were also a number of track works and PTC projects across parts of the Northern region. These will be completed ahead of seasonal peaks in grain and intermodal. We have and we will continue to take additional steps that will bring measurable improvements to network velocity and service delivery. Some of these initiatives are outlined on Slide 5. Aligning and positioning T&E forces with volume growth is our immediate focus. To address crew availability in the short-term, we have offered various temporary incentives to our current T&E employees. 114 conductors and engineers agreed to transfer temporarily from various parts of the network to locations on the Northern region where volume growth has outpaced crew availability. In addition, over 680 employees participated in a vacation buyback program. And we have also offered incentives to T&E employees who were eligible to retire, but defer retirement until 2015. As discussed in my remarks regarding second quarter operating results, we stepped up hiring and training in order to bring T&E forces in line with expected volumes. Currently we have 1,453 new T&E employees in various stages of the hiring, training and qualification process. In the third quarter, 206 new conductors were qualified and most of those were placed in the high traffic growth areas along the Chicago to Philadelphia corridor. In the fourth quarter, we expect that 596 will be qualified. At the beginning of this year, we had 11,290 T&E employees in active or training status. By the end of this year that number is expected to increase to 12,006, which is a net increase of 716 T&E employees this year. Several new infrastructure projects in the Chicago area and Upper Midwest have or shortly will be completed, adding more capacity and more flexibility in our operations in and around the Chicago area. Perhaps the most important of these is the expansion of the terminal in Bellevue, Ohio. This project which nearly doubles the capacity of the terminal will ramp up in December. We will then begin a phased-in operating plan with full operations at Bellevue online during the first quarter of 2015. In addition to more capacity, the Bellevue expansion will give us much more flexibility in routing of trains to and from Chicago and more bypass options during periods of bad weather. Now while Bellevue is the largest infrastructure project, other infrastructure projects are certainly worthy of noting. The Englewood Flyover in Chicago completed just this month, separates NS operations from metro trains through Chicago and has significantly improved fluidity of our operation there. The new 51st Street connection near our intermodal facility at Chicago will be completed early next year. When completed, the new connection will improve train operations and reduce time and handling for trains moving in and out of that facility. Our new connection at Goshen, Indiana will also be completed after the 1st of the year. It provides a direct link from our terminal at Elkhart to the Mariana, Ohio branch for more fluid operations and greater flexibility of operations around one of the largest terminals. And six new receiving tracks at our convoy terminal in Pittsburgh will be in service by the end of the year. This new capacity will improve service in this rapidly growing corridor that includes new crude by rail volume. Finally, in terms of locomotives, we will be taking delivery of 50 new EMVs, SD70ACe units beginning this month. In addition, we recently reached an agreement to purchase 100 SD90MAC units and start taking \u2013 started taking delivery of those units in September. We expect to take delivery of 40 of these units by the end of the year. With these, the number of units available for services reached historic highs in line with historically high volumes. Together with aligning our T&E forces for expected demand, these projects for additional capacity and growth in our locomotive fleet gave us a very strong position moving into the fourth quarter and 2015. Moving to the next slide, with volume increase of 8% in the third quarter, crew starts, including re-crews, increased by 2%. This margin of difference is due in part to improving operating efficiencies, but also reflects efforts to conserve available crews through train combinations and train annulments. We would still see very positive margin even with a more robust crew base. Our current crew base continues to be stretched, which is reflected in higher overtime hours, up 32% for the third quarter compared with the same period last year. With hiring and other steps I have outlined, network velocity is expected to improve as we move into the fourth quarter and we expect to see that reflected in further improvements in operating efficiencies, particularly reductions in overtime. That trend should continue into 2015 when we expect that our crew base will be fully aligned with expected volumes. A 1% improvement in carloads per locomotive reflects our ability to absorb higher volume with existing train operation. And fuel utilization was also favorable as gallons per 1,000 gross ton miles declined by 4% compared to the same period last year. Thank you. And now, Marta, I will turn it over to you. Marta Stewart - Chief Financial Officer : Alright. Thank you, Mark and good morning everyone. Let\u2019s get started with the summary of our operating results on Slide 2. Revenues exceeded $3 billion, up $199 million or 7% driven as Don mentioned by double-digit volume gains in intermodal and merchandise. Operating expenses increased only $50 million or 3% resulting in a third quarter record operating ratio of 67%. Slide 3 shows the major components of the $50 million net increase in railway operating expenses, which you know were almost entirely concentrated in the materials and other category. Now, let\u2019s take a closer look at each expense categories beginning with materials and other on Slide 4. This line item increased by $45 million or 23%. As in the second quarter, the largest reason was significantly higher usage of locomotive materials, which was up almost $20 million. As Mark discussed, we have all our surge fleet locomotives deployed and total units in service are near historical highs. Also contributing to the rise in this category were higher casualty claims accruals and higher loss and damage costs. The relative increase in claims accruals was a result of favorable adjustments last year. The increased lading damage costs were due to two derailments during this quarter, which damaged finished vehicles and totaled $10 million. For the fourth quarter, we continued to expect a high rate of locomotive material usage and we also faced an unfavorable comparison in casualty claims accruals relative to last year. Turning to Slide 5, purchased services and rents were up $9 million or 2% largely due to higher volume-related activities, particularly in the areas of intermodal ops, equipment rents, and joint facilities. Next, depreciation expense for the quarter rose by $6 million or 3% reflective of our larger capital base. We expect a similar increase in the fourth quarter. As shown on Slide 7, fuel expense decreased by a net of $3 million or 1%. The 2014 third quarter average diesel fuel price of $2.96 per gallon was the first sub $3 quarterly average in more than 3 years. This lower price accounted for a $21 million reduction, while higher consumption increased fuel expense by $16 million. As Mark noted, this is only a 4% consumption increase on an 8% rise in traffic. Slide 8 details the $7 million or 1% decline in compensation and benefit cost. As discussed in prior quarters, continued favorability and post-retirement medical and pension accruals coupled with slightly lower health and welfare costs resulted in a $44 million reduction in expense. Partly offsetting this decline were increased pay rates of $16 million, higher incentive compensation of $12 million, and $10 million more in over time. With the exception of incentive comp, we expect these variances to continue at similar levels in the fourth quarter. Turning to our non-operating items, other income net was up $2 million on higher property sales and interest expense on debt was up $7 million related to last year\u2019s debt issuance. Slide 10 depicts our income tax accruals and the effective rates. Total taxes were $333 million, up $67 million largely due to higher free tax earnings. The effective tax rate was 37.3% compared to 35.6% last year, which had the benefits from a state tax decrease and tax credit. Slide 11 displays our net income and EPS comparisons, which were both third quarter records. Net income of $559 million was up $77 million or 16% and diluted earnings per share, was $1.79, up $0.26 or 17%. Wrapping up our financial overview on Slide 12, cash from operations for the first nine months totaled $2.3 billion covering capital spending and producing nearly $1 billion in free cash flow. We distributed $511 million in dividends and $166 million in share repurchases. Thank you. And I will now turn the program back to Wick. Wick Moorman - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Marta. Well, as you have heard, it was another very good quarter for Norfolk Southern. However, as good as these results are, it\u2019s clear that they could have been even better, if we have been able to achieve the network velocities in line with our performance for the prior two years. And not only did these operating issues have an impact on our financial performance, more importantly, they kept us from delivering transportation services to our customers at the level that they have come to expect from our company. For that reason, we are very focused on getting back to the service metrics that we have posted in the prior two years as quickly as we can and then improving further from there. Mark outlined some of the steps that we are taking. And while it will take a little time to reach our 2012/2013 velocities, we are very confident that we are on the right path and that the infrastructure and resources that we are adding will set the stage for us to grow volumes and provide even better service in the future. We have a great team at Norfolk Southern. And I have every confidence in our ability to continue to provide outstanding service to our customers and outstanding results for our shareholders. Thanks for your attention. And I will turn it back to the operator for your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question. Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley : Yes, hi there. Good morning. Wick or Mark, I wanted to talk a little bit further on the service issues, is it just as simple as adding locomotives and employees, is it really a resource constraint? I am sure you are aware of the other argument that M&A is a solution there. So, can you sort of talk about what leverage you can pull on? How you sort of see this? Mark Manion : Yes. I am sure Wick will talk about the M&A side of it. In priority order for us, it\u2019s a crew issue. I mean, the reality is you need a sufficient number of crews in order to handling your volume. And our volume just outpaced the crew. So, as I have said, we are ramping those up and we start to turn those crews on Bill in a bigger way in November and December and that will be very helpful. But we are already seeing improvement from those temporary folks that I spoke of that went to our Northern region. Now, in addition to crews and as far as locomotives go, I mean the reality is we have got enough locomotives right now, but when you get into a lower velocity situation that eats up your locomotives, so you get to the point where you can\u2019t hardly have enough. So, it will be helpful to have these additional locomotives coming on and they already are coming on. So, that will be good. Now, another important factor here is these infrastructure projects. As businesses ramped, these projects and I won\u2019t go through them again, I mentioned them they will be no one project by itself fixes it, but you combine those projects particularly with our Bellevue infrastructure project that just plant gives you more capacity. And that\u2019s the sort of thing that from a standpoint of being sustainable and allowing for more growth going forward, that\u2019s what those infrastructure projects get you. So, we are really looking forward to that. And then the last thing I would mention is that we have been doing a lot to find some routes around Chicago. And just one, for example, as we have got aligned, it\u2019s immediately south of Chicago, we refer to it as our Streator line and we are taking a hard look at what we are actually starting to use that in a greater way for more interchange of traffic, but we are even looking at increasing our infrastructure on that route in the short-term. So, those are the kind of things that bulk you up to be able to handle more traffic and operate more effectively than we currently are. Wick? Wick Moorman : Well, I will say too that the problems that we are experiencing are not unique to Norfolk Southern there are lot of issues across the industry, which are well documented and everyone is talking frankly about them. That does have some impact on us, certainly the Chicago Gateway has been congested and erratic over the past number of months, but all the carriers are trying to address that and I think that collectively we are all taking the right steps to address that. The simple fact about Chicago is that, there is an enormous amount of rail infrastructure from both the east and the west that just points that way. That\u2019s where a lot of railroad capacity meets. And we are always going to do a lot of business through Chicago. We \u2013 and there are lots of different opinions about it, but we are looking bilaterally and as Mark mentioned with other carriers in terms of thinking about alternative locations, when that\u2019s possible, but it\u2019s not always possible for a number of reasons. And the other thing I will say is that we have seen very positive impact over the past two years in Chicago from CREATE. It has opened up a lot of real congestion points for us, former congestion points and not just CREATE but projects like the Englewood Flyover, which effectively gave us 6 to 8 hours more access to our mainline everyday are really important. So, every franchise is different, Bill, as you know, but when we look at the issues that we are facing \u2013 have been facing and we do the analysis and we have done a lot of analysis. It comes right back to what Mark would say. Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley : Let me ask one follow-up to this and if I missed this in your prepared remarks, I apologize, but have you quantified what the service challenges have cost this year or maybe even include weather. Just so we have a sense for look there is this much embedded in the cost structure this year that if it goes according to plan won\u2019t be there next year? Marta Stewart : Well, in the third quarter, it is difficult Bill. This is Marta. It is difficult, Bill to kind of tease it apart from the volumetric increase, but generally speaking, rough numbers you can assume that most of the increase in over time, which this quarter was $10 million and last quarter was a similar amount. Most of the increase in over time is related to that. And I say that the other biggest item would be the increased locomotive materials, because Mark\u2019s folks have had to fix the heavy bad order locomotives. And so I would estimate for this quarter you take all of the over time at $10 million somewhere between 0.5 to 3 quarters up to $20 million increased locomotive materials and that would be about the impact the service had on our expenses. Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley : Okay, fair enough. Thank you for the time. Wick Moorman : Thanks, Bill. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Allison Landry - Credit Suisse : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, in spite of the service issues in the third quarter, you guys were able to post pretty strong incremental margins, but looking at and granted it\u2019s only three weeks, but if we look at the recent volume data, it suggests that there has been a pretty material slowdown in growth. Is this sort of a direct result of not having enough crews and obviously the outlook for coal isn\u2019t positive, but do you expect a return to growth in automotive and ag once you get some of these qualified employees in the network? Don Seale : Good morning, Allison. This is Don. We are not seeing a slowdown in our business. What we are seeing is the lapping of very strong comps in the fourth quarter from last year. As you will recall, our merchandise volumes in 2013 in the fourth quarter were up 8% and our intermodal volumes were up 6%. So, we are beginning to face tougher comps year-over-year. The second thing I would add thereto is that we are seeing a deceleration in coal volume on the export side and we are seeing weaker utility volumes as I pointed out due to natural gas prices dropping and milder weather. We also saw our intermodal business peak fairly early toward the end of September. And that is predominantly on the international side with consumer goods coming in for the holiday season. So, I wouldn\u2019t read too much into the year-over-year volumes other than the comp and the fact that coal was decelerating somewhat and that we probably have seen our fall peak even though it was a small fall peak in intermodal. Allison Landry - Credit Suisse : Okay. And as a follow-up question, on the post-retirement and pension expense for this year, could you parse out the difference between the two ends, I know that you made some changes to the post-retirement plan? So, how do we think about what will persist in terms of a tailwind for next year and what are your initial expectations for pension expense in 2015? Marta Stewart : Okay. Well, I will take that in two pieces. First of all, with respect to this quarter in the post-retirement and pension, the bulk of that is post-retirement $31 million and the pension was $8 million. So, both of those were decreased compared to last year. So \u2013 and we have had similar amounts in each quarter this year relative to the prior year. Going forwards into next year, of course that\u2019s going to be \u2013 we will be able to give you more visibility into that in January. That\u2019s going to be dependent on the interest rate as of the end of the year and where our pension assets stand. Thinking about it if we had to look at it as those items right now, we would probably have about even 2015 expenses in the areas compared to 2014. So, in other words, we are not going to have the big letdown that we had in 2014, but we think we are going to stay about even. Allison Landry - Credit Suisse : Okay. And is that basically because the changes that you made in the retiree medical plan could potentially offset any increase in pension expense? Marta Stewart : Well, the change that we made is going forward. So, that\u2019s \u2013 so with regard to post-retirement medical, the change that we made is a go-forward change, so that would impact 2014 and 2015 the same way, that\u2019s why that\u2019s the same. And then the pension on its own, the asset plan, the assets have done very well and unless interest rates change markedly between now and the end of the year, that should stay flat to same. Allison Landry - Credit Suisse : Okay, great. Thank you so much for the clarification. Wick Moorman : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead with your question. Jason Seidl - Cowen & Company: Yes, good morning guys. Staying on the service a little bit, with all these new locomotives coming on, should we start seeing that locomotive increase expense from materials start abating in 4Q? So, should that be a little bit lower than it was in 3Q? Wick Moorman : Jason, I wouldn\u2019t want to predict that it\u2019s going to come down much in the fourth quarter, because they really \u2013 we start to see most of this power in the November-December timeframe, but certainly as we bring these new locomotives in and as velocity improves as Mark says, we are going to have the ability then to take hopefully a good number of these older, higher maintenance, less efficient locomotives out and put them back into our surge fleet and also put them back into the queue where we got a lot of them for our rebuild program. Marta Stewart : And right now, Mark\u2019s folks are estimating. They are going to do whatever it takes to fixing those locomotives. But as you know the locomotive material was up $10 million in the second quarter, $20 million in the third quarter and they think they will be somewhere between those two for the fourth quarter. Jason Seidl - Cowen & Company: Fourth quarter. Okay. Thank you. And as it pertains towards all the merger talk we have and also all the talk about Chicago, Wick I think you mentioned that there is only so much you can do with the rails working together, but what can the railroads do short of a merger to sort of help improve some of the service levels through either joint projects or joint ventures? Wick Moorman : Well, I think everyone is doing a lot of work on that Jason in line \u2013 along the lines of what we are doing. We are very \u2013 we work together in Chicago to try and manage the flows through there. We do that collectively as you know. Every railroad that I am aware of is looking at additional infrastructure, if it\u2019s required on their routes coming into Chicago. Certainly that\u2019s true in the West as you know. And I think that as we do that, as we make sure that we are resourced properly that we are going to be able to handle business and handle more business through Chicago successfully in the future. I think what we \u2013 this is my opinion, I think what we have seen this year is something of an anomaly and that we had as you know an extraordinarily tough winter. And then we had a really very unusual kind of volume growth through a single gateway driven by the energy business and at some point that returns to more normal growth levels and we can manage through that. So I am optimistic that as the great projects continue to come online and as we all work together that Chicago will always be a very, very busy place to operate. We will \u2013 it will occasionally be a tough place to operate. Collectively we can make Chicago work in the current industry configuration. Jason Seidl - Cowen & Company: Thanks for the commentary Wick. And thanks for the time guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz of UBS. Please proceed with your question. Tom Wadewitz - UBS: Yes. Good morning. Wick I guess I apologize for asking you about this again, I don\u2019t know if you love talking about it, but just to be completely clear on this and you have probably said this in various ways. Do you think that it would be \u2013 are you essentially \u2013 do you have a position on rail combinations in terms of you think it\u2019s a bad idea and you think regulators wouldn\u2019t approve it or are you open to the idea and you think there are pluses and minuses or just what\u2019s your kind of clear position on the idea of rail combinations, I know obviously you have talked around it a bit today? Wick Moorman : Well. Tom, this is something that I have said in a lot of forms and I will go ahead and say it briefly. And I will preface it by saying that different people in the industry have different opinions about this. And I will go ahead and say I have a very high regard and respect for the head of the CP, but this is just a place where I have a different opinion. I think that a major railroad merger is not a good idea. It\u2019s highly problematic for three reasons. The first is that our history is that putting these big companies together is very difficult and at least historically has led to significant service problems for some period of time. The second reason is that while historically a lot of mergers were justified because of significant synergies. If you put two big carriers together there aren\u2019t that many overlapping routes. There aren\u2019t that many redundant facilities. You can save some money, yes, but it\u2019s not necessarily order of magnitude that it used to be. And then third and most important. I think it would go into the phase of a regulatory environment, which is not receptive in anyway to major combinations. And there are the new rules out there that it has to be pro-competitive, that is not defined. And it could be defined in ways, that are very onerous and in which you could give up, all of the potential benefits and more in a transaction. So, I just think that \u2013 I just think they don\u2019t make sense at this time. And as I say reasonable people can differ on that, but that\u2019s certainly my opinion. Tom Wadewitz - UBS: Okay. Yes, that\u2019s very helpful. I appreciate you, giving a very clear response to that, that\u2019s very helpful. I have got a question for Don, the yields in third quarter were weaker than we would have expected, I know you gave us a lot of detail on why mix is a headwind in various respects, what is your visibility to pricing and to yields if we go into 2015, discussions with customers, contracts, you have already signed for 2015, do you \u2013 can you give us some flavor and a sense of how much confidence you might have in stronger pricing and stronger yields when you look to 2015? Don Seale : Good morning Tom. As you well know the capacity factor in transportation in North America has tightened significantly. As we have said many times in the past, we price to the marketplace and we see increasing opportunities for price improvements ahead. We have about 15% \u2013 right at 15% of our remaining, pricing to do on the book for 2014 and we have about 50%, right at 50% of our book of business to be reprised in 2015. And we will be taking that tighter transportation capacity into our strategy and you will see that in the results of our price activity. So we price to the market, the market is tight for capacity that enables us to have a more optimistic outlook on pricing ahead. Tom Wadewitz - UBS: Should we expect the yield is going to \u2013 mix is going to continue to be a headwind in 2015 or some of the mix pressures you saw in third quarter maybe they ease up a bit, so the pricing flow through a bit more to the revenue per unit? Wick Moorman : Tom, we have so many moving parts with respect to the different business segments. I even mentioned this morning that in our automotive sector, which was very strong in the third quarter, up 12%. We had a much higher percentage growth in bi-level traffic, which is the cars \u2013 the railcars that transport SUVs and pickup trucks. The load factor is not as high for SUVs and pickup trucks on a railcar versus passenger cars. And there is a differential of about 15% in the revenue per unit \u2013 revenue per car for those bi-levels versus tri-levels. That\u2019s just an example of how the mix continues to play out in coal when our export market is down, that\u2019s our highest revenue per unit business. And when our Northern utility business goes up, for example, that\u2019s lower. So I don\u2019t know what all the combinations are going to be, in 2015 we will just have to see how it works out. But we will continue to see negative mix if nothing else as we grow intermodal at a much faster pace and coal continues to either be flat or modestly down, which is the ultimate mix effect. Tom Wadewitz - UBS: Right. Okay. Thank you for the time. I appreciate it. Wick Moorman : Thanks Tom. Don Seale : Thanks Tom. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup: Thanks. Good morning. I want to talk a little bit about the service metrics and a little bit more about the timing I guess of potential improvements and maybe understanding a little bit better the sequential deterioration at least in the velocity metrics in the terminal Bellevue that we see publically, it seems like we are sort of ending the third quarter, beginning the fourth quarter at a low watermark, just want to get a rough sense. If you think Mark from your perspective that this is sort of November, December as you get those new crews onboard, you start to be able to turn those metrics a little bit more constructively and during the quarter if there was something specifically other than just a confluence of volumes that was causing that sequential deterioration? Mark Manion : Yes. I think we have seen the trough on this and in fact the public metrics do lag a little bit and we are seeing improvement that\u2019s going on more recently and something that we track is specifically where our velocity is at very \u2013 in various parts of our system. And the reality is our Eastern region, our Western region that is two-thirds of our system has been operating rather well from a velocity standpoint. And the problems have been pretty localized to that East-West Gateway between Chicago and Jersey or really Philly. So, we see much better fluidity in that area at this point, still very heavy. I mean, we have still got \u2013 we have still got all the business up there, because as far as the volumes go, that area has continued to have a lot of traffic. And we see that \u2013 I think we see that sustained, but we will see improvement as we go forward in the quarter. And I think we said that last quarter that we will start to see our improvements in the fourth quarter, but as we said before, the people, the resources really come on more in the November-December timeframe, but we are already starting to see that tick up. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then switching gears down, if I could ask you about little bit about the coal side, just want to understand sort of the yield dynamic as we think about fourth quarter and going forward obviously, you have had some mix issues and export declining a little bit. You had a pop in the second quarter, which I think was driven by some of the longer haul utility moves, but as you think out to the fourth quarter with where the seaborne market is and where the utility demand is coming from, is this roughly the right way to be thinking about yield kind of what we saw in the third quarter? Just want to get a rough sense on the mix potential in the shorter term, if I could? Don Seale : Yes, I think what we saw in the third quarter will be what we are seeing in the fourth quarter predominantly sequentially coming from the second to third quarter, you will recall that we had a $43 million increase in coal overall, which was driven predominantly by a 23% increase into our Southeastern utilities that tended to weaken as the summer wore on and we saw milder weather, lower gas prices. So, our Northern utility business was down, but Southern utility was only up about 9% in the third quarter. That did impact RPU. As far as expert goes, we pretty much see the same type of market condition, don\u2019t see a lot of significant change, it\u2019s weak on thermal and met coal and we don\u2019t expect that to improve in the fourth quarter nor do we see any driver for improvement in the first quarter for that. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup: Okay. So, this is sort of the run-rate in the next couple of quarters at least on the export market in your view? Don Seale : We hope so. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup: Okay. Thanks very much for the time. I appreciate it. Wick Moorman : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott Group - Wolfe Research : Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Wick Moorman : Good morning. Scott Group - Wolfe Research : So, Don, that was helpful in terms of their coal mix and how you think about that going forward? I want to ask about intermodal mix with the peak you are saying kind of happening \u2013 happened already maybe international growth going to slow, does intermodal mix become more positive as domestic starts to grow faster? Don Seale : We expect that mix to moderate that mix differential between domestic and international. International has been very strong this year, because of the West Coast ILWU negotiations that shifted business to East Coast ports. We have also had some organic growth with our international partners and some new businesses through new terminals and new contract arrangements. We will start to lap those events as we get into 2015 and we will see domestic growth outpace international growth in my opinion going forward. So, we will see that mix effect start to moderate. Scott Group - Wolfe Research : It should probably reverse and turn positive, is that fair? Don Seale : It will start to turn positive, correct. Scott Group - Wolfe Research : Okay. And then one for Mark, so you gave a lot of numbers around your planning with headcount, I am not sure what it means for net overall headcount the way we see it. What kind of headcount growth do you think we should be modeling in fourth quarter and 2015? And given the catch up in the headcount, you think we will have headcount up more or less than volume growth in 2015? Marta Stewart : I will take the 2014 question and let Mark address the 2015 question. For 2014, we continue to think that we are going to end the year about even to where we were last year. So, that would be \u2013 last quarter, we talked about being 900 up from the second quarter. As Mark said, we are up about 400 this quarter. So, we couldn\u2019t be up another 500 in the fourth quarter. Mark Manion : And going into next year partly in terms of continuing to build our crew base to keep up with today\u2019s business levels and then partly for more business opportunities that are coming up in \u201815 will add another net 500 to 600 people to what we have at the end of the year. Scott Group - Wolfe Research : Okay. So, we should probably think about volume growth still outpacing headcount by a good amount next year? Mark Manion : Oh, yes. For the first, it\u2019s going to take us well really \u2013 we will be working on it through the first half, but keeping in mind that once we end the year and turned the corner into \u201815, the additional people we have are going to be very helpful in terms of improving our service product. So, we won\u2019t be completely done until we get into the latter part of the second quarter. Scott Group - Wolfe Research : Mark, can I just ask what\u2019s the difference in like the 1,900 people you talked about that you are training versus that 500 number, is that just attrition, is that the difference? Mark Manion : Well, I want to make sure I understand the question. I am not sure about the 1,900... Scott Group - Wolfe Research : I thought in your prepared comments and maybe it\u2019s not 1,900, but you gave some, a large number of people currently being trained and adding another 500 people from here. So, that \u2013 is the difference just attrition? Mark Manion : No. I spoke of \u2013 since the beginning of the year, we have started in training or have produced a total of 1,700 plus people. And then I further defined what that \u2013 how that looks in the third quarter and what our net will be by the end of the year? Wick Moorman : Yes. Scott, I think there are three things that go on there. One is, some of this we continue to have attrition in the T&E workforce. So, you \u2013 that\u2019s a number we have to take into account. We have some very modest attrition even in the training program, not much, but there is some there. And then the other thing is at any given time, you are trying to take a snapshot of qualified employees and trainees. So, when Mark talks about the total number of people in the pipeline, there are 500 people who come out, finish their training in the fourth quarter plus or minus. And then their additional people are in that bigger number you mentioned who are finishing their training later in the first quarter of next year. So, it\u2019s always hard to kind of pin down at any given moment what\u2019s going on, but I think the net \u2013 the important message here is that we have a lot of people in the pipeline. We start \u2013 we are seeing, starting to see significant increases, but going back to your original question, our T&E staffing, once we get it to the point where we need for it to be, we will still be growing at a rate that\u2019s less than our volume growth. We still expect continued efficiencies in terms of train length and train operations in the same way that you have seen us produce them over the past couple of years. Scott Group - Wolfe Research : That\u2019s helpful, Wick. Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Brandon Oglenski - Barclays: Yes, good morning everyone. I know it\u2019s been a long call, but I just, Wick, I want to follow-up on that commentary there, because it sounds like there is a lot of puts and takes as we look at 2015. I mean, if you are adding all these assets and people, you should get better productivity as you just mentioned. Does that suggest that the sustainability in incremental margins like we have seen this year should extend into 2015? Wick Moorman : I will let Marta comment on that too. I do think that as we increase \u2013 there is no question as we increase network velocity even whereas we add these resources that it\u2019s a more efficient railroad, it\u2019s a more productive railroad. And in addition it augments our opportunities for volume growth because of the service component. So there is a lot of good news there. In terms of incremental margins, Marta I think our expectation is they will \u2013 they will remain very strong, whether they will continue quite at the pace that we have seen them this year, we are not sure, but we except to continue to produce strong incremental margins in the business. Marta Stewart : I agree with you. The only thing I would add to that is just a reminder and publicly already had this, Brandon but just a reminder that this year\u2019s incremental margin is affected by the post-retirement medical and pension, which Allison asked about. So if you back that out, we would get more to a \u2013 more closer to a run rate incremental margin. Brandon Oglenski - Barclays: Well, completely understood. And I think that translates on a pretty bright outlook here for the company. And so if I can just ask one follow-up here, I mean you guys have well over $1 billion in cash right now and I know you have some debt maturities, but it seems like your share repurchase program has really slowed down, you have a big authorization out there. With that outlook and arguably one of the cheapest valuations within your sector right now and in the marketplace why not be more aggressive on the share repurchase? Marta Stewart : Well, as you know Brandon, I mean, we believe in share repurchases. We have been a long time buyer of our shares, other than the recessionary year 2009 we bought back a significant number of shares since 2006. But over that time period and continuing into now, we moderate those share repurchases just based on overall market volatility. And so, all I can say is that we remain share repurchase, we expect to continue to remain that and we will just go into modulate it based on market conditions. Wick Moorman : Brandon, let me add to that. As we always discuss, our first priority is capital expenditures to grow the company, we are in the middle of that process right now. Our second is dividends, we have a very strong dividend track record and we will continue to have a strong dividend policy. And then share repurchases, as Marta said we are \u2013 we stay in the market, but I will also say it\u2019s something that we constantly reevaluate. And we will continue to reevaluate it and certainly the factors that you mentioned are very legitimate factors. So going forward, we will continue to look at that. And if we see a point \u2013 see a certain point where we think we need to become more aggressive or change our policy we are certainly willing to do that and will. Brandon Oglenski - Barclays: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna International. Please go ahead with your question. Bascome Majors - Susquehanna International : Thanks for the time. So the fuel surcharge program you introduced in 2008, I believe it kicks in at $90 WTI and oil has trended below that for most of this month, which would imply that at least fuel prices could fall further while at least some of your surcharge revenues are staying flat and I know that\u2019s not your only program in summer based at lower levels, but can you give us an update on the fuel surcharge mix and how it trends among your business groups and how you expect lower fuel prices to impact your revenues on that front going forward if energy prices were to trend around where they are today? Don Seale : Good morning. This is Don. As you indicated, we have many different fuel surcharge formulas that have been negotiated with numerous customers in contracts and other instruments, so we do not have one fuel surcharge program. Our carload business generally is based off of West Texas Intermediate crude oil, while our intermodal business is based on highway diesel fuel. So we don\u2019t even have the same standards for all of the business because there are different characteristics of the business itself. So we have a 60-day lag generally on our carload business, a weekly lag on our intermodal business that will continue to move up and down with crude oil prices, diesel prices, crack spreads all of the things that impact fuel over time. So I can\u2019t give you a specific outlook for that, because frankly I can\u2019t tell you where the forward curve will windup for West Texas Intermediate crude or on highway diesel for next year. Bascome Majors - Susquehanna International : If oil were to stay in the low $80 range, is there a significant portion in your business where surcharges would be locked in at or not fall further? Don Seale : I just can\u2019t give you color on that because we have so many different formulas that have been negotiated with customers. Bascome Majors - Susquehanna International : Alright. Well, thank you for the time. Don Seale : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Our next question is from the line of John Larkin with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. John Larkin - Stifel: Thanks gentlemen for taking my questions. Wick Moorman : Thank you, John. John Larkin - Stifel: Just wanted to talk a little bit more about the application of incremental crews and incremental locomotives to solve the service issues that you have been grappling with here the last couple of quarters, it seems to me that as things play out here into 2015 that you are going to have enough resources to bring your velocity up, new terminals dwell down which effectively will create more capacity. Now, you said earlier that the new locomotives will be here and that will give you the opportunity the push to the more costly less efficient older units into the reserve fleet, how do you handle the crew situation at that point, if in fact you do rebound to previous velocity in terminal dwell numbers? Mark Manion : Well, that would be a good thing. As far as the crew base goes, we are planning like I said on that 500 or 600 net add people next year. But as velocity comes \u2013 as velocity goes up, it lessens the need for crews. So we can always throttle that back some if we need to. John Larkin - Stifel: Okay. And then Marta, you answered a question earlier regarding the cost of the congestion and I was just wondering if there was a revenue component to that also if in fact service had gotten to the point in some parts of the network where customers have gone a different direction with their transportation needs until you can get this service back up to where it needs to be? Don Seale : This is Don. On the top line side of our business, car utilization and available capacity to move more volume is probably the larger concern with respect to current velocity. Obviously, we are having some pressure points with certain customers. We are working through those, but my larger concern is utilization of equipment and capacity of the fleet in general. John Larkin - Stifel: Is it reasonable to assume that revenue growth might have been a point or two higher if you would not have those equipment availability problems? Don Seale : We would have had some higher revenue in the automotive sector. Some areas like that, but I would like to maybe showcase that question and just point out that sequentially from the second quarter to the third quarter, the second quarter was our all time high top line revenue. We only missed that by $19 million in the third quarter with coal being the swing of $58 million between the second quarter and the third quarter. We were up $43 million in coal in the second quarter. We were down $15 million in the third quarter. So, sequentially we came close to meeting an all time record with coal swings of $58 million quarter-to-quarter. John Larkin - Stifel: Got it. Thanks for the color. Don Seale : Thanks, John. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Justin Long - Stephens: Thanks. And I wanted to ask my first question on pricing, as you have implemented some of the rate increases in intermodal that you talked about last quarter, have shippers been pretty receptive given the tightness in capacity or are you getting any pushback on pricing up in this type of service environment? Don Seale : We are always sensitive to the timing of pricing, but capacity and tight capacity are the two things that are driving price improvement in today\u2019s marketplace. So the price increases that we took in are domestic rail controlled containers. In June and September have stuck and we continue to assess that market going forward for additional price opportunity. Justin Long - Stephens: Okay, great. And as a follow-up on coal, I wanted to ask about domestic coal into 2015 and I know it\u2019s tough, but let\u2019s just assume normal weather patterns and based on the stockpile levels that you referenced in recent conversations with customers, do you think domestic coal is flat or down again in 2015 or is there a chance you could see some improvement? Don Seale : Let\u2019s segment the market with respect to export, with the Australian currency differential expanding and the benchmark met coal price of $119 a ton and a thermal index to Europe at about $72 a ton, if those two indices continue to be that low, U.S. producers will be very pressured to have any growth in export in 2015. The wildcard as I mentioned on our utility call will be what kind of weather we have during the winter. We are 19% below stockpiles as of December 2013 right now. And if we get anything like last year\u2019s winter, we will see some increase in demand for utility coal during the winter and coming out of the winter, because I suspect natural gas prices will rise as they did last year and electricity demand will increase. So, those are export, we don\u2019t see any significant driver in the near-term. Utility would be the upcoming winter and what kind of weather we get. Justin Long - Stephens: Okay, fair enough. I will leave it at that. Thanks for the time. Don Seale : Welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC. Please proceed with your question. Walter Spracklin - RBC: Yes, thanks very much. Most of my questions have been answered. I am just going to follow-up on one and that is on your buyback. I know, Wick, you were saying about reevaluating constantly that buyback and certainly it\u2019s trended well below what we thought you would do when you announced your last program. So, I see $1.5 billion in cash on the balance sheet, but also about $550 million of debt repaid. In that reevaluation aspect, what has caused you a little bit of concern about buying back your shares at these levels and if you do reevaluate, do we go to \u2013 what is the flex up that we could see, is it incremental or could you see a significant increase in your buyback next year? Wick Moorman : Well, I don\u2019t know that I would comment on what we would see in terms of any magnitude of the change. I would certainly think though that as we went into the year, we were looking at all of the factors around share price. And as they have moved \u2013 and as factors have changed, valuations have changed, we will take a look and see if our program needs to be evaluated again as I mentioned. I think the important message is that this is something obviously that we actively discuss and that we look at where markets are and we will come to an opinion on what we need to do go forward in 2015. Walter Spracklin - RBC: Okay. Just to slip in another one I guess on the crude by rail, we have heard the other companies talk about the factors and spreads and drivers in their specific origination markets that might \u2013 that the current volatility in the energy prices would cause. Don, are you \u2013 what are you hearing from your customers in terms of their propensity to relax some of their shipments on crew that you either originate or carry by interchange, what\u2019s your thoughts going forward on that market? Wick Moorman : We are not receiving any input from our customers that the short-term Brent crude spreads that have become very close or within $3 a barrel right now are impacting their plans to continue to take Bakken and Western Canadian crude. We are being told that most of them have arrangements that go beyond short-term fluctuations in the market and their expectations are that the Brent and WTI spread will increase over the next several months. Walter Spracklin - RBC: And barring that increase then we might see some action? Wick Moorman : We are not getting that indication. At this point, our crude oil for example in the third quarter was over 12,000 cars. Over the third quarter of 2013, we are now handling 30,000 cars a quarter, which is what the third quarter represented. So, we are seeing our crude oil business both from Western Canada and from the Bakken, the Williston Basin continue to show some robust dynamics. Walter Spracklin - RBC: Okay, that\u2019s all my questions. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Rob Salmon of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank : Hey, good morning. Mark, you did a really good job in terms of laying out the expectations with regard to overall locomotives and crew that are coming on and how that should play out with regard to service performance. If I could barrel in a little bit more in terms of your intermodal service performance, it looks like that\u2019s taken a little bit of a harsher leg down and kind of the start of the fourth quarter relative to where we have been in the third. Could you talk a little bit about the dynamics and how you see that side of this segment kind of improving throughout the fourth quarter? I realize a lot of this traffic is coming on that Chicago and to kind of the New England area, which is more heavily congested right now? Mark Manion : Yes, I would be glad to. And that fits right up with the comment I made about the fluidity on that East West corridor opening up so nicely here more recently. And along with that while our intermodal terminals still have a lot of business, they are heavy. They are in a very \u2013 what I will call, a very orderly fashion. So, they are able to process well in the intermodal terminals and our mainlines which as I have said before is our heaviest capacity mainlines we have got on the system. They are open for business. So, I see that moving in a positive direction for our intermodal business as we go into the rest of the fourth quarter. Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And I guess given the lower kind of overall fuel prices, obviously that does cage a little bit of the value proposition for the intermodal side of the business, Don. If the intermodal velocity improvements are constrained, would that cage it all your optimism for the growth outlook for intermodal as we look out into 2015 at kind of current WTI levels or are the trucking capacity constraints such that you think you will be able to materially outgrow GDP even if the velocity is constrained near-term? Don Seale : The latter is the case trucking and motor carrier capacity will be tight in 2015. We don\u2019t foresee fuel prices at current levels changing that dynamic or changing the economic model. So, we expect our domestic intermodal business to continue to show significant growth. Rob Salmon - Deutsche Bank : Perfect. Thanks so much for the time guys. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Thomas Kim with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs : Good morning. I just had a couple of questions on the coal side. In prior calls, you talked about export coal freight rates effectively bottoming out and I was wondering Don, if you could just give us a little bit of color around the third quarter export coal freight rates versus the second in the prior quarter and maybe year-on-year? Don Seale : No change second to third quarter and we anticipate no change third to fourth quarter and for that matter based on what we are seeing first quarter as well. Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs : Okay, thanks. And then just with regard to the utility coal mix, can you talk a little bit more about how the sourcing has shifted maybe Q-on-Q like could you give us a breakdown of how much coal is coming from the App versus Illinois Basin and so on? Don Seale : Yes. We are still about 34% of our originated coal coming out of Central App, 28% coming out of Northern App, 19% from the Illinois Basin, and 16% from the PRB. The largest change as you know year-over-year that we described in the second quarter is the Illinois Basin now exceeding the originations that we handle from PRB. Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs : Thank you. Don Seale : Welcome. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter of Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch : Great. Good afternoon I guess by now. Just wanted to follow-up on the efficiencies and I guess this might sound odd just given your operating ratio being at the 67, but looking at you talked about having more locomotives on the fleet now. If we go back a decade, you still haven\u2019t hit peak volume, so kind of surprising you have got more locomotives, I just want to understand over the past years have we lost some of those efficiency gains? Does it take a whole new operating plan or anything that has to shift in order to get the velocity and everything back up or is this just little bit by little bit just looking at with some of the other carriers we have seen making major changes to improve performance, I just want to understand, how we have gotten to this point of decreasing efficiency yet having more on the network, should we take some of that off in terms of locomotives, in crew and get that efficiency back up? Don Seale : Well, obviously a big add on these locomotives these days is working our way out of a difficult situation with the velocity issue. So, we should see that improve as we go into next year like we have already talked about. But in addition to that we have got to keep in mind that there has been a significant mix change over time. And with the \u2013 with our intermodal business growing the way it has that adds locomotives to the fleet. And just looking at productivity in a little broader way also keep in mind that we are three years in a real concerted way working on various things from a productivity standpoint that has had the effect of lowering our overall cost structure and that\u2019s why we see a more modest expense increase with all these other things going on. Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch : But just to understand that when they will be more I guess unit trains, if you are running more intermodal and especially given that Crescent and Heartland Corridor build outs, say you have got kind of more point to point, I guess I am just trying to understand have you put too much onto create too much congestion and that\u2019s causing that velocity, given the volumes, I am just trying to understand versus 10 years ago, where you had more volumes, and now you have got more locomotives and more infrastructure on the network today, I am just trying to understand is there something that needs to be overhauled in the operating plan or is it just continuing to add more assets? Wick Moorman : Well, I think \u2013 let me add to what Mark said. If you go back 10 years, the railroad and the operations looked very different than they do today in terms of our mix of business. And we have added substantially more intermodal business. It\u2019s a big \u2013 much bigger part of our franchise and intermodal trains are dispatched with higher horsepower for trailing ton and that\u2019s had a significant impact on our locomotive requirements. The second thing that has happened to us is that our unit trains have grown significantly and particularly with the crude oil, but even before that with real emphasis on unit trains in Ag, automotive and grain. And all of that traffic is great traffic and it\u2019s very profitable and we won it. And that\u2019s the way the customers want to ship it. But it has in some ways also impacted our requirements for locomotives. Unit train movements in and of themselves require more locomotives for volume growth than just putting volume on the existing merchandise network. So we \u2013 listen, we tune our operating plan every year. We have a significant number as Mark mentioned of operating efficiencies and plans for even more. And we will continue to achieve even more. But as I think I said earlier, can every franchise \u2013 every railroad franchise is different and we do a lot of analysis on our franchise to ensure that we don\u2019t have too many locomotives but that we don\u2019t have too few. Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch : Great. And Wick, if I can just revisit your answer to Tom\u2019s question on the M&A side, you talked about history of putting them together was difficult and the mergers didn\u2019t justify or might not have as many synergy opportunities and then the regulatory environment, what was your reaction though when you heard this news that you said no way, right away do you think, hey we have got to sit down with the Board and sit and look at opportunities because if CSX is taken off the board, do we need to think about how we lineup because yesterday obviously on Hunter\u2019s call you kind of went over why the regulatory issue might not be as big, but it\u2019s kind of finding a partner and gaining efficiency. So just trying to understand what was your and perhaps the Board\u2019s kind of view in terms if it does move forward, how do you think the industry changes or does it not and that\u2019s just a one-off? Wick Moorman : Well, I think without going into specifics, listen we are always thinking and always have about the industry structure and ways that it might change and we review that with the Board every year. As we go forward, if there are changes in the structure and as I said earlier, people have different views of what the potential is, what the likelihood of a transaction being approved is, we will evaluate it with our Board and see if there are actions that we need to take and that\u2019s what we have always done. That\u2019s what we will always do. But I will say something I was \u2013 Jim Squires reminded me of and that is that we may not agree or may not agree with Hunter on everything, but there is something that Hunter and I agree on wholeheartedly as does everyone else in this business is that we don\u2019t really have to mergers to have a very bright future here at Norfolk Southern and as an industry. Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch : Wonderful. Appreciate the time and insight. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein Investments. Please proceed with your question. David Vernon - Bernstein Investments : Hi, good morning and thanks for taking the question. Don, could you comment a little bit about how historically you have seen tighter truck capacity or looser truck capacity actually impact rates in the merchandise segment, obviously, excluding the coal and the intermodal business, just trying to think what percentage move in truck rates has turned into what type of base pricing kind of in your experience? Don Seale : Well, certainly as the trucking market tightens, it has a positive halo effect on intermodal pricing opportunity, as well as the carload pricing opportunity. In our merchandised business, anything that moves in a box car from paper products to consumer products, to manufactured components, a lot of that business is directly competitive or driven by trucking capacity and that gives us an opportunity, so \u2013 and other components like automotive parts and vehicles, steel traffic, so there is a range of commodities that tighter truckload capacity. And when I say truckload capacity, I am talking about everything from dry van to flat beds, to covered bulk trucking that gives us an opportunity. And I would add not just trucking, when we look at the barge industry right now, it is essentially sold out and agricultural commodities and with the crop being as large as it is we expect barge to continue to face that type of capacity constraints. All of those are pointing to a market that\u2019s more favorable for improving yields in our book of business. David Vernon - Bernstein Investments : But I guess, as you think about how to dimension that and how you have seen it kind of play out in the past, is there anything you can share as far as orders of magnitude in terms of how impactful the changes in the trucking market are? Don Seale : I can\u2019t really put a number behind it or a past trend. I will just say that we see it as a positive opportunity in the marketplace. David Vernon - Bernstein Investments : Okay. And then maybe just as a quick follow-up, you mentioned that the export rates had held in flat sort of sequentially, but it does look like the rate per ton is still down a little bit sequentially, is that just that mix in the underlying domestic because the overall length of haul doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s changing all that much. So I am just wondering is there any pressure on you guys to start thinking about pricing in that domestic market given the challenges and competition with lower price gas? Don Seale : No, there are no pressure points that change from the second quarter to the third quarter. It\u2019s all relative to mix. We saw our Southern utility\u2019s long haul traffic start to moderate in terms of its year-over-year increase because of milder summer weather and lower natural gas prices. And also within the export market, we saw a relative larger decline in tonnage over our Lamberts Point pier versus our Baltimore tonnage which is shorter haul. David Vernon - Bernstein Investments : Alright. Thanks for the time. Don Seale : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead with your question. Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham Research : Thank you very much and good evening everyone. Thank you for taking my question. Well, first of all, congratulations on a challenging quarter. I would like to ask about two items which I think are more temporary in terms of weighing on earnings. Marta, you hit the first regarding the cost of congestion, you talked about the $10 million and over time, you talked about the effect of locomotive maintenance. What you didn\u2019t discuss is maybe what the effect of this congestion at slower train speed might be having on insurance and claims. I know you did note the $15 million increase in personal injury reserve, what do you believe, Wick or Don, the impact of this congestion is having on your claims expense and do you believe this is more of a transitory thing and when fluidity gets better, we hopefully see that begin to come down? And how would you ballpark the impact of that financially? Marta Stewart : Well, we don\u2019t believe that the service is having any impact on our claims expense. I think what I was talking about there was the year-over-year last year in the third and fourth quarters, we had favorable claims experience and so the comp this year. So, we have a comparative increase, but the cost themselves have not increased because of the service. Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham Research : But your personal injury rates up above the last couple of years level and it\u2019s up above the 9 months level, what would you attribute that to? Marta Stewart : That isn\u2019t in a serious injury area that would be impacting expenses in any significant way, but I will have Mark elaborate. Mark Manion : Yes. As far as our \u2013 the injury rates this year, we had some higher injuries, actually January, February, second quarter was improved and now third quarter is improved as well. And we have got a strong start on fourth quarter. So, that\u2019s actually going in the right direction. Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham Research : Alright. And then let me switch to Don, Don it seems like a lot of shorter term items are depressing the yield. I know you mentioned coal may stick around for a while, but others are more mix related, but your revenue per car was up almost a percent last quarter, is down almost a percent this quarter. What do you think the underlying rate of core price increases are relative to kind of what the reported rev per car we are seeing is? And when do you think we start to see a number that\u2019s a little closer to what your core pricing is actually doing? Don Seale : We see our core pricing continuing to exceed rail inflation right now. We think it will continue to get better. The all-inclusive less fuel index, which is in a lot of our contracts in the third quarter only generated about 0.8% in terms of year-over-year increase, that is slated to increase in the fourth quarter up to about 1.8% and for 2015 is projected to be running about 2.5%, 2.6%. So, we will see the escalators in our base contracts and our re-pricing activity, which I have discussed relative to a much tighter transportation capacity market. Those two in combination you will continue to see improvement in our overall revenue per unit and also our core price. Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham Research : Okay, guys. Thanks a lot. I know it\u2019s been a long call. Wick Moorman : Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Keith Schoonmaker of Morningstar. Please go ahead with your question. Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar: Yes, thanks. You can\u2019t knock the operating ratio, but long run are there strategic paths that would enable handling demand surges while maintaining high service or is this just inevitable nature of dealing with high demand? For example, changes to work rules or single man crews that might enable handling a little more adeptly? Wick Moorman : I think that\u2019s a great question. One of the things that we certainly are doing right now as going back and looking through a lot of our processes and a lot of our practices to see \u2013 to take the lessons learned. And clearly, one thing that we are very \u2013 I think very thoughtful about is adding some more what I would describe as resiliency to our network. And that can come in the way, shape of a slightly different, not radically different way in terms of how we think about our crew base, particularly in critical areas. It can come in the form of making of having the somewhat bigger search fleet of locomotives. And it certainly comes in the form of doing something, which as many of you know we have systematically done. We just think about continuing to look at pinch points on the network. So, I think that we will take these learnings and we will make some changes that will give us that additional resiliency. Certainly, work rules are something we are always focused on. There is another round of labor negotiations that kicks off here soon. And we will see if there are things that can be done there as well, but I think that we can do a lot in the shorter term to give ourselves the ability to handle situations a little better, but I will go back to what I said. I think we had a somewhat extraordinary set of circumstances this year with the very unusual weather followed immediately by significant surge in traffic beyond what we expected, but we will learn from that. Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar: Great. Thanks. And just as a quick follow-up on service issues, do you believe that highway conversions was constrained or slowed due to service issues or does trucking capacity offset most of these decisions? Wick Moorman : I think the overall intermodal network we saw growth that we would have seen. I think equipment availability would have been a little higher in the third quarter, which could have generated on the margin higher volumes and higher revenue in intermodal and automotive. I will add automotive to that. I don\u2019t think it was material. Going forward, we don\u2019t see in the fourth quarter and into 2015, we do not see a lot of excess trucking capacity that can take any diverted traffic from rail, not that we expect that. So, as our service continues to improve that really shouldn\u2019t be a major concern going forward. Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar: Good. Thank you. High quality problem to have. Wick Moorman : Yes, thanks. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Cleo Zagrean with Macquarie. Please go ahead with your question. Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie: Good morning and thank you. Could you please comment a little more on same-store pricing trends in the quarter, perhaps put some detail into re-pricing for new business and how you see the balance of price and volume begin to shape for \u201815? Thank you. Mark Manion : As we have indicated, we are seeing our core pricing coming in, in excess of rail inflation. We expect that to pick up as we continue to re-price into 2015. As I mentioned, we still have about 15% of our 2014 book to re-price at about 50% of our business next year in 2015 to re-price and our prices will reflect the tighter capacity in the transportation market as we complete that. Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie: Thank you. And as my follow-up, we heard yesterday on the Canadian Pacific merger conference call, their view that the national network is about to hit some limits to capacity and efficiency, absent mergers which they see as the main solution. Would you agree that absent mergers, the national network is coming up with some significant challenges? And maybe as part of your response, if you could help us with some quantification of impact of your infrastructure projects into next year\u2019s results and into the longer term as much as you would like to comment? Thank you. Wick Moorman : Well, I am not really of the opinion that we are in any imminent danger of hitting significant capacity problems across the industry that will impact our ability to grow for the longer term. I think if you just look at Norfolk Southern and the things that we are doing in terms of everything that Mark mentioned the Bellevue expansion, a lot of work in our Chicago, Philadelphia corridor and a lot of work in other places to streamline the network to add capacity in critical areas. I think that we have a very solid program as we have had for years and we will continue to have to strategically augment our capacity as we see volume growth. When we get into a period as I have said several times of unusual volume growth that was difficult for us to predict, we may get a little bit behind the curve as we have, but we are responding to that. We have a lot of work underway. And once that work is in place, we expect our velocities to go right back up as we have said. So, I think that \u2013 and I think every rail carrier looks at it that way. So, I think we have the ability to continue to invest, continue to add infrastructure and continue to grow the business without the need for our merger. Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie: Thank you. So, to clarify, you do not see any structural thresholds or limits to growth for the industry given the current makeup of the players? Wick Moorman : No, I don\u2019t. I think that we can all respond as individual carriers and working together to handle what we think is, as I said before, a very bright future in terms of increased volume on the railroads. Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie: Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I will turn the floor back to management for closing comments. Wick Moorman - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Well, thank you very much everyone for your patience and for the very good questions. We appreciate them and we look forward to talking to you again at the end of next quarter. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Katie Cook, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Ms. Cook. You may now begin. Katie Cook : Thank you, Rob and good morning. Before we begin today\u2019s call, I would like to mention a few items. First, the slides of the presenters are available on our website at norfolksouthern.com in the Investors section. Additionally, transcripts and downloads of today\u2019s call will be posted on our website. Please be advised that during this call we may make certain forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially from those projected. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. Additionally, keep in mind that all references to reported results, excluding certain adjustments that is, non-GAAP numbers have been reconciled on our website in the Investors section. Now, it is my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Wick Moorman. Wick Moorman : Thank you, Katie and good morning everyone. It is my pleasure to welcome you to our fourth quarter 2014 earnings conference call. With me today are several members of our senior team, including our President, Jim Squires; our Chief Marketing Officer, Don Seale; our Chief Operating Officer, Mark Manion; and our Chief Financial Officer, Marta Stewart. As all of you know by now after 39 years of exemplary service Don has decided to retire effective March 01st. Therefore this will be his last earnings call, and I know all of you join me in wishing him a long and happy retirement.  Turning now to our financial results, I am pleased to report that Norfolk Southern achieved another solid quarter, which completed an outstanding 2014 financial performance with record annual results across the board including all-time highs for revenues, income from operations, operating ratio, net income, and earnings per share.  Looking at our top line, revenues for the fourth quarter were $2.9 billion, flat compared to our record 2013 fourth-quarter revenue, despite a 15% decrease in coal revenue and lower fuel surcharge revenue. Overall volumes increased 4% as growth in intermodal and merchandise more than offset a 6% decline in coal volumes. For the full year, revenues were $11.6 billion, up 3%, notwithstanding a 6% decline in coal revenue. Don will provide you with all of the revenue details in a few minutes. Our fourth-quarter operating expenses were down 1%, resulting in a fourth-quarter record $891 million of income from railway operations and a 69.0% operating ratio, which is a 40 basis point improvement compared to 2013. This enabled us to end the full year with an operating ratio of 69.2, the company's first ever sub-70% operating ratio and a 180 basis point improvement over 2013.  As all of you know, we were able to achieve these results in the face of service challenges and the fourth quarter was no exception. However, as you also know, we have worked diligently to improve our velocity and operating metrics, and we saw definite improvement after the Thanksgiving holidays. Mark will go over our service metrics and provide you with the latest update on our initiatives for improvement.  Fourth-quarter net income of $511 million and earnings per share of $1.64 were comparable to 2013's record results. For the full year, record level net income and earnings per share increased 8% and 9%, respectively, excluding the large land sale that benefited 2013. Marta will cover this as well as the rest of the financials with you in more detail. We are excited about delivering another year of record results and even more excited that our service product has turned the corner after a few difficult months. We remain optimistic about our prospects going forward, and on that note I will turn the program over to Don, Mark, and Marta. I will then return with some closing comments and we will take your questions. Don? Don Seale : Thank you, Wick, and good morning, everyone. Our fourth-quarter revenue was $2.9 billion, as Wick indicated, roughly even with a very strong fourth quarter of 2013, with gains in merchandise and intermodal offset by a decline in coal. Merchandise revenue increased $56 million, or 3%, while intermodal revenue increased 31 million, or 5%, compared to last year. Coal revenue declined 98 million, or 15%, with weaker shipments in utility and export markets.  Volume increases in intermodal and merchandise generated 103 million of positive revenue variance in the fourth quarter. Despite volume increases, fuel surcharge revenues declined 45 million compared to 2013 as a result of as a result of a 13% decline in West Texas intermediate oil prices compared to 2013.  Additionally, revenues were impacted by the negative mix effects associated with higher intermodal volumes and lower coal volumes. The combined impacts of reduced fuel surcharge revenue and negative mix resulted in an overall ARPU decline of 4%.  Total volume for the quarter was up 4%, or roughly 66,000 units due to a 6% gain in intermodal shipments and a 5% gain in merchandise shipments, which offset a 6% decline in coal. Our merchandise business benefited from very strong chemicals and metals and construction volumes, which were offset by declines in agriculture and paper and forest products. Fourth-quarter intermodal volumes were up over 57,000 units or 6%, compared to fourth quarter 2013 with particular strength in international volumes. And our coal volumes declined by 6% due to weak shipments in both export and utility markets. Now breaking out the market segments on the next slide starting with coal as shown on Slide 4, coal revenue was down $98 million or 15%, compared to fourth quarter last year with volume down 6%. Coal ARPU declined 10% in the quarter as a result of reduced fuel surcharge revenue as well as the negative mix impact of reduced export volume.  Overall utility coal volume declined by 6% in the quarter, driven by lower coal burn and lower natural gas prices.  Shipments to northern utilities were down 9%, due primarily to a previously announced market share loss, a negative comparison which we cleared on January 1st of this year. Finally, utility coal volumes were suppressed by weakened service levels, which we estimate to be about 1 million tons in the quarter. We expect to make up most of those deferred tons not handled in the fourth quarter. The export coal market continues to be impacted by strong global competition and a weak demand environment. Weak market fundamentals and the falling Australian dollar drove a 25% decline in export shipments for the quarter. Volumes within our domestic metallurgical markets were up 13% with customer-specific gains in coke shipments driving growth.  Intermodal revenue in the fourth quarter increased by $31 million or 5% to 649 million, due to 6% volume growth. Revenue per unit was down 1% for the quarter as positive pricing activity was offset by lower fuel surcharge revenues and the negative mix impact of higher volumes of lower ARPU international freight. Domestic intermodal volumes were up 4% for the quarter with gains due to highway conversions and growth with key accounts. Growth in this segment was slowed in the quarter as a result of lower network velocity.  On the international side, strong growth of 10% was driven by new contract business, the introduction of new service lanes, and West Coast labor disruption. The five carload business groups shown on the next slide within our merchandise market had mixed results in the fourth quarter, with strong gains in metals and construction and chemicals offset by weaker volumes of agriculture, paper and forest product commodities. Total merchandise revenue of 1.7 billion was up 3% or $56 million versus 2013, with ARPU down $31 or 1% for the quarter as a result of lower fuel surcharge revenues. Metals and construction volumes were up 12% for the quarter, with increased volumes of slabs, coil steel, frac sand and aggregates. Chemicals volumes were up 14% for the quarter, driven by continued gains of crude by rail and natural gas liquid shipments. Following a strong quarter, our automotive volumes were flat in the fourth quarter compared to 2013. These volumes were impacted by both plant downtime and model changeovers at key Norfolk Southern served plants. Volumes within our agricultural markets were negatively impacted by network velocity as soybean shipments declined versus last year due to longer cycle times, which limited railcar availability. This decline was partially offset by increased corn volumes to ethanol producers and feed markets in the Southeast. Finally, paper and forest products volumes declined 2% in the quarter, with increased volumes of lumber and wood products offset by declining shipments of graphic paper and municipal solid waste.  Now before I conclude with our outlook, I will make a couple of comments about our fuel surcharge programs. The WTI oil curve shown here in this graph on the slide will negatively impact our surcharge programs at current projected oil prices. Over 85% of our revenue base is covered by negotiated fuel surcharges that totaled $1.3 billion in 2014. These surcharges were almost evenly split between WTI and on-highway diesel-based programs. More than two-thirds of the WTI-based surcharge revenue programs contained trigger prices above the current WTI price per barrel. At these expected prices these contracts will yield zero fuel surcharges in 2015. The remaining WTI-based contracts as well as the on-highway diesel-based contracts are expected to generate fuel surcharge revenue, but at a substantially lower rate than in 2014. Now concluding with our outlook, we anticipate continued opportunities for volume and revenue growth across most of our business units in 2015 despite headwinds with fuel surcharge revenue. The exception again will be the coal markets, both domestically and in the export sector. We expect utility coal volumes will be impacted by lower natural gas prices. Within the export sector, global oversupply, low commodity pricing, and a weaker Australian dollar will leave US producers at a disadvantage in the world marketplace. Turning to intermodal, highway conversions will continue to generate growth with key domestic customers across our strategic intermodal corridors. And on the international side, we expect additional volumes due to new customers and service offerings.  Our outlook for our merchandise book of business continues to be positive. We project continued growth in crude oil shipments to East Coast refiners, but possibly at a lower rate of growth in view of current WTI and Brent spreads. And we expect continued gains in natural gas liquids and drilling materials, such as frac sand and pipe, due to strong activity within the Marcellus and Utica shale regions. We anticipate higher steel volumes to support the commercial construction and automotive sectors and increased road construction activity will boost volumes of aggregates and asphalts, while growth in housing starts will generate higher volumes of lumber and construction materials. Automotive volumes are expected to increase with vehicle production at several key NS-served plants, well above the industry average increase of 1% in production for 2015.  And within agriculture we expect increased soybean volumes and higher ethanol and feed shipments ahead. So in total we expect broad-based growth in 2015, but the headwinds will be coal and top-line revenue associated with the fuel surcharge forward curve.  In summary, moving forward in 2015 as we manage the components of the top line, we remain committed to making the necessary improvements to provide the level of service our customers expect with growth across our intermodal and merchandise business segments. We will also continue to employ market-based pricing, which, due to tight transportation capacity across all modes, will trend higher in 2015. Thanks for your attention and Mark will now go over our operations report. Mark Manion : Thank you, Don. It's good to see the continued traffic growth in the fourth quarter. While network velocity for the full fourth quarter declined, our velocity and overall operation improved in December. Remember that last quarter I said customers should start to notice improvements in service and service consistency during the fourth quarter, and that has indeed been the case as December numbers showed a decided uptick in our performance levels. As we continue to apply resources where needed and focus on improving the operation, we expect that improvement to continue.  Turning to Slide 2, our 2014 reportable injury ratio is 1.20 for 200,000 employee hours worked. That is a slight uptick from 2013, which was driven by a difficult first quarter in 2014.  The primary objective of our safety process is for all employees to get home safely to their families after each workday. We are working hard in 2015 to build on the benefits of behavior-based safety and working collaboratively with our employees to prevent injuries. We are very pleased to report that there were no employee work fatalities in 2014. That\u2019s an important safety accomplishment, but it goes without saying that we are continuing to work to significantly reduce all injuries. Train accidents for 2014 were up slightly from 2013 at 2.4 per 1 million train miles, but the NS accident ratio remains better than the industry average.  Grade crossing accidents have increased to 3.9 per 1 million train miles for 2014 compared to 3.6 for 2013. As you can see, they have improved in the fourth quarter. NS remains at an active leadership role with the national Operation Lifesaver driver and trespasser safety education program as well as company campaigns.  I am also pleased to let you know that we recently accepted -- were accepted as a member to the Campbell Institute, the research arm for the National Safety Council. Membership is reserved for companies that demonstrate world-class environmental and safety leadership. Achieving membership reflects our continued commitment to environmental health and safety leadership and improvement.  Moving to Slide 3, our composite service metric dropped to 62.8 in the fourth quarter, but you can see there was some nice recovery in December. As I said last quarter, positioning T&E forces was our immediate focus and I outlined several steps we've taken to bring T&E forces in line with current and expected volume. I also outlined several infrastructure projects across the Chicago/New Jersey corridor that were nearing completion. In addition, I detailed the timeline for the acquisition of additional locomotives in the fourth quarter.  The first of the larger conductor trainee classes completed training and were placed in qualified status beginning in November. In November and December we qualified and placed into service 397 new conductors. The Englewood fly-over at Chicago was completed in October separating NS and Metra operations for improved fluidity. In November, we completed the expansion of our classification yard at Bellevue, adding capacity and additional flexibility to operations across the northern region. Also in December, we put six new staging tracks for unit trains at our Conway terminal near Pittsburgh.  In regard to locomotives, we took delivery of the 50 new EMD locomotives in December and 34 of the 100 SD90MACs that were purchased. With these efforts, service began to improve in December and will further improve into 2015, as we bring on additional T&E forces to meet growing demand. Additionally by the end of the first quarter, weather permitting, we will complete projects such as a new connection track at our 51st Street yard at Chicago and a new connection linking our terminal at Elkhart, Indiana to our line going south through Marion, Indiana. This will enable more fluid operations around one of our largest terminals, and the growing volume quarter between Chicago and Atlanta. On Slide 4, train speed data reflects the same trends of improving performance and network fluidity toward the end of the quarter. For the full fourth quarter, train speed averaged 19.7 miles per hour, with an increase in December.  On the next slide, terminal dwell averaged 29.7 hours for the full quarter. We did see improvement in December, even though average dwell is somewhat skewed due to the Christmas holiday shutdown. In the post-holiday period, we\u2019ve seen average terminal dwell continue to fall and expect that trend to continue as train operations become more consistent across the network.  A summary of key operating metrics shown on Slide 6. With a volume increase of 4% in the fourth quarter, our crew starts remain flat, the same pattern we've seen for the full year. The availability of crews created more opportunities to combine and annul trains. The impact of crew shortages and a slower velocity, particularly during the first two months of the quarter resulted in increased overtime in the fourth quarter. But as I noted earlier, we\u2019re adding nearly 400 new conductors in November and December and will be increasing the number of qualified crews over the next few months. Additionally, as our train speed continues to improve as we saw in December, we will see a decline in overtime.  Carloads per locomotive also declined due largely to an increase in light locomotive moves as we directed more power to our terminals across the northern region and increased the number of premium intermodal trains to protect service levels over the seasonal peak going into Christmas and the holidays. For the full year, carloads per locomotive was flat. In the fourth quarter, gross ton miles per gallon continued to show the improving trend we've seen through the year, down 3% over the same period last year. Improvements toward the end of the fourth quarter reflect our efforts of the last several months to increase crews, increase locomotives and implement infrastructure improvements. As you can see, these additional resources are coming on board and will continue through the first half of the year. Our customers have seen improvement in service, which will continue as operating performance improves.  Thank you. And now Marta, I will turn it over to you. Marta Stewart : Thank you Mark and good morning everyone. I\u2019ll now discuss our fourth quarter financial results, which concludes another year of record performance. I will finish with an overview of the full year financials and speak to our capital spending plan for 2015.  Slide 2 summarizes our quarterly operating results. Railway revenues as Don discussed, were about even for the quarter, while railway expenses decreased by $21 million or 1%. This resulted in record fourth quarter income from railway operations of 891 million up 1%. The operating ratio improved 40 basis points to 69.0.  The next slide shows the major components of the $21 million net decrease in expenses. Lower fuel costs as well as lower compensation and benefits were somewhat offset by increases in purchased services and rents, materials and other and depreciation. Now let's take a closer look at each of these expense categories.  As shown on Slide 4, fuel expense decreased by $56 million or 14%. For the quarter, our average price per gallon was $2.52, a 17% decline. On the consumption side, gallons used rose just 3% on the 4% growth in fourth quarter volume. As Don just showed you, the WTI forward curve is projecting further declines and we are currently paying about $1.70 a gallon. If this continues, we will see meaningful savings in the coming year, as we use about 125 million gallons of diesel fuel each quarter.  Turning next to compensation and benefits, these cost declined by a net of $47 million or 6%. Continued favorability and post-retirement medical and pension accruals, coupled with slightly lower health and welfare costs, resulted in a $47 million reduction in expense. Additionally, incentive compensation showed a relative decline of 32 million, largely due to the higher accrual level in the fourth quarter of 2013. Partly offsetting these declines were increased pay rates of $15 million, higher overtime of $11 million, and 5 million related to the temporary transfer program Mark discussed with you on last quarter\u2019s call and which was in place to increase crew availability primarily in the northern region. For 2015, we will have a higher quarterly increase related to pay rates because our labor agreements call for a wage rate increase effective January 01st instead of July 01st, as we have in the previous five years. Therefore, while each quarter of 2014 reflected about $15 million for this item, or a total of 60 million, for 2015 it will total approximately $85 million and will be weighted about two-thirds in the first half of the year.  Slide 6 depicts purchased services and rent, which were up $46 million, or 11%, largely due to higher volume-related activities, particularly in the areas of intermodal operations, equipment rents, and joint facilities. The slower network velocity Mark described also contributed to the increase. The materials and other category rose by $29 million, or 15%. About 16 million of this was due to higher casualties and other claims as the prior year, the fourth quarter of 2013, have a large favorable personal injury adjustment. In addition, $6 million of the increase is related to higher material usage. And, lastly, 2 million was due to higher T&E travel and temporary housing costs associated with the transfer program.  Turning to Slide 8, depreciation expense rose by $7 million, or 3%, which is consistent with the trend in the third quarter and is reflective of our larger capital base. That brings us to our income tax accruals and effective rate, which are shown on Slide 9. Total taxes were 279 million for an effective rate of 35.3% compared to 34.5% last year. The effective rate was somewhat lower than previous quarters of 2014, primarily due to $9 million related to tax credits in the extenders legislation which passed in December. Since the legislation was only for 2014, those credits will not benefit our 2015 tax accruals and, therefore, the effective rate in 2015 is likely to be closer to the combined federal and state statutory rate of 37.5%.  Wrapping up our quarterly overview, net income and EPS comparisons are displayed on Slide 10. Net income was 511 million, a decrease of $2 million. Diluted earnings per share were $1.64, even with the prior year and matching our all-time fourth quarter record.  Focusing next on the full-year operating results; revenues were up 3% while expenses only rose by 1%. This resulted in record operating results up 10% and an all-time best operating ratio of the 69.2. As you might expect, the record operating results also provided for record bottom-line results, as shown on the next slide. Net income for the year, depicted on the left side, was $2 billion. Excluding the large land sale that benefited 2013, net income increased 8%, which translated into a 9% increase in earnings per share to $6.39.  Moving on to cash flows, our cash from operations covered capital spending and produced 734 million in free cash flow. While the year-end tax legislation I just mentioned also extended bonus depreciation for 2014, it did so after we had made our fourth-quarter estimated tax payment. Therefore, the cash flow benefit of 2014 bonus depreciation, which amounted to approximately $250 million, will not be reflected until 2015 when we can reduce our April estimated tax payments.  Turning to shareholder returns, we distributed $687 million in dividends, reflective of the two dividend increases made in 2014. As Wick mentioned, our Board has approved another $0.02 per share dividend increase effective with our first-quarter 2015 dividend payment. In addition to the dividend, we also repurchased $318 million of stock. In 2015 we anticipate a higher level of share repurchases more in line with our average of the past five years. Our operating expectations will be supported by a robust capital program in 2015. Slide 14 shows four years of historical capital spending as well as the projection for 2015. The $2.4 billion budget is 13% higher than 2014.  Slide 15 splits our planned capital spending between core, growth, and PTC. Similar to prior years, core spending comprises about two-thirds of the total and reinvests in our track, our freight cars and our locomotives. Growth and productivity-related capital make up about a quarter of the budget, as we invest for additional volume, add locomotives, and increase track capacity.  Slide 16 provides you the detailed amounts by type of expenditure. Most are generally in line with recent years proportional spending.  In addition to the $2.4 billion capital budget, the acquisition of the DNA South assets from Canadian Pacific of approximately 215 million will also be reflected in property additions on our cash flow statement in the quarter in which that transaction closes. We believe this capital program positions us well to efficiently grow in 2015.  And with that, I thank you for your attention and I will turn the program back to Wick. Wick Moorman : Thanks, Marta. Well as you have heard, we had a good fourth quarter which capped off a very good year in spite of some of our and the industry's operating challenges. The good news for all of us is from that standpoint is that we and the other carriers seem to have turned the corner from a network velocity standpoint. And while we obviously still have a few months of winter to go, we at Norfolk Southern are confident that our metrics will continue to recover and reach their 2012-2013 levels by the second half of 2015. From a business standpoint, our outlook is positive but there are clearly some question marks out there. As you\u2019ve heard from Don, coal remains something of a wild card for us with continued weakness in the international markets and natural gas currently in the $3 range. It\u2019s also unclear how the effects of lower oil prices will play out. Obviously the reductions in lower fuel -- will result in lower fuel expenses for us and should provide an additional boost to segments of the economy that can generate more traffic for NS. However, our revenues from fuel surcharges will also be considerably lower, and it may well result in slower growth in the energy-related segments of our traffic base, including frac sand and crude oil.  Quite frankly, neither we nor anyone else we know of understand exactly how this will all play out, but we are obviously watching it closely and are ready to respond to whatever happens to the best of our ability. The end of day, our strategy remains the same, do our very best to operate an efficient, high-velocity railroad, which enables us to offer the best possible customer service and retain and grow business at rates that provide a superior return for our owners. That's easy to say, but as 2014 proved not always easy to do. But Norfolk Southern has the best team in the business and I am very confident in our ability to reach that level again quickly and stay there.  Thanks and I will turn it back to the operator for your questions. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Bill Greene : Wick and Mark I wanted to ask you about costs, because in the past we have seen Norfolk tend to want to keep some of the resources in place a bit longer to maintain the service when volumes start to grow. Obviously we\u2019ve been in a period of strong volumes and the service hasn't quite been there, so if volumes this year turn out to be less than expected, how much of the cost structure is kind of fixed? How much could you go back and touch? Or are we kind of in a world where, no, given the service challenges, we're going to hold this regardless kind of what volume does? Wick Moorman : Well Bill one thing we can react to pretty quickly is we can dial back on our crews. As far as locomotives we've kind of got what we've got, but I think it was very beneficial that we got these 100 SD90MACs, so that was not as expensive a play as far as the locomotive to go. And then as far as cost go, so much of this has to do with what's baked into our operation from a productivity standpoint and these big projects we\u2019ve had that you are familiar with over the last particularly two or three years, where our leader continues to rollout, movement planner continues to rollout, we will complete our last division in February, all the benefits we're getting from our productivity projects in our terminals with engaged, similar type projects with insight in our locomotive shops, all those things continue to actually lower our cost structure. So we will keep a really close eye on it. And we think we can dial things back if things are not as robust going forward. Bill Greene : Don or even Wick if you have a view on this too, obviously the fuel surcharges have been a focus. Given the way you've sort of constructed yours and a number of contracts being WTI-based, is there an opportunity here or even a desire to shift that more toward the on-highway diesel to better match revenue and costs, so that we don't have mismatches of this of this magnitude? Don Seale : Good morning, Bill. As you mentioned in your question, most of these fuel surcharge components are embedded in contracts so it would take us some time to convert overtime. We continue to look at the various formulas that we apply in the marketplace. We have done that over time. We will continue to do that, but there are no plans in the immediate sense to convert from WTI to on-highway diesel. We continue to look at it and, as contracts expire, we will continue to look at that and assess it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Allison Landry of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Allison Landry : Good morning, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask a question about the decline in coal yields and if you could maybe give us a breakdown of how much was mix versus lower fuel surcharges versus price. And if that included any rate cuts on the export side? Don Seale : Good morning, Allison. This is Don. I can assure you there has been no price adjustment on the export; the mix and the fuel are the two highlights of the decline. Let me address mix. As I pointed out in my comments, export shipments were down 25% in the quarter. Those are our longest-haul, highest RPU coal shipments, but we also had negative mix within export as our Lambert\u2019s Point pier, which is the longest of the long-haul, was down about 32% in volume while our shorter-haul export traffic at the port of Baltimore was up 5%. So we had negative mix within the export segment.  And then within utility we had some partial offset. Our northern utility tonnage was off a little bit more than our south. We were down 9% in the North and 1% in the South, and then fuel was the remaining component of the offset. Allison Landry : Okay. That's very helpful, thanks. And I just wanted to ask, you did mention expectations for solid growth as it relates to NGLs and frac sand in the Marcellus and Utica. Are you -- I guess are you getting a little bit more cautious just given where gas prices are and the rig counts that are falling? I know that right now it seems like the Marcellus and Utica are more insulated than some of the oil plays, but how are you thinking about that for 2015? Don Seale : Allison, that\u2019s a good question and gas continues to be disconnected from oil in terms of the marketplace. Low gas prices, as we pointed out, puts pressure on our utility coal market, but we expect the Marcellus/Utica region for frac sand, pipe inputs, as well as natural gas liquid outputs, to continue to be rather strong this year. The outlook on oil is a little more problematic as the spreads have collapsed and in January we\u2019ve seen Brent actually for a day or two move below the WTI levels. So as long as we see oil in that below $50 range, and spreads that are very close or nonexistent, crude by rail from the West will be more problematic than it was 60 days or 90 days ago. Operator : Next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Tom Wadewitz : Good morning. And Don, I just wanted to say it\u2019s been a pleasure working with you over the years and wish you the best in retirement. Don Seale : Thank you, Tom. Tom Wadewitz : On the surcharge topic, is there a framework you can give us to think about this? Because I think the sense is that you are probably a bit over covered, maybe partly due to WTI, maybe due to just the way some of the contracts work, and there is somewhat of an operating income headwind as well as lower revenue. Is there any way you can frame that? Should we look back maybe to 2009 and use that framework for maybe the change in revenue versus change in expense? Or how would you want us to think about how large that headwind is from the operating income headwind from lower surcharge in 2015? Don Seale : Tom, looking at 2015 specifically, as I mentioned, our fuel surcharge revenue generated in 2014 was $1.3 billion. If you look at the formulas we have, about half are WTI based and about half are on-highway diesel. And about two-thirds, as I mentioned, of the WTI based are out of the money right now with oil below $50. The other third will continue to generate fuel surcharge revenue this year, as will the on-highway diesel fuel surcharge revenues. So if you put all that together, I would tell you that we expect fuel surcharge revenue slightly below 50% of what we collected last year. Tom Wadewitz : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. How do you think about the -- second question, how do you think about the utility coal sensitivity to gas price? I am wondering what percent of your coal consumption would be in the PJM region or I don\u2019t know if you would call that Mid-Atlantic. But what percent of your coal consumption is there and how much risk do you think there might be at current gas prices of switching really taking your -- taking coal tons away from you? Don Seale : Let me frame your question Tom which should be helpful to you and others on the call. Our utility coal business was down about 3.5 million tons for the entire year for 2014. And that was after a market share shift in the North that we talked about, which is about 5.5 million tons of loss for 2014, so we actually had on the margin a small improvement in overall utility tonnage, but I will tell you natural gas prices that are now 285 per million BTU in that range puts a lot of stress on our coal utility plants in the North in close proximity to the Marcellus and Utica gas production fields, where gas is trading well below the 285.  In the Southeast, the southern portion of our utility fleet, we also see fairly significant pressures on our utility coal burn as a result of gas being that low. So the North is more pressured with respect to proximity and lower spot gas prices, but the South has competitive pressure as well when gas is below $3. Tom Wadewitz : Can you give a rough sense of the mix between what's North and what's South? Don Seale : In the year, we were slightly over 50% in the North on tonnage, like 52-48. Operator : Our next question is from the line of John Barnes with RBC. Please proceed with your question. John Barnes : In looking at your CapEx outlook for 2015, you highlight the rebuild program and the used locomotive program. Just curious with EMD out of the market, how long are those programs, the rebuild and the used program, a sufficient band-aid to cover your locomotive needs? And especially if you get any material volume growth again this year, I know coal is weak, but in the other commodities, how long can that serve as a band-aid until EMD is back in the market? Mark Manion : I really don\u2019t -- this is Mark, I don't think about it as a band-aid and keeping in mind that at this point, we are figuring on a steady state of at least 50 locomotives a year and after a couple of years we\u2019ll even increase beyond that, so that is very helpful to us. And then we just got 50 new locomotives in the last year and like I said the 100 SD90MACs coming up, that's going to cover us very nicely for 2015. And then we've got space reserved for purchases in the two years beyond that, so we are in good shape for locomotives. John Barnes : And then turning on the pricing side for intermodal, truckload rates should move higher. Even though they are experiencing a decline in fuel surcharge, there's some talk about capturing some of that in coal rates. Do you think the outlook for intermodal pricing is similar, that you ought to be able to replace some of the lost fuel surcharge with an increase in base rates? And is this a year where maybe there is the potential to close the gap between truckload and intermodal pricing? Don Seale : John this is Don. The first part of your question absolutely, we see an opportunity based on tight transportation capacity in the truckload market and across other modes of transportation that sets up a good, solid opportunity for improved pricing across our intermodal book. You will see the results of that in our ARPU as we go through the year, but that will be offset somewhat by lower fuel surcharges, we may not be able to capture all of the delta in the base rate, but we will make a more substantial headway this year in improving base rates in intermodal. Operator : Next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Chris Wetherbee : Mark just wanted to touch back onto the service side. Just kind of get a rough sense of maybe what type of cost was allocated maybe to service issues in the fourth quarter, if you could highlight that? And then as we think about 2015, assuming nothing major from a weather event and obviously there might be some issues in the East Coast in the next couple of days, but as you think about the outlook for 2015, how should that recovery progress as you get these crews back online? When do you think you kind of have service back towards levels that we saw maybe a year or two ago? Mark Manion : Yes Chris let me take that question and then I'm going to turn it over to Marta to put some more numbers on that, but as we go forward, the way I\u2019m thinking about it is, we have managed to hang onto the recovery that we started with back at the end of the fourth quarter, that's been good. Hopefully we can continue to do that, so the way second quarter shapes up we\u2019ll depend on how the rest of the winter goes, but I\u2019m thinking of the second quarter in terms of improvement over where we are right now. And very much as we go into the second half, I\u2019m thinking of us being back to our old selves in terms of higher velocity, which is certainly going to help cost fallout. So as I think about 2015, I think we\u2019ll not see extraordinary just due to the fact that we are ramping up.  Marta, can you put some numbers on that? Marta Stewart : Yes, I can. In the fourth quarter, Chris, there was a number of pieces I mentioned. If you put them all together, the service cost comes to about $35 million. I mentioned the $11 million in overtime, the $5 million of temporary transfers that we had that was in comp and benefits, and then in materials I mentioned $6 million of increased materials usage. And the final piece is in purchased services and rents. That was up due to volume, but there was a service component to it of about $12 million. The last piece I mentioned was in the other category, the travel for the temporary transfers. So if you put all that together it's about $35 million of additional costs in the fourth quarter. Chris Wetherbee : Okay, that\u2019s great. That\u2019s really helpful. And then just circling back to the fuel surcharge component, I guess I am just trying to understand sort of maybe why there isn\u2019t more of a push to move towards the diesel-based or on-highway diesel-based fuel surcharge programs. It would seem like that would be maybe a better match to the input cost. I guess I am just kind of curious why that wouldn\u2019t be something that you would be thinking about doing over the course of the next couple of years as these contracts come up for renewal. Don Seale : First and foremost, as I mentioned earlier, it\u2019s the fact that we have to cycle through contracts to be able to make those changes. We are -- we will continue to assess whether or not we want to make those changes when we negotiate with our customers, but first and foremost it\u2019s a timing issue. Chris Wetherbee : Okay, but it is something that you would consider I guess going down the road here? Don Seale : Well, the fact that we are at 50% of our surcharges are on-highway diesel shows you that -- demonstrates that we have been moving in that direction. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Thomas Kim, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question. Thomas Kim : Good morning. Thanks for your time. I just wanted to ask on the export side for coal, I presume the 3 million in coal royalties is primarily related to that. And I guess should -- and please correct me if I am wrong there. And I am wondering is that rate in the fourth quarter something that we should be sort of looking forward to as sort of the run rate for \u201915, bearing in mind that it does seem like the run rate in the fourth quarter was slower than what we have seen in the first nine months of \u201914. Thanks. Don Seale : Good morning. Of course the export coal does not have a royalty revenue associated with it. This would be Pocahontas Land, which is our energy subsidiary in West Virginia that has coal leases to coal operators. And that would continue to -- that is recurring income based on coal production and coal volumes. Thomas Kim : Great, thanks for the clarification there. And then just with regard to the overall export volumes in coal, the fourth quarter did show some further deterioration in the absolute tonnage. If we were to annualize that for 2015, we would be looking at sort of a similar decline for the year, call it about 18% or so. Do you think that is a fair assumption or could you give us some color as to what sort of export coal tonnage we should be anticipating for the year? Don Seale : Let me frame your question just looking back. We saw our export volume in \u201914 fall from 28 million to 23 million tons. In that marketplace in \u201914, we saw the thermal market to Northern Europe declined from the mid-70s all the way down to under 60 now on the API2, $60 a ton. That is well below the cost of production for most or all of Central App producers, so our producers that have historically moved thermal coal to Northern Europe are out of the money with respect to production cost.  And also on met coal we saw continued softness in the world settlement price, below $120 per ton, and we saw Australia continuing to increase production as well as watching their currency weaken against the dollar, which gives them a further cost advantage. So 2015 is shaping up to be a very challenging year for export coal. I won't go out on a limb and tell you how much we actually expect, but we don\u2019t expect it to be strong. Operator : Next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Brandon Oglenski : Good morning, everyone. Wick, it seems like we come back to this question quite a bit, but for investors this is all a relative game, right? So I think when we were at your analyst meeting last year you talked about how Norfolk has targets to really improve profitability right along with the rest of the industry, but obviously you guys don\u2019t provide any specific forward guidance. But today it seems like the call has been focused on a lot of negatives here. You still have lingering service challenges this year. You have higher capital spending, increased coal headwinds. You have the whole issue with the surcharge mismatch right now. So, what\u2019s the risk here that 2015 really shows a slowing in the margin improvement? Is this an event here where we see very robust volume demand across the industry, and yet, because of the specific issues at Norfolk, we can\u2019t get a lot of earnings expansion or keep up on a relative basis? Or am I thinking about this too negatively? Wick Moorman : Well, I think that you are a little negative on that, Brandon. I think that if you kind of look at the positives, the first is we are clearly in an economy that continues to expand. And the negatives that can go along with the decrease in crude oil prices and fuel surcharge decreases are countered by the fact that I think we\u2019re going to see strong economic growth. And that\u2019s going to drive some segments of our business that are very profitable for us and where we can continue to make volume and margin headway.  The second thing I think that\u2019s important is that, we and a lot of the rest of the industry in 2014 really did labor under operating challenges. We feel as Mark has told you, a lot better about where we are operationally. We have more to do, more resources that are coming on, but resources that aren't going to add a lot to our overall cost structure. And as you look back at 2014 and you look at not only the expenses that we incurred but, quite frankly there are some places where we could have handled more volume had the network operated a higher velocity. I think we have a lot of positives in that regard as well. Mark mentioned that we\u2019re optimistic that we are going to be back, certainly by the second half in terms of the operation of railroad and we're going to improve throughout the first half. So I think that -- I think there are a lot of positives that we\u2019re looking at in 2015. Clearly there are headwinds and we want to be upfront about those headwinds, but as I said at the beginning I am optimistic that we are going to have a good year in 2015. Don Seale : Brandon this is Don. I would just add to that too that, if you look at the latest quarter, it\u2019s instructional with respect to the pending improvement in our network performance. If you break down our fourth quarter and we don't normally do this by month, but I will do this here. If you look at our volume increases in October, we increased volume by 2% year-over-year, albeit against a strong comp from last year. November, at the bottom of our overall service performance metrics, our volume was flat. And then in December coming off the network reset after the Thanksgiving holiday and with the improved operation after that reset through December, our volumes were up 9%. Our December was much stronger with respect to volume and revenue than the prior two months. And the only reason I'm going through that data is just to point you toward the strength in our network with respect to overall demand for merchandise and intermodal and coal that was deferred, when we generate better cycle times and improve velocity in this network, which we saw in December. Brandon Oglenski : Well I don't want to put words in your all's mouth here, but does it sound like that the positives offset the headwinds and that we\u2019re focused on this morning, on channel? Wick Moorman : Well Brandon I would certainly say on balance that, we think so. We certainly hope so. 2015 has got a long way to go and we\u2019re not sure what\u2019s going to happen in a lot of sectors, but right now as I said, we remain optimistic. We do have some headwinds but we have got a lot of positives in front of us as well. Brandon Oglenski : And just one more Don by the way congrats on retirement here, I'm sure you'll be happy not to take any more coal questions going forward. Well if I can just get one last one in then, we've talked a lot about it here, but what is the actual outlook for utility and export coal in 2015? Should we be expecting -- I think in the past you\u2019re talking about 1% to 2% decline from MATS, but has that outlook deteriorated just with where natural gas prices are in the discussion we\u2019ve already had? Don Seale : Brandon the outlook on utility coal with respect to MATS is the same as what we talked about last fall at our Investor Day Conference. Nothing has changed there. Natural gas prices have trended lower. The forward curve is lower. That will put as we have already said additional pressure on our utility coal burn at our utilities. The question Mark is whether or not gas will stay low all year, and we just have to wait and see that. With respect to export, the metrics for export thermal as well as metallurgical coal are not good. And we\u2019ll have to see if those change, but we don't see any drivers in the world market that would change that at this point. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question. Bascome Majors : Don since you like coal questions so much, I've got another one for you here. At a really high level, I know we've talked about it lot, but there's a lot of concern out there from investors that that 2015 in coal could be a repeat of 2012 and that's understandable given the weather, natural gas prices and the export headwinds that you've talked about at length already today. But the supply side today is also a little bit different there. Can you talk a little bit -- do you think you and your coal customers are better equipped today versus coal headwinds than 2012? And maybe why or why not? Don Seale : I think we\u2019re equipped with respect to handling the demand and also the cyclical nature of demand in 2015. Should we see the rest of the winter extremely cold, we are having a storm in the Northeast as we speak that\u2019s bringing something called winter weather, cold and snow, to that area and that will increase electricity demand. Demand in electricity in our service territory for all of 2014 fell by 1%, even with the polar vortex in the first quarter. So we don\u2019t know how cold the rest of the winter is going to be or how hot the summer is going to be, and I will tell you those two unknowns are a big component of what utility will actually do for 2015. I think we are better positioned to handle spikes in demand than we were last year. Our crew base is stronger. Our locomotive fleet is stronger. Our network is more resilient. So I am optimistic that if we see opportunities ahead that are driven by those short-term spikes or changes, we will be able to take advantage of it. Bascome Majors : And can you give us the latest sense of stockpiles from your customers in each region? What are you hearing today? Don Seale : We were down about 18% going into the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter, including December, was relatively mild and even with some of the deferred tons that we didn\u2019t deliver, our stockpiles now are close to normal in the North and close to normal in the South. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Justin Long, of Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Justin Long : Thanks and good morning. You gave some helpful color on fuel surcharge and the potential revenue headwind this year, but just to be clear on the potential earnings impact, if WTI and fuel prices continue to trend in line I guess with the forward curve, what\u2019s the operating income headwind you expect in 2015, all else being equal? Marta Stewart : I think, as Don said, and the amount that he said where it could be half of what it was last year is based on the prices that we are seeing now, the current prices. So if you take that same viewpoint of current prices in our fuel expense, you can see the gallons that we burn on average per quarter. And to get a point estimate you would take the current price, and as I said we are paying $1.70 a gallon, so I think you could model it out.  If it changes, I think we would like to give it in those kinds of pieces because Don has given you what would happen if prices stay where they are now and I have given you what the pieces would be if prices stay now. So that way if the amounts -- if either of those change, you can forecast the two pieces separately. Justin Long : Okay, fair enough. And second question on service. As we think about the potential for a gradual service recovery that could occur over the course of the year, is there any way to frame up how significant a one mile per hour improvement in velocity on the network could be for the business, whether it\u2019s the additional capacity it creates for volumes, the cost savings, or some other way to think about the financial impact? Mark Manion : This is Mark. One thing that comes into play is that it affects our locomotive fleet. And our analysis on that reveals that for every mile an hour you get about a 70 locomotive, 75 locomotive benefit from that. And then, from the standpoint of just pure improvement that we get from velocity, of course some of our costs drop off. We see the number of re-crews go down, so we don\u2019t have that expense. We see reduction in our overtime. And beyond that it just frees up the network to where we just run so much more fluidly and that\u2019s just got various benefit to it.  So, barring an unusual winter, I would think we could get an additional mile per hour. We are bumping around 21 miles an hour right now, and I am hopeful that we could get another mile per hour out of that in the second quarter. And then, like I said, return to more historical good times in the second half. Operator : Our next question is from the lien of Matt Troy, Nomura. Please proceed with your question. Matt Troy : Great, thank you. Just a question on service. You covered it, I think, from the cost side, but if we wanted to be a little bit more conservative in our outlook, maybe in light of the current storm heading into the Northeast. Could you just talk about what areas of the network are a little bit more sensitive or where you might be a little bit more focused and vulnerable through the balance of winter? Don Seale : Well, our line between Chicago and New Jersey, of course is our heaviest mainline, and we can have over a 100 trains a day running over portions of that area. And so, particularly in the face of storms that\u2019s where we can see challenges, that's where we definitely saw challenges in the third quarter, particularly in that Chicago to Cleveland area. So in light of that, what we are actually -- what we have actually done is we\u2019ve shifted some of our volume onto other lanes. And we are helping ourselves in that regard. And so, even in-spite of the fact that additional resources applied to that area, the fact that we have unloaded a little bit of that tonnage, we think will be helpful as well and you put all that together and we\u2019re optimistic going forward. Wick Moorman : Let me add to that though from a macro standpoint, clearly the area that it's not just Norfolk Southern that we\u2019re almost vulnerable to is disruption in Chicago. It\u2019s -- we interchange so much traffic there, as do all of the carriers that prolonged bad weather in that part of the railroad as Mark says is problematic. We\u2019ve done a lot to try to mitigate the potential downsides of that. The other carriers have as well, but that\u2019s the place where the industry is still clearly most vulnerable. As I say not from a single bad storm, we've seen some bad weather already in the first couple of weeks of the year up in that part of the world and it didn't help, but it hasn't had a whole lot of lingering bad effect. But if we saw something like we saw last year in terms of just a ongoing series of storms, that\u2019s when I think we would all really have to scramble. Matt Troy : I guess my second question would be for Don and Don again congratulations echoing the earlier comments. Just one last one on coal, I'd like to take the question from a different way. If I look at an export market that was 23 million tons and is a run-rate that's maybe 20% off that based on more recent volumes. I guess if you look at all the pricing metrics and the competitive factors, why did any of that coal need to move? I mean how much of it is under contract? But if I did look at the outline, why should we think of any of it needing to move at such structurally depressed prices where U.S. coal is not relevant in global markets? Don Seale : Well part of that is that we do have some contracted coal and our suppliers have that contracted coal. The other is that our suppliers are running mines with an intent to keep those mines in production to bridge to a point in the marketplace, which now looks like it could be 2016 at the earliest, before that market starts to turn and pricing starts to move up in the world markets. So part of it is suppliers with contracts. The other part, a larger part are suppliers that are staying in those markets to have a place at the table and to keep their employees at work and keep production going until they can get better prices. Matt Troy : I guess I was just trying to ask a long way of how much do you have under contract and visibility in 2015 on a percentage base? Is that something you could dimensionalize? Don Seale : Our metallurgical coal in the fourth quarter and I will give you this as an example with 80% of our export, we only had 20% of our volume that was thermal. And the contracts that we have are in the thermal side and not a significant portion of the thermal. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please ask your questions. Scott Group : I\u2019ll try and ask two quick ones. Don when you add up all the moving parts the fuel, the volume, growth, pricing getting better, do you think you\u2019ll see revenue growth this year? Don Seale : We do. That\u2019s the short answer. Scott Group : Is there a longer answer? Or -- Don Seale : No, no I think your question is a good one. We expect revenue growth in 2015. We expect as we indicated in the remarks, our merchandise business is continues to be strong and I\u2019d just remind everybody how strong that merchandise segment was in the fourth quarter of \u201813. I would look at the comps and look at the growth on top of those strong comps in the fourth quarter. So we expect that to continue. It may be mitigated somewhat with energy-related commodities that are a little bit weaker, but we\u2019ve fundamentally strong merchandise franchise.  And then I look at this maybe a little biased, but we have the best intermodal network in the East. And we\u2019ve invested in that intermodal network. And the time for growth is now and the time for margin expansion is now. Scott Group : It sounds like between volume and then maybe price offsetting mix is enough to get you to positive revenue? Don Seale : We\u2019re confident that that will be the case. Scott Group : And then just one for Marta. I know you talked about ramping up the buyback this year back to historical levels, can you give us a little color on what you mean by that? We've got a couple years of $2 billion of buyback, some years $1.3 billion, 2013 with $600 million, so what kind of range were you thinking with that comment? Marta Stewart : Right, if you look over our last five years, the average -- you're right it has gone a bit up and down, but over the last five years it averages a little over $1 billion. Scott Group : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of John Larkin with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. John Larkin : Good morning, everybody, and thanks for taking my question. Maybe this is for Wick. Given that Don has been such a consummate professional for so many years could you maybe share with us the thought process of replacing him? I assume the replacement will come from an internal person, but perhaps you could illuminate us a little bit in that area? Wick Moorman : Well, I think all I can really say is that we are obviously looking our hand over and we are talking with our Board, which ultimately makes or helps us make decisions like this. We look forward to coming up with a replacement candidate in the fairly near future. I will say that, in some ways, Don is irreplaceable, particularly his patience in answering questions about coal. But, no, we are on track to name a new Chief Marketing Officer in the fairly near future. John Larkin : Thanks for that. Then maybe just a question on the capital program that Marta reviewed earlier. I was a little surprised to see a large freight car program of -- I think it's 404 million. Usually over the years I think the freight car percentage of the total has been a little lower than that. Can you give us some color on where that money is going to be spent, given that so many of the cars that are employed in the new energy business are typically leased cars or shipper-owned cars? Marta Stewart : John, you're absolutely right that that is a little bit of a higher percentage than we have had in the recent years. One of the reasons why is exactly what John just talked about; is expected growth in our intermodal market. So we've got some containers and chassis that we will be purchasing. In addition, he talked about the automotive sector and how strong we think that's going to be for us, so we've got bi-levels and tri-levels in there and we've also got coil cars. So it is to replace -- those are the growth that I mentioned and it's also to replace other units that are either coming due for their normal capital replacement or that we are going to capital instead of leasing. So we've got growth and replacement in there. Wick Moorman : I think that -- to add a little bit to what Marta said, which is exactly right, when we look at our freight car fleet -- and we have some components of it in addition to our coal hopper fleet that are aging -- and we look at our business prospects, we really fundamentally believe that when we see the need for car types where we know we are going to be in that business for a long time. It's good business for us and business that doesn't fluctuate wildly over a cycle. It makes more economic sense for us, if we have capability to do so, to buy rather than lease. We are constantly doing those types of economic analyses. And in these cases we feel that it is better business and offers ultimately a higher return for us to buy the cars rather than leasing, as we might have in the past. But that is not, we feel, the best thing. John Larkin : Thanks for the color. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead with your question. Jason Seidl : Thank you. I guess I will first start off by saying, Don, you will definitely be missed and best of luck in retirement. I guess I will switch it up a little bit since it's late in the call. You guys mentioned that there was some shutdowns and some retooling in some of your auto plants and that you are expecting a pretty strong 2015. Based on the fact that some of the shutdowns and retooling were in the fourth quarter, should we expect some of the strength to be front-end-loaded in the year? Don Seale : Jason, this is Don. We will see ramp up volumes of the F-150 for Ford, for example, out of Kansas City. That was one of the plants. The new Transit at Kansas City, which is a van, also ramping up and then, of course, General Motors at Wentzville, Missouri, also ramping up. So we will see some front-end loaded growth and growth throughout the year though from those plants that I'm mentioning. Jason Seidl : Okay. And I will switch my second question here to intermodal. Obviously this issue that has been going on with the West Coast ports pretty much since July, is there any way to quantify a benefit that Norfolk might've seen from that, if any? Don Seale : It's not very easy to quantify the exact benefit. We have seen more all-water service coming to the East Coast ports, but, frankly, we had seen that pattern develop over the last five, six years. So our East Coast ports are busy. They probably are on the margin busier than they would have been had the ILWU negotiations not impacted West Coast port operations. But what we are seeing in our international growth more fundamentally than that, is new accounts and new services, one of which I will mention is the South Carolina Inland Port at Greer, South Carolina. That\u2019s ramped up and continues to grow. And our Heartland Corridor and terminal projects associated with the other corridors have helped us continue to grow our business with new accounts in the international space. Jason Seidl : So, Don do you think, given all the issues the West Coast port has had now and then even a couple years back and the projections for ramping up a lot of East Coast ports to handle larger ships, do you think some of these wins can be sticky for the East Coast? Don Seale : I think the larger ships that are continuing to come online that are coming to the East Coast ports already through the Suez Canal, that\u2019s something that\u2019s notable and certainly sticky. That will continue. The Panama Canal has been delayed, as we know, into \u201816. But the Suez Canal, as we have said all along, because of the shifting nature of international freight origins in Asia from China back toward Vietnam and Malaysia et cetera, we are already seeing those large ships come to the East Coast ports. And we expect that to continue. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman, Buckingham Research. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Kauffman : Thank you very much. Thank you for taking my question. Congratulations, Don, and best of luck. Don Seale : Thank you Jeff. Jeff Kauffman : Let me also ask you a question on your way out. If you had to guess how much business the railroad did not do because of service congestion, service issues, and I'm thinking more specifically intermodal, but I will leave it open -- how much business do you think the company could do next year if service levels normalize and you get some of that business back? Don Seale : We certainly will do more business because our fleets, our equipment fleets have better capacity when we turn them at a faster pace. Certainly we believe we could have handled more volume in 2014, and the numbers that I walk through earlier in the call just in the fourth quarter demonstrates that with 9% growth in December alone in terms of overall volume versus pretty much flat volume growth in October/November. So we will see more business because demand is strong and we expect that demand to continue to be strong. Wick mentioned the consumer market benefiting from lower gasoline prices. We think that will certainly have an impact on overall demand in intermodal.  And also the strong dollar, while it is a headwind for exports, it will definitely be a tailwind for imports, and again, our international business will benefit from that. And turning the equipment faster gives us more capacity, generates better customer satisfaction, and also supports our pricing negotiations. Jeff Kauffman : Should I think of the D&H acquisition as more of a revenue opportunity or an optimization opportunity? Wick Moorman : I think you would think of it as both. We have been a substantial user of the D&H for some time now as one of our major routes to access New England, along with the Pan Am Southern. We do believe that we will be able to some extent to streamline and improve our operations as a result of this. But we also have done a careful analysis of the market and do see increased revenue opportunities, so we think that from both standpoints it\u2019s a good deal for us. Jeff Kauffman : Okay, and last follow-up with Marta. Marta along the lines of the question I asked Don, you outlined about $35 million of congestion related costs that you believe occurred in the fourth quarter. As the service levels do normalize and the miles per hour go up and some of the older locomotives can be put down, overtime is not being paid, what do you think congestion costs you all-in in 2014? Marta Stewart : Well, that\u2019s a good question. In 2014 and we talked about some of the pieces on each of the calls. In the first quarter we had a weather related impact that we talked about, first quarter 2014, that was 45 million. And then in the second and third quarter we talked about service impacts that were about 25 million a quarter and then this one, as I said, is about 35 million.  So we had weather first and then we had some degree of service related, most of it is related to velocity, as you would expect additional costs. So going into 2015, as Mark said, we are hopeful that we are going to gradually improve through the first two quarters. So we will still see some of that, some of those costs in the first couple of quarters we think. And we will also have, as he mentioned, the fact that we have additional employees that we got in the fourth quarter, those will carry forward and we are continuing to add employees in 2015. So you are going to see the costs that are related to service I would say front-end loaded in 2015 and then gradually the overtime, the extra materials, the extra purchased services due to velocity work themselves off in the latter half of the year. Operator : Our next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein Investment Research. Please go ahead with your question. David Vernon : Maybe Don or Mark a question for you on capacity within the intermodal network. Are you guys sort of thinking about -- could you talk a little bit about how you guys are thinking about the growth opportunity on the domestic highway conversion and whether you will be adding any new train starts or new services within the intermodal network this year? And what kind of room you have to actually take new volume growth? Don Seale : This is Don. In terms of our network capacity for domestic intermodal and also international, we\u2019ve invested in the terminals and the corridors to the extent that we have capacity in the network to grow in a significant way. Certainly the train service plan is set for 2015. And if we see that demand changing or enhancing or growing beyond that, we may look at new trains, but at this point we don't see a need for significant new train service in the network. We will continue with our densification program and stacking programs to generate more boxes per train to the point that they reach a length of train that we decide to add a section to it, but all of that said, we have capacity in the network without adding anything right now. David Vernon : Maybe and then just as a quick follow-up Marta, question for you on some of the non-operating stuff. We had about $150 million a $0.30 tailwind from the pension and post-retirement stuff this year. Is there anything else like that that we should be aware of from a modeling perspective for 2015? Is there any sort of large one-time non-operating items that we should be putting into our estimates? Marta Stewart : No in that area pension and post-retirement, you're right, we had that big decline 2014 over \u201813. But the accruals for pension and post-retirement, which are in compensation and benefits, those are expected to be flat in 2015 versus 2014. David Vernon : And there's no other sort of non-operating stuff that we should be -- that we should have on our radar? Marta Stewart : No. As you know, our non-operating items include the coal royalties that Don mentioned earlier and also include real-estate sales and those if you look historically, those are lumpy, but right now we don't have anything that we\u2019re anticipating that\u2019s going to make that significantly different from 2014. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question. Ken Hoexter : If I can just kind of follow-up maybe on the fuel surcharge programs, I just want to understand, maybe clarify some comments earlier to build the start of the call, you mentioned no plans to convert from WTI to on-highway and then to Chris later on you noted it\u2019s a timing issue and you will consider it. Can you just state, why wouldn't you clearly state that every contract going forward at least would be discussed or converted from WTI onto on-highway diesel in the contract? Wick Moorman : Ken we plan to make the best business decision with those negotiations for each contract, so we wouldn't want to say one way or the other, but we\u2019re certainly open to it and it will be part of our negotiations and we\u2019ll make the best business decision for us going forward. Ken Hoexter : And then on the CapEx, question for Mark. Just with service rebounding, as you accelerate CapEx 15%, could that impact your service improvements at all? Does it accelerate it? Does it slow it down in instances where you need to make capacity investments? And then thoughts on the D&H, does that fit in there at all as well in terms of accelerating any of the service rebounds? Mark Manion : Well in terms of -- I presume you're talking about infrastructure improvement, is that right Ken? Ken Hoexter : Yes. Mark Manion : Yes. And I've talked about that on these calls before how very beneficial that is and we have been spending for going back probably 10 years, more than 10 years now, it's that approximately $50 million a year. And like I\u2019ve said in a very surgical way where we've got the tools these days to look out to see where the capacity needs are. And we've got a bundle of infrastructure improvement projects that are teed up right now. They are always rolling out of the pipeline and they continue to be very beneficial to the overall operation, so that is part of what will get us improved velocity as we go forward this year and after that. Ken Hoexter : So as the investments come on, you don't see it impacting your slow, steady improvement comment earlier? Mark Manion : I do see it positively impacting us Ken. For example, and the Bellevue project is well outside of what I was talking about with the surgical projects that I referred to, but Bellevue for example, as beneficial as that was and when we turned that on in the second half, we saw big improvements to that, but the reality is we have only implemented half of the operating changes related to Bellevue. So more to come and in fact we will implement the rest of that around the end of this first quarter. So improvements from that, improvements from a variety of other projects that -- not necessarily real big, but the key cumulative effect is very positive. Ken Hoexter : Appreciate the insight. I could just wrap up, my favorite Don statement years ago was we were in a hot hotel room conference room at the end and he said, just helping coal out, leave your air conditioning on when you leave the hotel rooms to help burn more coal. So, Don, appreciate the thoughts over the years. Don Seale : Ken, it works good with heat as well. Leave your windows open. Thanks, Ken. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Don Broughton with Avondale. Please go ahead with your question. Don Broughton : Most of my questions have been answered. I had one little housekeeping thing. Marta, you said that because of the timing of the renewal of bonus depreciation you were going to recognize a catch-up in Q1 for 2014. In order to properly model, what is the nominal amount of that catch-up? Marta Stewart : And that is a cash one. I don't know if I was completely clear on that. That is a cash effect so we already recorded the deferred tax proportion related to that in the fourth quarter, but we made our estimated surplus paying your taxes ahead of time. So cash effect. Don Broughton : Perfect, that's perfect sense. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please go ahead with your question. Cherilyn Radbourne : Thanks very much and good morning. I wonder if you could, as your peers have done, give us a sense of your total exposure to crude by rail, frac sand, and pipe, either as a percentage of total revenue or a percentage of total volume. Don Seale : Yes, good morning, this is Don. Our crude oil based on the actual loads handled in 2014 was a little less than 1.5% of our volume for the year. If we factor in the natural gas liquids and Marcellus, Utica inputs and outputs, including natural gas liquids, and put it with crude, it is a total of 3%. Cherilyn Radbourne : Okay, that's very helpful. Then just in terms of network performance; clearly that was a challenge all year, but particularly in November and December it looked like those were very challenging months, then followed by some good improvement in December. Can you just talk a little bit about what made October and November so challenging and then the reset that you did post-Thanksgiving? Don Seale : Sure, I'd be glad to. As we got into the third quarter that was the point of the year in 2014 where we had the lowest crew base, keeping in mind that as we finished the tough first quarter of 2014 and velocity was not good due to all those weather challenges, we did get a surge in volume. And the surge in volume was -- it was in some specific areas, mostly in our northern region, and as we got those volumes and were pretty well keeping up with them through the summer, but as we got deeper into the third quarter those volumes were still up there and that is when we hit the trough as far as the lowest point of our crude base. You may recall that we had a temporary transfer program where we sent about 120 conductors up into that northern region. It was extremely helpful, but again, we had to paddle hard in order to keep up with it, so that's why we were up against some pretty difficult situations and got into some congestion in that October/November range. But then, as we have been saying, the resources, particularly the crews, those people that we hired right after the end of the bad winter, they became -- they started becoming available in bigger numbers in November and that is when we saw our improvement. And Don referred to the reset. It's nothing magical, but simply put, with the advantage of those resources, the additional conductors in November with the advantage of some additional locomotive power we had we took advantage of lower volumes that come on each year that we experience each year around the Thanksgiving holiday. Customers aren't loading as much freight, so we took advantage of those lower volumes and those increased resources to what we call reset the network. And at a point in time at all of our terminals, we come out of the gate with an on-time railroad and we were able to sustain that, so it has been very helpful. Cherilyn Radbourne : That's perfect. That's all from me, thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Cleo Zagrean with Macquarie. Please go proceed with your question. Cleo Zagrean : Good morning and thank you. With regards to pricing, ex-fuel, could you please comment on the outlook for core trends for coal and the rest of the business excluding coal, and how you expect mix to impact the operating ratio in 2015 versus 2014? Thank you. Don Seale : This is Don. Good morning. I will address the first part of the question first with respect to the pricing outlook, we expect it to be stronger based on transportation demand capacity issues in the marketplace. Truckload capacity is constrained as well as other modes, as we indicated earlier. So we expect the pricing outcome to be stronger in 2015 than we have seen in the past couple of years for sure. Can\u2019t get into the actual components of it, but we do not expect to see price increases in export coal. We will maintain our current pricing. As we have indicated in past quarters, we don\u2019t believe that we can move that market now with changes in our price. So, therefore, we will maintain our quarterly pricing we have in place.  With respect to our utility coal contracts, we have escalators that are in those contracts that will escalate. I will tell you that the all-inclusive less fuel index this year is projected to be up around 2% and then up 3% in 2016, which is a better outcome than we saw in \u201914. Cleo Zagrean : Would you say that transportation at the margin may help the competitiveness equation for domestic coal, and there may be some thinking or trade off that you would consider there to help volumes? Don Seale : I think if we see the economy continue to expand, which we believe it will with low energy prices, higher consumption based on savings to the consumer from those energy prices, that we will see increased activity in the economy both on the industrial sector, the manufacturing sector, as well as the consumer economy. So that should lead to improving electricity consumption and production and that certainly -- those two things certainly would help the utility franchise through the year. Cleo Zagrean : Thank you. And then the mix impact on operating income? Don Seale : Well, the mix impact, we will see more intermodal versus coal shipments. Our intermodal is growing the fastest of our entire network. Our merchandise is second and then coal, of course, has been contracting up to this point. All of that business is positive with respect to operating margin and operating income. I will tell you that intermodal puts a little bit more pressure on the operating ratio than, say, coal growth or strong merchandise growth. Cleo Zagrean : Thank you very much, and my follow-up relates to the operating ratio outlook. Can you help us understand your expectations for improvement this year for the main drivers, maybe price volume and productivity, and with any detail you would like to offer about operational initiatives that you are looking forward to this year, Bellevue and any others that you would like us to be aware of? Thank you. Wick Moorman : Well, I will take a stab at that. We clearly have a goal every year to continue to lower our operating ratio. We were successful at that, as you know, for 2014 and I guess that all I can say about various initiatives is that the operating ratio is -- has a numerator and a denominator and we have a lot of initiatives underway in both. We think that improving velocity will have very positive impacts on our cost structure. And as you heard Don say, we think this is a good pricing environment, and we think that the general strength of the economy gives us very good prospects for growth in a lot of the key elements of our business. So using both of those elements, it\u2019s our goal and intention to continue to lower the operating ratio in 2015 and in the future as well. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Rob Salmon, Deutsche Bank. Please go with your question. Rob Salmon : Thanks, Don. As you had answered one of Scott\u2019s questions earlier about kind of the intermodal side of the business, you had highlighted the fact that the time for intermodal margin expansion is now. And clearly there is a train length extension component of that, but if I switch over to the pricing side, could you give us a sense of how much of your domestic intermodal business is up for repricing in 2015 and whether that is a front-end loaded or a back-half loaded thing? Don Seale : Good morning. This is Don. I will tell you that on our domestic intermodal book about 60% of the business is being reprised in 2015. The largest tranche of that will be effective February 15. We have previously and that\u2019s a contract and I won\u2019t get into the increased level. I have previously indicated what our plans were for our public prices for EMP boxes, our domestic boxes, and that is running in the range of 5%. Rob Salmon : Thanks, Don. Then just a quick follow-up with regard to the cycle turns in intermodal. Can you give us a sense of how much the box turns have declined in 2014, whether you can speak to kind of where they are on the E&P or on the triple crown on a per month basis, or just overall percentage changes and how we should be thinking about that improving as velocity comes back? Don Seale : I don't have the percentage that I can give you offhand, but we will tell you that our -- as our train speeds declined in \u201914 our cycle times declined with that. We were running somewhere in the range of 27 miles per hour to 28 miles per hour in our intermodal network only, not our total network, but our intermodal network. And that declined in the range of 22 miles per hour to 23 miles per hour, beginning to come back up. So you can take that delta and certainly get to your answer with respect to cycle times. Operator : Thank you. There are no additional questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back to management for closing comments. Wick Moorman : Thanks very much for your patience. Thanks for all your questions again, all of our thanks to Don for his great service to our company. And we look forward to speaking with you all again at the end of the first quarter. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And thank you for your participation.",

Welcome to the Norfolk Southern First Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Katie Cook, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Ms. Cook. You may now begin Katie Cook : Thank you, and good morning. Before we begin today\u2019s call, I would like to mention a few items. First, the slides of the presenters are available on our website at norfolksouthern.com in the Investors section. Additionally, transcripts and downloads of today\u2019s call will be posted on our website. Please be advised that during this call we may make certain forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially from those projected. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. Additionally, keep in mind that all references to reported results, excluding certain adjustments that is, non-GAAP numbers, have been reconciled on our website in the Investors section. Now, it is my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Wick Moorman. Wick Moorman : Thank you, Katie and good morning everyone. It\u2019s my pleasure to welcome you to our first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. With me today are several members of our senior team, including our President, Jim Squires; our Chief Operating Officer, Mark Manion; and our Chief Financial Officer, Marta Stewart. As all of you know earlier this month we announced first quarter earnings of $1 per share, 15% lower than last year. These results reflected lower fuel surcharges on the top line as well as continued weakness in our coal franchise which restricted growth in revenue and revenue per units. Additionally, very severe weather in our service territories slowed our operations, increased our expenses and impacted our volumes.  With the exception of the ongoing effect of lower fuel surcharges and continued pressure in our coal markets, we believe that most of our issues will be largely resolved by the second half of the year. Having said that, we will be up against strong comps particularly in the second and third quarters as last year\u2019s results were wrecking record-setting quarters for us. Jim will share with you more detail on the revenue trends and the outlook for the remainder of the year.  With respect to service, we've already seen steady improvement in our network and we expect to reach our strong 2012-2013 velocity and service levels in the second half of this year. Mark will provide you with the latest on the relevant service metrics and our operations outlook and Marta will round it all out providing you with details of our full financial results.  Before getting down to the details, I\u2019ll just reiterate what I told all of you on our earlier call. We have a great team at Norfolk Southern and while there are always uncertainties around our markets, all of us are confident in the long-term strength of our franchise and our prospects for future success. On that note, I'll turn the program over to Jim, Mark and Marta and then I will return with some closing comments before taking your questions. Jim? Jim Squires : Thank you, Wick and good morning everyone. First quarter 2015 operating revenue declined 5% to $2.6 billion primarily due to a $102 million reduction in fuel surcharge revenues as a result of lower fuel prices. Growth in intermodal and merchandise volumes offset coal declines increasing first quarter volume 2% to 1.8 million units.  Revenue per unit declined 7% but without the impact of declining fuel surcharges revenue per unit declined only 2%. Mix shifts between increased volumes of intermodal and decreased volumes of coal offset strong pricing across most of our business segment. We will discuss the mix impact as we review each commodity group. Overall volume growth of 2% for the quarter was driven by a 5% gain in intermodal and a 3% gain in merchandise markets, partially offset by a 7% decline in coal volumes. After a strong start to the year, volume in the first quarter was again impacted by winter weather conditions and the accompanying service disruptions particularly throughout February. But similar to first quarter 2014 we achieved strong volume and improved service levels in March. Breaking out the market segments, starting with coal, first quarter volume decreased 7%. Coal burn at eastern utilities was down 14.5% in the first quarter due to lower national and regional natural gas prices, causing our utility volumes to decline 6%.  Volumes to northern utilities were down nearly 9% while volumes to southern utilities were down 2%. While handling a greater percentage of utility volume to our Southern utilities generally increases our coal revenue per unit, this positive mix impact was more than offset by a 20% decline in export coal volumes in the first quarter. Persistent weak conditions in the global marketplace, soft prices and a strong US dollar made it very difficult for US coals to complete in this oversupplied environment. Domestic metallurgical volumes were down 1% with weaker demand for met coals related to softer steel production and sourcing shifts partially offset by market share gains of coke ships [ph]. This decrease in volume and lower fuel surcharges reduced revenue by $86 million to $455 million, a 16% decline versus first quarter 2014. In addition to the previously discussed mix changes, lower fuel surcharges also negatively impacted margin.  Turning to our intermodal market. We continued to see strong volume growth of 5% to nearly 927,000 units. Intermodal pricing gains outpaced our other business units with continued growth expected the rest of the year. Despite these positive trends, decrease in fuel surcharge revenues drove the decrease in overall revenue and revenue per unit. The effects of lower fuel surcharge revenues more than offset a 2% increase in average revenue per unit already dampened by negative mix, resulting from higher volume increase in international freight. As we discussed before, international intermodal freight has a lower revenue per unit.  Merchandise revenue of $1.5 billion was down 32 million or 2% for the quarter with a 5% decline in revenue per unit. More than 80% of this RPU decline was due to fuel surcharges. We also experienced negative mix associated with increased volumes in lower rated sand, gravel and aggregates while higher rated iron and steel volumes decline. Our automotive sector was also impacted by negative mix with its decreased auto parts shipments and increased high level of traffic. Volume for the merchandise was up 3% overall with the strongest gain in our chemicals market due largely to increased shipments of crude oil from the Bakken and Canadian oilfields to East Coast refineries, as well as increased natural gas liquids from the Marcellus, Utica shale plays.  Automotive volumes increased 4% in the quarter with increased vehicle production at several key NS served plants. Our metals and construction markets benefited from increased volumes of aggregates for construction projects in the Southeast as well as increased frac sand volume into the Marcellus, Utica region to support natural gas drilling efforts. These increases were partially offset by reduced shipments of steel pipe and steel coil driven by a softening of the pipe market and reduced steel production in the quarter.  Agriculture shipments were up 2% with increased volumes of corn, moving to Southeast poultry producers as well as increased volumes of feed products and fertilizers. These gains offset reduced volumes of export soybeans resulting from a record South American crop, strength of the US dollar and limited railcar availability.  Finally paper and forest products volumes were flat in the quarter with strength in lumber related to the continuing housing recovery offset by reduced volumes of wood chips and waste materials. Let me close with expected trends in volume and revenue for the balance of the year. First, we expect solid volume growth in many parts of our franchise throughout the year. Highway conversions and corridor investments should continue to drive domestic intermodal growth while international intermodal shipments will benefit from the recovery following the West Coast port disruptions earlier in the year. We expect growth in natural gas liquids despite lower oil prices, crude by rail volumes. Double digit growth in housing starts and increases in construction activity should generate more lumber plastics, soda ash and aggregates traffic. Automotive volumes should grow at a rate better than North American vehicle production driven by output at key NS served plants.  Ethanol shipments should increase due to rising gasoline consumption and project related growth while a stronger crop should push export soybean volumes up later in the year. However lower oil prices are expected to cause declines in our metals and construction group as drilling activity slows reducing shipments of pipe, frac sand and other drilling imports. Further production curtailments by major steel producers and high inventories will likely dampen shipments of iron and steel products.  Lastly though natural gas prices, utility stockpiles at or above target levels, a strong US dollar and global oversupply will make this a challenging year for coal. We continue to obtain price increases at or above the rate of real inflation in most areas of our business and should see negative price mix effects abate in the second half. However high fuel surcharge recoveries in the comparable periods last year are likely to result in lower revenue in the second and third quarters and for the full year. By the final quarter of 2015, however, we expect top line growth to assume.  Thank you for your attention and I will now turn the presentation over to Mark who will provide an update on our first quarter operations. Mark Manion : Thank you, Jim. Restoring our service levels remains our primary focus. However safety is at the heart of everything we do. So let\u2019s take a look at our safety numbers.  Turning to Slide 2, our reportable injury ratio was 1.08 for the first quarter of 2015 as compared to 1.49 for the first quarter of 2014. The train incidents through March 2015 were 71 versus 61 over the same period last year. Grade crossing accidents through March were 76, down from 88 over the same period in 2014.  Now let\u2019s take a look at our service. While our service composite in the first quarter was lower than 2014 as a whole, we are operating at a higher level than we were in the fourth quarter even with the more challenging operating conditions that existed in the first quarter. In addition, as you can see on the right, our service has been trending upward since the end of February. The timeline and trajectory of our service recovery I provided on our last call which outlined the incremental improvement in the second quarter with more significant improvement in the second half of this year has not changed. We expect that composite service performance will be near 80% by the end of the second quarter. And as you see, the sizable improvement in train speed and dwell in December was maintained in January and although February was challenging recovery has been evident. We expect this trend of increasing train speed and terminal dwell reduction to continue through the rest of the second quarter. We fully anticipate that our end of quarter speed and dwell metrics will be commensurate with the superior service levels we achieved in 2012 and 2013.  As you have seen, we\u2019ve made solid improvements and we expect to see even larger gains in our service metrics by the end of the second quarter. Slide 5 outlines our plan that will lead to these larger gains. We have an increase of 600 conductors and 50 locomotive engineers between March 1 and July 1. We expect to take receipt of 40 additional SD90MACs during the same time period and we\u2019re already seeing the number of bad order locomotives normalize which will result in 160 additional locomotives available for service.  By the second half of the year we anticipate we will be storing some of our older higher maintenance locomotives which will reduce our expenses and strengthen our service reliability.  With regard to infrastructure, the connection track in Chicago as well as Goshen siding east of Elkhart were completed in April. Both of these projects will further improve our fluidity through the Chicago corridor. Lastly, the second phase of the Bellevue plant has begun with modification of the eastbound flows. The westbound flows will then be implemented later in the summer. The full implementation of Bellevue will improve velocity through reduced car handling, improved asset utilization and result in an overall reduction in cost structure.  In closing, we\u2019re confident our service will continue to trend in the right direction with sequential improvements in the second quarter. In the second half of the year we expect improved metrics consistent with strong service levels as the full effect of our investments is realized.  Thank you and now I will turn it over to Marta. Marta Stewart : Thank you, Mark. Now let\u2019s review our financial results for the first quarter. As you can see on Slide 2 and as has already been noted, the weather and service challenges significantly affected our first-quarter results. Jim discussed the 5% decline in revenues and while operating expenses decreased by $61 million or 3%. It was not sufficient to offset the revenue decline resulting in a 9% reduction in income from railway operation and an operating ratio of 76.4%. Slide 3 outlines the major cost categories affected by the weather and service recovery effort. These are estimated at $42 million the largest portion of which was in compensation and benefits. Additional service hours were incurred in all areas of operations, including train and engine employees for field service, mechanical employees to maintain the higher number of locomotives and maintenance way employees related to storm clean-up and repair. Similarly the other listed expenses reflect the increased cost of a slow network and added assets. Purchased services and rents were primarily affected by the decreased velocity, while the last two categories : materials and fuel were principally affected by the rise in locomotive count.  As we previously stated, some of the service recovery costs are expected to continue into the second quarter, however, at a lower level currently estimated at $25 million.  Turning now to Slide 4. This illustrates the year-over-year change by expense category. Fuel was the only category to decline versus the first quarter of last year and the decrease was largely attributable to lower prices as shown on the next slide.  Breaking down the components of the fuel expense change, $160 million of the reduction was due to price as consumption was flat on the 2% increase in traffic volume.  Slide 6 depicts a $43 million or 6% rise in compensation expenses. We had higher than usual wage rate and payroll tax increase. As discussed during our January call, the union wage increase was effective January 1 versus the July 1 timeframe of recent years. This resulted in a $26 million increase.  Payroll tax rates rose on January 1 as well and total payroll taxes were up $14 million. In addition, employee activity levels, increased hours, more overtime and more trainees added $14 million and signing bonuses related to our recently ratified agreement with the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers added $11 million. That labor agreement also calls for a lump sum bonus which will affect fourth quarter expenses by a similar amount.  The final significant item within the compensation area was the reduction in the accruals for incentive and stock comp, reflective of the quarter's results. Slide 7 shows purchased services and rent expense which increased by $31 million or 8%. This rise is primarily due to higher volume related activities such as equipment rents and intermodal operation. As previously mentioned, lower network velocity also caused these costs to rise. Turning to the next slide, materials and other expenses rose by $25 million or 11%, about half of the increase was due to higher materials expenses and was associated with both locomotive and maintenance of way usage. Environmental and personal injury expenses also rose in part due to a prior year favorable accrual. And lastly costs increased largely related to our train service employees who had more overnight stays as well as temporary transfers to areas on our systems with crew needs.  Depreciation expense displayed on Slide 9 rose by $8 million or 3%, reflecting our larger capital base as we continue to invest in infrastructure and equipment.  Operating expense headwinds are summarized on the next slide. In addition to the service recovery costs, the wage and payroll tax increases and the lump sum payment, 2015 expenses will include costs associated with the previously announced closing of our Roanoke, Virginia office. Approximately 450 employees will be affected by this move going from Roanoke to either corporate headquarters in Norfolk, operations headquarters in Atlanta or choosing to retire or resign. Moving and relocation costs in 2015 related to this transition are expected to total $35 million and will begin to be incurred in the second quarter although most of the costs will impact the third quarter when the bulk of the relocation are expected to occur. Efficiencies associated with this consolidation will begin to benefit expenses in the fourth quarter.  Next, income taxes totaled $185 million or an effective tax rate of 37.4% compared with 33.6% in 2014. As you may recall, last year contained a $20 million or $0.06 per share tax reduction resulting from a tax law change in Indiana.  Net income and EPS comparisons are illustrated on Slide 12. The $58 million net income decrease is a 16% decline compared to last year and diluted earnings per share of $1 was 15% lower than last year.  As shown on the final slide, cash from operations covered capital expenditures as well as our higher dividend level $181 million. On our fourth quarter earnings call in January, I mentioned we anticipated returning to a higher level of share repurchases. During the first quarter, we used cash on hand to buy back $415 million of our shares. We now expect full-year 2015 repurchases to be between 1.2 million and 1.3 billion. And with that, I thank you for your attention. And I will turn the program back to Wick. Wick Moorman : Thanks Marta. Well, as you've heard, clearly our first quarter results were not as strong as we and you expected that they would be. And in the short-term we face some continuing headwinds and the tough comps from last year. However we see continuing strength in the overall economy and as Jim described we have a lot of opportunities in many of the markets we serve and a great franchise with which to capitalize on these opportunities.  In addition, we\u2019re well on the way to restoring our network velocity and efficiency which will drive further costs out of our operation and as all of you know that will also enable us to secure more business at rates that drive positive returns for our shareholders. As we do that we also remain committed to returning cash to our shareholders as demonstrated through our strong dividend history as well as through our share repurchase program where as Marta just mentioned we\u2019re now targeting between 1.2 billion and $1.3 billion in share repurchases this year.  In sum, we have a proven strategy for success and the right people and resources to successfully execute it.  Thanks and I'll turn it back to the operator for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Thank you and our first question is coming from the line of Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley. Bill Greene : Jim, you obviously identified in your slides the challenges ahead from the fuel surcharge mechanism. We asked this last time as well but since we\u2019ve gone another quarter and now with the pre-announcement, is there any reason to think that you might sort of address that again and come back and say, maybe we need to adjust that and change that going forward a number of the freight transports at rebates to fuel surcharges given the volatility there. So what are your thoughts on fuel surcharges? Jim Squires : We are working toward shifting more of our revenue to an OHD based fuel surcharge mechanism over time and so that\u2019s going to take a while, it\u2019s contract by contract, customers have their own preferences. Our overall goal will be to increase rate and grow the revenue and -- but we recognize that our reliance on WTI in our fuel surcharge program creates volatility in our earnings and that\u2019s undesirable. So we will be working over time to shift to a more OHD based program. Bill Greene : Okay and then Jim, or even Wick, how you get confident in volume growth being actually a good thing? Obviously last year we had service challenges and we had unexpected growth and now we are having sort of a change in the macro outlook that's created some excess resources and yet the service levels aren\u2019t back. So can you sort of walk us through your thoughts on, does it make sense instead to sort of let\u2019s focus on getting the right kind of business on the network to result in a better margin or better outcome and not worry so much about the volume growth instead, do you know what I am getting at, right? So it seems like there needs to be more of a focus so much on shrinking the business, that will improve the service which is even better for price? Wick Moorman : Bill, I understand your question that I think it's a very reasonable and interesting one. One of the things that I will say about our volume growth is we don't go out and try to grow volume at rates and margins that don't make sense from the standpoint of shareholder value. So we're not -- we're certainly not in the mode of let's just grow volume for volume sake, and in fact, if you look at a lot of our volume growth this quarter it's been in intermodal where you know we made a lot of investments and where we're now seeing, as Jim mentioned, a very positive pricing trends. So we don't see that as a problem. In fact, we see volume growth at good rates as a strength for us. We also don't see that volume growth as severely impacting in any meaningful way our service recovery.  Our service recovery is based upon getting the right resources in there. We think we\u2019ve largely done that and we\u2019re on the right path back. Last year as you mentioned, we had some volume growth. We clearly did not foresee in the second and third quarter and got caught short primarily on the crew side. So the volume growth we're having right now we see as desirable, we see as continuing to be a good thing for us. As Jim mentioned in this quarter in particular and although we may see it for a little while longer, we saw some mix effects even within our merchandise business, this didn't overall -- didn't help our overall RPU but even within that, the somewhat lower rated traffic that was growing, was still good margin business and business that we want to continue to handle. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Unidentified Analyst : This is Ken on for Allison. So just a quick question on the buybacks, so I mean as you mentioned the buyback was pretty big in Q1 and you highlight a target of 1.2 million, 1.3 billion for the full year. Just curious on how that could possibly trend through the next few quarters, and whether there is any limit on how big of a buyback you can do in any one quarter? Marta Stewart : Well, the estimate of 1.2 billion to 1.3 billion is just a little bit higher than what we projected on the January call and so we are very comfortable with that level. We did not issue debt last year, we have plenty of debt capacity this year and we\u2019re comfortable with our projections, that that\u2019s going to be an amount of cash we\u2019re going to be able to return to the shareholders. Unidentified Analyst : And just as my follow-ups, so you mentioned that utility coal stockpiles were currently above target. Just curious how far above target you\u2019re seeing the stockpiles currently trend at your utilities and how long you would expect it to take to get back to that target level if we assume a normal weather environment? Mark Manion : Based on our estimates, utility stockpiles in the south at the end of March were at around 71.5 days, in the North 65.3 days. Rough target for southern stockpiles of 70 and for the northern utilities about 50 days. So as between the two of the northern utilities are a bit more overstock, the stockpile trends will depend heavily on the weather pattern in the summer and all of our assumptions around utility coal, in fact, you assume a normal weather pattern in the summer which would drive our volume assumptions going forward. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Tom Kim with Goldman Sachs. Thomas Kim : Marta, I wanted to ask about your Roanoke relocation. You talked about the incremental costs you\u2019re going to incur this year but I was wondering what are the savings we should anticipate next year? And then I guess more importantly, are there further opportunities to rationalize or consolidate your operations and is there a pipeline that you might have alluded to? Marta Stewart : Well, the Roanoke relocation had, Tom, two components to it. I mean the primary reason why we decided to do that was because we think it will be more effective for our people to be in fewer locations. So we think that will help the operations of all of the departments that are involved. So that was number one. But as a result of doing that, was sort of a catalyst to accelerate some G&A reductions that we have been planning for the next three or four years and so that allows us to \u2013 because some people are choosing not to move, that allows us just kind of accelerate those as I said. So we think we will have about 150 G&A positions between now and the end of the -- between the third quarter and the end of the first quarter of next year that will come out as a result of that. Thomas Kim : And then a question with regard to the coal and particularly I guess the coal exports. What are the levers you can adjust to a potentially longer and deeper down-cycle for export coals? I mean to what extent would it make sense to maybe even rationalize terminal interest and then maybe even with rolling stock, is there something you could do there, like you\u2019re satisfied with the utilization levels or could you do anything with regard to even that side of the business? Mark Manion : For starters, we can be very nimble with our equipment asset, serving our coal business, our export coal business. We can obviously redeploy the locomotives, we can downsize or curtail coal car replacements. So we have complete flexibility with regard to the equipment. The infrastructure adjustments would involve adjustments to maintenance levels particularly in the coalfield and in some cases perhaps longer-term mothballing of the asset but most likely the infrastructure side would involve service reductions until the volumes return. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rob Salmon with Deutsche Bank. Rob Salmon : With regard to the merchandise outlook, obviously there are couple of puts and takes with regard to your growth expectations, with weakness on the softening steel production side as well as growth in several other end markets. When I'm thinking about the crude by rail outlook, it sounds like you're expecting continued growth. I would imagine we should be seeing those that volume growth decelerate and potentially decline in the back half of the year but I was hoping for a little bit more color in terms of your expectations regarding that and commodity. Mark Manion : So we handled around 29,000 crude by rail shipments in the first quarter of 2015 and that compares to 22,000 crude by rail shipments in the comparable quarter last year. That\u2019s an increase of 34%. Now since the first quarter of last year we have had a handful of new customers come online. With softening oil prices we do expect the growth rate for crude by rail to decelerate but we think we should be able to maintain a ratable 29,000 or 30,000 car loadings per quarter this year. That would imply growth year-over-year in the second-quarter and for the full-year but we would be modestly negative relative to the crude by rail volumes in the third and fourth quarter. Rob Salmon : And then with regard to the train length opportunities on the merchandise network, do you feel like as the service improves that there should be the opportunity to extend out those train lengths in the back half of the year or given some of the softening of kind of the growth in crude by rail as well as likely declines in the steel production, will that be an offset in terms of your ability to gain some operating leverage opportunity in the merchandise network? Wick Moorman : We\u2019re always looking for ways to increase our average train lengths and in fact we are seeing an increase in our merchandise train lengths even now, I think we are in the neighborhood of 5900 feet thereabouts currently and keeping in mind that our system our siding capacity at a minimum is in the 8000 foot range. So lot of room to grow there and that\u2019s something we continue to work on and that has mostly to do with continuing to adjust our train plan, our operating network plan to be the most efficient. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Scott Group : Jim, I know you talked about expectations for revenue to remain down the next couple of quarters. I am wondering is if you can share with us your view, if you think that the revenue declines kind of moderate in the second and third quarter or do they kind of stay here, maybe even get worse and if you think based on that -- should we continue to expect kind of these double-digit type range declines and I know you don't typically give that level of color but obviously a lot of us have struggled modelling the numbers in the first quarter, so might be helpful just to get your perspective on your earnings and revenue? Jim Squires : Well, let me start by reminding you of the fuel surcharge comparisons in the second and third quarter. So in the first quarter of this year we booked $163 million in fuel surcharge revenue, that was a $132 million decline year-over-year. Last year in the second quarter we booked 358 million in fuel surcharge revenue, 369 million in the third quarter of last year. So assuming stable oil prices for the next couple of quarters that would imply roughly $200 million less fuel surcharge revenue per quarter for the second and third quarter. Then in the fourth quarter the comparisons get a little bit easier. Last year we took in $308 million in fuel surcharge revenue in the fourth quarter. So that right there is a pretty significant revenue headwind for the next couple of quarters.  On the other hand, as I said we expect some of the negative mix effects we saw in the first quarter to begin to abate. And so by the third quarter \u2013 based on our current forecast we would be looking for revenue for shipment excluding FSCs to turn favorable. And similarly revenue ex fuel surcharges in the third quarter will turn favorable and then by the fourth quarter we start to see overall growth in the top line. Now that obviously has a volume component as well and there we are feeling pretty bullish. Obviously the declines in coal volume are not helping but we\u2019re feeling as if on the utility side, natural gas substitution has run its course and we should be able to see a fairly stable utility coal volume run rate for the balance of the year albeit with the tough comparisons to last year. So that\u2019s our overall outlook on the revenue and so we have a lot of opportunities to grow revenue and as I said the negative mix effect should begin rolling off in the second half. Scott Group : And then just other question as we think bigger picture and a lot of rails have operating ratio targets in that 60%, low 60% range and I'm wondering as you think about the business, Jim, are there -- do you think that there are structural differences for you or Eastern rails in general or is that eventually a place where you think you can get to with the right mix of revenue and costs? Jim Squires : No, last year at this time we were on the verge of producing some of the best quarters that we\u2019d produced in this company\u2019s history and the lowest operating ratios as well. And that was possible because we were seeing significant growth, volume growth in our merchandise and intermodal businesses in particular and that was sufficient to more than offset declines in our coal business and that's the formula for us going forward. We will begin to see our coal volume stabilized at some point and we will, we believe, grow our merchandise volumes, our highest incremental margin volumes and our intermodal volumes with a substantial price increases to grow. That is a formula for continued improvement in our financial performance and for materially lower operating ratios in the future. Wick Moorman : Yes, let me add to that. I think that sure inherently if you -- relative to franchise businesses, the west looks different than the east, looks so different in Canada but we, as Jim mentioned, we came off of -- we come off a year where we took our operating ratio for the year below 70 for the first time. We expect to continue to drive operating ratio improvement and we have a very very strong franchise particularly in terms of intermodal and merchandise. So I think that the pace of when you get there is obviously always something that the economy will largely determine as well as our own efforts but we have internal goals for driving operating ratio down and we believe that we will continue to do that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Tom Wadewitz : Wanted to ask you a little bit about the pricing. You got a lot of moving parts in the revenue side and you\u2019ve highlighted the mix headwinds. But is there any way to kind of disentangle that and talk about core price, give us a sense of \u2013 were you at in the first-quarter or if you don\u2019t want to do that, if you just talk about progression, should we expect ex-mix to see acceleration in year-over-year price or did you kind of already get the step-up from tighter rail capacity in the first quarter and the negative mix rolling off, or how do we think about -- how much core price you\u2019re getting and whether that accelerates if you look in the second quarter, third quarter? Jim Squires : We were successful in meeting our goal of increasing pricing, core pricing at a rate at or better than rail cost inflation measured based on all inclusive less fuel in the first quarter, in most of our businesses. Generally speaking outside coal, we were able to drive pricing higher and I think most encouragingly we saw the largest core pricing increase across our book of business in our intermodal line. Tom Wadewitz : What do you see \u2013 you referred to a lift, where did you a lift in the first quarter? Jim Squires : So reported a lift [ph] in the first quarter 2.8%. Tom Wadewitz : So it\u2019s not really caveat lifting across the board, you would have done better than that 2.8% if we looked at the core price kind of taking out next, is that fair? Jim Squires : Right, right, with the exception of coal as I mentioned, virtually across the board, there were pockets where we were stronger. But on average we were able to meet the goal of increasing core prices at that rate. Tom Wadewitz : And what about the aspect of accelerating? I mean it seems like you are pretty optimistic about improving the network performance, so you would think that customer service would improve as you look into through second quarter and second half, I guess the truck market seems like it boosts into a bit maybe freight overall isn\u2019t as strong. But do you think there is more momentum in pricing, that would accelerate or have you kind of achieved the run rate in the first quarter and if you stay stable in the next couple of quarters. Jim Squires : We will stay focused on raising prices at a rate better than, at or better than rail inflation. That\u2019s our long-term goal. The contracts vary by quarter, the pricing opportunity varies quarter by quarter but overall we\u2019re going to stay very very focused on that goal and are confident we can achieve it. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Matt Troy with Nomura Securities. Matt Troy : I just had a question, maybe a big picture overview of the network. You guys have done a good job of explaining your target of returning the service metrics, speed or dwell or your composite service indices back to kind of the peak 2012 2013 levels by 2Q. And you\u2019ve also kind of outlined very nicely what you intend to do to get there. I just wanted to take a step back and maybe understand from an operational perspective, if we were to look at a network map, sort of a heat map if you will, what are the key areas that you need to address, the pinch points if you will, as you\u2019ve given us the pieces to get us there, the targets that you like to reach, I just would like a better understanding because we\u2019re only 6 to 8 weeks out from kind of the middle of the second quarter, or the start of the third quarter when you can hit these goals. What are the focal points that will help you get to \u2013 to get to these targets? Jim Squires : Well our most challenging part of the system last year and into the first quarter was our Chicago line and really principally between Chicago and the Cleveland area and a lot has gone on in order to increase our velocity and I will say that, that area is running really well now. There\u2019s just really been a lot of focus on it. So in order to do that there was a \u2013 we really pinpointed the manpower increases which has come along very nicely and I will just say that we\u2019re in pretty darn good shape up in that area from a manpower standpoint. Now another thing that has been going on for a longer period of time is infrastructure improvement up there and I did mention the fact that we got a couple of significant infrastructure projects that are now complete, that just give us -- it just gives us a bigger pipe around that traffic through there. So keeping in mind that parts of that area, they will run a 100 or more trains a day. So infrastructure improvement, nice increases the Bellevue project like I said, it\u2019s more to come which will be very helpful as well as we go through the summer. So that\u2019s the area we put a lot of concentration into and it\u2019s paid off very nicely and of course a lot of the things going around the other parts of the system and other very important parts of the system but that was the big focus and it\u2019s really had a nice ending. Matt Troy : And my follow up would be on the intermodal piece. The international volume growth of 8%, makes sense given the potential for some diversions, residually from the West Coast port strike, work stoppage but the domestic piece, the volume is up only 3%, was a little bit lighter than I think we become accustomed to seeing through given your good traction and progress in highway conversions. Wondering if you could just update us on the corridor gateway strategy and was that 3% representative kind of more of a GDP level growth what you'd expect this year or were there certain mix factors or contractual factors that we saw a little bit of a dip in the growth in domestic intermodal for you folk should kind of resume at a multiple of GDP as it has been in the past? Jim Squires : Sure Matt. Let me take a stab at that. So within the domestic intermodal we obviously have several channels. The intermodal company IMC channel principally hub and hunch grew at 6%. So that's a little closer to our historical growth rate and that\u2019s a sort of growth rate we would expect to see or better out of that channel going forward. Our premium and triple crown books declined somewhat and that's what led to the overall 3% increase in volume and the total domestic book. Going forward we do think that that we can continue to drive the entire domestic intermodal franchise at growth rates more like mid high single digits. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Our next question comes from the line of John Barnes with RBC. John Barnes : First on the operating ratio improvement, so asking for a specific target but whatever we model for OR improvement you\u2019ve given \u2013 you got the service related costs, you got the savings from Roanoke, you got some things like that, can you just talk about the magnitude of each of those and kind of from most important to least important, what's going to drive the improvement going forward? Marta Stewart : The main thing that will drive improvement will be getting the network back to the velocity that Mark mentioned. So the train speed, the terminal dwell, improvements that he mentioned, he thinks will have in the second half of the year, that is the main thing that will help us with expenses. I would like to point out if you are looking at the OR that going forward as Jim mentioned the fuel surcharge component of it is going to be quite a drag on our operating margins the rest of the year. John Barnes : And then from network velocity, kind of what\u2019s the next couple of catalysts there? Marta Stewart : After network velocity? So it\u2019s just general productivity \u2013 and again that network velocity we think will begin to \u2013 will happen towards the end of the second quarter. So we expect that improvement to happen in the second half of the year. Wick Moorman : If you look at our track record for the 2012-2013 period and we discussed this a lot. When you ramp the network up you start to take -- not only do you take the costs out that Marta has been discussing but it then sets the stage for even further projects to continue to drive costs down particularly as volume grows and it's that combination of an ever higher network velocity Mark mentioned Bellevue and we talked to you about the savings that are coming online as we turn Bellevue on. But it\u2019s a combination of having a stable high velocity network which then sets the stage for continuing projects to drive velocity along with the leverage as Jim mentioned the volume growth that really drive the economics of Norfolk Southern and for that matter any railroad. John Barnes : And then my follow up is \u2013 Jim, you talked about stability on the coal franchise. Can you talk about how \u2013 how you weigh getting to maybe a more stable but lower level of coal both on the domestic and the export side and when you sort of make maybe some of those service adjustments and begin to take assets out, begin to downsize or rationalize the size of your coal support network, I mean when do you begin to do that, what do you have to see from a stability standpoint to really start to hammer again with the costs on the coal side if stable is going to be what we get going forward? Jim Squires : Let me start with the utility side of the franchise and give you some of our assumptions for the balance of the year, and I will be referring to utility tonnage here. We did 21.1 million tons of utility coal in the first quarter and our current forecast has that level of utility volume holding basically steady for the remainder of the year. As I mentioned, we do believe that gas substitution with met gas in the current price range has run its course, there's very little tonnage left to come out due to match and of course the implications of carbon regulation down the road are somewhat unknown at this point. But in terms of mets we will maybe see 500,000 fewer tons this year and so at that level of volume that\u2019s albeit significantly depressed from last year and even more so from years past. We probably do not have an opportunity and would not want to take out significant infrastructure. On the other hand we can and already have downsized our equipment investments in our coal business. At this level of volume we can make do with our current coal car fleet for some time, that have been relieved of the significant capital investments in coal price. That pertains really more to the export side of the business. So let me touch on that as well. We handled 5.3 million tons of export coal in the first quarter, that\u2019s down significantly from last year first quarter which was our peak quarter for export coal. For the remainder of the year we are calling for 4.5 million to 5 million tons of export. Feel pretty confident on the thermal side of that. If there's a downside potentially it would be more on the met side or central app producers are very challenged right now. But again at kind of a $20 million annual run rate, 20 million ton annual rate for export coal, we probably would not want to significantly downsize our infrastructure, although we do have the opportunity to reduce spending on equipment and people side of it is something we can modulate as well. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Unidentified Analyst : This is Prashant [ph] in for Chris. I apologize, earlier we were having a little headset issue here. I realized running a little bit late in the call. So I could be brief \u2013 we\u2019re curious to know the growth potential for the core business and taking apart, leaving aside fuel surcharge and coal, if you got the core normalization do you think we could see the core grow in double-digit and in 2015 are really corn services the biggest factors preventing that, is there any way to isolate either, is that the right way to sort of think about that? Jim Squires : Well, if by core business, you mean our merchandise, our industrial product businesses. So we do see growth potential there in 2015 and beyond, definitely. Now there are always puts and takes. We have some challenges on our metals and construction franchise right now due to very low steel prices and reduced demand for pipe in particular. Wall Street Journal quoted $444 per ton as the going price for hot rolled coil this morning, that\u2019s down from $474 at the end of March. So steel prices are very depressed and the capacity utilization is tracking below 70%. So we have some challenges on that side of our MetCon franchise. On the other hand, our steel within MetCon, aggregates were up significantly. Construction car loadings were up, cement traffic was up, driven by housing and road construction. So there are definite bright spots. On the energy side of the core franchise as well we see continued opportunity. Over in chemicals we were able to grow NGLs, crude by rail, we\u2019ve already discussed. Our plastics businesses were up, those are all indications of a pretty healthy industrial economy and should be the drivers of significant growth in our industrial products franchise going forward. Our ag volumes were up in the first quarter as well and that we see continued promise there for the balance of the year as well. So overall we feel real good about our industrial products franchise albeit there are always a few soft spots. And the intermodal continues to grow and on top of the volume growth this year we expect to see significant price increases. I mentioned that our core prices were up in our intermodal business more than in any other business segment in the first quarter and that\u2019s very very encouraging. Unidentified Analyst : And just as a quick follow up, on the comp and employee issue, it looks like on a per average employee basis the year over year change is just under about 2% which, kind of thinking about that and going forward on a year over year basis, how to think about that line item? Are there offsets to the headwinds and what are some of the initiatives that you guys see on the table, maybe in terms of combating some of the headwinds you pointed out on slides? Wick Moorman : Well, if you look at our comp right now, obviously and we discussed this before, we have the labor agreements which cover about 85% of our workforce. We had the effectively an early pay increase as a result of the last round of negotiations that kicked in, in January rather than July 1, as Marta has discussed. As we look at overall headcount clearly we\u2019re focused right now on getting the right number of people in our train and engine service workforce to handle the traffic without delay. I will say that as these numbers and Mark showed you the conductors and engineers we expect to bring on in the next couple of months most of them are included in the headcount today because they are trainees at the end of the first quarter. As they come on they come off training status in which they are effectively paid a salary ad start to be paid on the trip rate. So that that will then be proportional to our operations and then on the non-agreement side and in a particular G&A side as Marta mentioned we\u2019re always looking at ways to do everything we need to do with the lower headcount and the Roanoke closure will help precipitate some of that. We will continue to look at that and try and drive those costs down wherever we can. Jim Squires : Let me just add a footnote to Roanoke office closure question, having spent a lot of time with our marketing team in the last couple of months I'm really really excited about having all of our sales and marketing team under one roof here and that is going to allow us to produce a much focus and consistent approach to growing our top line and will have an opportunity to move people around between jobs that might not have been able to move around between in the past and there will be similar surgeries from a workforce standpoint across all of the functions that are currently in Roanoke today or IT and accounting departments. Marta Stewart : On the operation side, what I would add is Wick is exactly right, the increases that Mark described we have \u2013 you see those reflected in the average headcount which was up sequentially from the fourth quarter by 500 and what we\u2019re projecting for the remainder of the year is another 500 increase, most of that will occur by the end of the third quarter and that is almost exclusively in the operating area. So by the end of the year we think we will be up 1000. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JP Morgan. Brian Ossenbeck : So just two quick ones. Jim, you mentioned a lot of the headwinds of the strong dollar and some of the disruptive imports that we\u2019re seeing in the steel. You also mentioned you expect ethanol and soybeans to be up. So maybe if you could just summarize why you think those are moving and overall do you think that a strong dollar has a positive factor or a negative excluding coal and for the rest of the business, is strong dollar a positive or negative? Jim Squires : Well, most of our business is US domestic economy focused. So there are certainly pockets of resistance in the revenue based on the stronger dollar. We highlighted a few of the most prominent of which would export coal and pockets elsewhere as well. But I don't see an overall dampening effect on the total revenue necessarily outside export coal from the much stronger dollar. In certain pockets of our business it will be an additional challenge but we have enough drivers of revenue growth within the US domestic economy to push the top line higher based on our portfolio even with the strong dollar. Brian Ossenbeck : And just one follow up on export coal side. You mentioned you\u2019re pretty confident on the thermal side and how that looks for the rest of the year but I know the mix has kind of bounced around a little bit. Could you just give us a refresher on what mix was in the first quarter and perhaps what you expect for the rest of the year? Jim Squires : In the first quarter of this year 64% of the export tons we handled was metallurgical and 36% was thermal and that compares to last year\u2019s 69% met, 31% thermal. So we had a relatively high proportion of thermal coal in the first quarter this year. We think that will revert in the balance of the year to more of the 75 :25 type of split. Now going back we were almost all metallurgical coal, the last couple of years kind of 70%, 80% met and the rest thermal has been kind of the common split and we think we will get back to something like that split. I will say though that the demand is still firm around the thermal side of the franchise right now and north app producers were able to jump on some opportunities there in the first quarter and that\u2019s why we saw the thermal part spike somewhat relative to the metallurgical coal moving predominantly over Lambert\u2019s Point. And by the way as you probably know most of the metallurgical coal we handle moves over Lambert\u2019s Point and most of the thermal coal moves over Baltimore.  If there is a potential downside in our assumptions roughly 4.5 billion to 5 million tons per quarter for export coal, it would be on the metallurgical coal which in our case is coming out of central app and because of all of the factors we mentioned, stronger dollar, the global over-supply of coal, Queensland and 109 and spike coals moving prices below that, because of very low bulk dry shipping rates, it\u2019s just an extremely difficult environment for central app producers in particular right now. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Justin Long : I wanted to ask a question about PTC. As you\u2019ve continued to roll out this technology how much of a disruption is it causing to the network? Is this a contributor to congestion in the rail network today or would you say it's not a significant needle mover when you think about fluidity? Wick Moorman : It\u2019s something we\u2019re paying a whole lot of attention to and it has everything to do with how well we plan it. Those PTC cutovers take place on a regular basis each month and the good thing is that our signaling communication group are doing a very good job of reducing the amount of disruption that takes place with each of the events and case in point when we started this out and we\u2019ve been doing it for a while now but when we started these out the outages were in the neighborhood of 12 hours and of course we do a lot of scheduling and planning around that to really minimize the disruptions but as we've gone along here outages have gone to eight hours and now in more cases down to six hours. We\u2019ve got some things going on where we think we can reduce them even below six, some of them to little as four hours. So a lot of planning and schedule workarounds so the disruption factor will be minimized going forward but still something we do a lot of planning around. Jim Squires : No, I will add one thing to that which I think it's very good question which \u2013 and we have not talked about that in any detail nor of the other railroads but I will say that we got a lot of the really problematic areas on the railroad in terms of traffic disruption down last year. We still have some more to go and my analogy for it last year was we were almost \u2013 it was almost like we were constantly running a low-grade fever. We had a lot of work to do out there and a lot of significant disruption that as Mark said we planned around it, we did everything we could but nonetheless it was disruptive and it's something that as Mark has described we continue to work on and in fact it's a real point of focus for us right now as we look at restoring our network velocity. Justin Long : That\u2019s helpful color and I will just sneak one more in on intermodal. I was curious are you getting a lot of pushbacks from your customers and your IMCs on the Intermodal price increases you are going out with today? And also as of today how much of your book of business in Intermodal had been repriced at higher levels call it at mid-single-digit range over the past year? Jim Squires : We are not getting a lot of pushback on price increases. We are aligned with our intermodal partners in view of the marketplace and in desire to take prices higher at this point. If you look at our equipment by line of business as an indicator of where we have the opportunity to lean into price most, E&P is about 70% of the total book by volume and that\u2019s where as the rail owned fleet, rail equipment fleet is that's where we have the most ability to take prices up on spot basis. So also on the triple crown side of things at 10% of our total book by volume we can lean into rate for us as well. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Brandon Oglenski : Jim, welcome to the hot seat. And as you guys know we have been supportive of the stock here, so I am going to be conservative with these questions. But I do think it\u2019s worth of your shoulders to ask some of the difficult questions here though too. And granted I have never on train, we just live in Axle model, so please tell us we are wrong. But this quarter volume was up 2%, 3% growth in merchandise and intermodal is up 5% and yet earnings are down 15% on what was a pretty easy comp from last year given all the weather disruptions. So I mean that\u2019s a lot of the frustration I think with your shareholders and if I listened to the strategy to drive improvement going forward it\u2019s getting price above inflation which we got this quarter, it\u2019s getting growth in those intermodal merchandise segments and it\u2019s stability in the coal book. But I guess my concern here is where is the profitability outside of coal? I think you've even said and Wick said it in the past no, coal is a very profitable segment for you but where are the margins and returns on intermodal merchandise and is that going to be enough to drive future earnings growth for this company or do we have all these continual cost pressures and fuel surcharge headwinds or are we just not going to be able to see a lot of earnings expansion even with those pretty robust growth rates outside of coal? Jim Squires : But let me add we appreciate the candor and by all means essence of questions. And we demonstrated last year that we can drop the operating ratios significantly based on solid general merchandise volume growth and intermodal volume growth even with coal headwinds. Now when you are talking about coal volumes down 7% overall in the quarter that's a pretty strong headwind and that is more difficult and we lost ground this quarter, no doubt about it. But that will stabilize. We will see a bottom on coal volumes and as we discussed on this call we think we may be there already. And then we have the opportunity to see continued growth in many areas of our merchandise franchise and in our intermodal franchise. Put on top of that significant price increases and you do have a recipe for growing earnings. It's essential that we get the network back up to speed, we have a plan to do that, we have the resources coming online. There will be some cost headwinds as we get from here to there in the short-term but once the network is back up to 2012, 2013 service levels we will see significant cost drop out as well. So it\u2019s the combination of that basic efficiency and the cost reductions, it comes from running a faster network, bottoming out of coal volumes and combination of volume growth and price in our general merchandise and intermodal businesses. Brandon Oglenski : I mean you are not doing a railroad to see some pretty challenging coal numbers and I do agree with Wick\u2019s assessment that there is differences between the East and Western Canada but there are some similarities between Western Canada at least in terms of achieving a mid to low 60s OR for a lot of these carriers with public targets to get there, and if I am hearing you correctly, Jim, it sounds like we need to have stability in coal before we can get any real traction on the operating ratio. But I think there will be a lot of skeptics on the buy-side at least or your investor base where if we look at natural gas being up 5$ in the future, there is still some incremental gas capacity in the east and on top of it the export market doesn\u2019t look all that solid as you\u2019ve confirmed on this call. So can Norfolk get traction on margins even if coal continues to be maybe a modest headwind heading forward? Jim Squires : I really do. This is going to be a tough year. We will start to see the top line grow again in the fourth quarter we think based on our current forecast. Until we get the top line moving it will be difficult for us to make a lot of improvement. That\u2019s coming. These mix effects that you saw in the first quarter are somewhat transitory. Over lings will bottom out, now we cannot say with total assurance that we have hit bottom in terms of coal volume today but we started our utility franchise pretty carefully and gas substitution becomes more difficult at this point with gas plants running full out. Now the export side of things there are headwinds there but there are opportunities as well particularly on the thermal side of that franchise. So we think we can do it, we\u2019ve got a couple of tough quarters ahead of us with the fuel surcharge headwind with some additional costs out there to get service back up. But once we are there on the service, once we see coal volume stabilized and we get past this fuel surcharge headwind we are in great shape to continue with the performance. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Ken Hoexter : I am going to take a little bit of a different take on some of the same questions there but it looks like service starting to show some improvement still at the mid-70s operating ratio for the quarter. Why such a contrast? Maybe I could address this to Mark between your need to add the 650 employees between the conductors and engineers, the 200 some on locomotives and when you look at Canadian Pacific's plan to cut resources which creates a lot of capacity. Maybe Mark, can you just describe maybe a little bit of the differences in the operations or how you\u2019re running it so we can understand why we can see such a great contrast between one creating capacity and the ability to move more versus what \u2013 how you\u2019re structuring the operations? Mark Manion : Well as far as the resources we\u2019re adding we know that when we\u2019re in the process of ramping up it's almost like you can\u2019t have enough locomotive, you need a certain number of locomotives just to spin yourself up, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re in the process of doing and in fact, I've got my sights set on restoring locomotives before long, in fact, we will probably get into that by May and give ourselves a surge fleet, we will see how far we go one to 200 locomotives. And same thing on the people side, I mean you need a certain number of people that man your trains and it is activity based, we pay them when they work. So we need to take on more people, we will stabilize on the people side by the end of the second quarter and from there on we essentially outside of business growth opportunities as we get into the second half, we\u2019re going to be levelled off on people and we will be hiring for attrition. So we don't see ourselves doing anything particularly differently than with the other railroads do as far as that goes. Ken Hoexter : So I guess maybe just to key taking into there \u2013 to take a step further, is it the network resets you\u2019ve done a few times over the long weekends or is it changing the operating plan which creates that extra capacity? Mark Manion : No, we said last year that depending on the severity of the winter that we would do as we typically do as we come out of these winter events. These are big network systems and they ramp up on a gradual basis, that is what has been happening ever since March. And so we\u2019re seeing some nice nice ramp-up now and I'm sure you look at our numbers as well you see our cars online going down, you see our bad order ratio going down, our train performance is improving, our connection performance improves, the number of locomotives available improves, all that drives overall network velocity but it happens in a gradual way. And we will see that, we will continue day in and day out see that gradual improvement take place through May, through June and I think by the end of June we will see some pretty darn good numbers. Wick Moorman : Just in overall theme let me say one more thing about that. And it goes back to this idea every franchise is different, every railroad is different and the Eastern carriers obviously are as all of you know shorter haul complex networks and that\u2019s fine. For one thing we live where all the people are and we think that has a lot of positives in terms of growing. But the overall belief that I think everyone in the railroad industry shares is that velocity creates capacity and that's where we are going. The first thing you do is get your velocity where you want it to be, where we\u2019ve had ours in the past. As you see velocity go up, as Mark mentioned, cars online goes down, our terminals get more and more fluid and that\u2019s what then drives further operating and cost improvement and that's the path we\u2019re on. And if you look at some of the things we've done in the past here we've done a lot of work on our terminals in terms of we closed two significant yards. We've expanded one to make up for that and to make up for changes in our traffic base. So the patterns may look somewhat different based on the franchise but the theme is always the same in terms of constantly improving the velocity of your railroad no matter whose railroaded it is in order to create cost efficiencies and create further capacity. Ken Hoexter : And if I could get to follow-up, I guess Jim as you prepare to take over in two months or so what are your thoughts on M&A? Obviously we\u2019ve heard Wick\u2019s kind of thesis in the past. I am just wondering how you view the world and obviously given the discussions that we've heard from some of the Canadians and maybe your peer on the east in the past, just want to get your insight and whether you think it's possible -- if not, why not and then if not now, does that mean something could happen in the future, maybe just some thoughts on that? Jim Squires : Sure. Well I will share a few thoughts and then I will invite Wick to chime in as well. First of all, let me start by saying that we are a public company, we\u2019re obviously here for our shareholders. So there are no categorical answers in that regard. On the other hand we do see significant challenges associated with further consolidation. The regulatory review process for consolidations in this industry is very very time-consuming, onerous and risky and I say that as one who practically lives at the surface transportation board for year and a half or so as we were going through Conrail. It's a very unpredictable process, and it is a very costly and risky process as well. And there are relatively few synergies to be achieved in exchange for those risks as well, the remaining combinations in this industry are end to end and by definition fewer synergies available. So we don't it's a good idea and we think we have a freight business plan around this company on a standalone basis, that what we can do with this company is better than anything that could be achieved. Wick Moorman : Jim and I agree completely about this but I think Jim's first caveat obviously is important here. We are a publicly traded company. We are interested in long-term welfare and benefits to our shareholders. That is our job and we understand it very clearly. But I think that what is sometimes really underestimated by those who don\u2019t live or immersed themselves in the regulatory environment in the way that we do is just how hard it would be a) to have any kind of transaction approved particularly under the new merger rules where a) by definition it has to be pro- competitive whatever that -- and no one has defined that.  And second, the enormous risks that the conditions imposed if you were even able to get a merger approved by the STB would negate any and all benefits and beyond of the transaction itself. And there would be an enormous amount of resistance on the certain parts of our customer base and we just think that you never say never and the time may well come, but right now it\u2019s not a time where trying to do a transaction of any size makes any sense. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Buckingham Research. Jeff Kauffman : I want to ask a question on a different aspect of the coal franchise. Given that most US based coals are well out of the money globally and given that the utility inventories remain quite high, I think up till now everybody is focused mainly on the volume aspect of the coal franchise. But I guess the question becomes at what point do either the coal producers or utility customers say if we want to keep the coal moving we need a pound of flesh and let\u2019s revisit the pricing so that we can keep coal competitive and keep coal moving? When we look at your contracts both for export and domestic, can you give us an idea of when they get repriced, come up for renewal and how much confidence do you have in this kind of environment that we won't have this new leg down this fall when these contracts or next year we go to reprice? Jim Squires : We believe we continue to have a compelling value proposition and our ability to deliver coal from various basins and various ways to our utility and export customers and we\u2019re going to reprice that on a value basis. So on the export side there just isn't that much we could do unfortunately. Our major customers are finding it very difficult to place coals into the global market particularly on the metallurgical side. So our goal as is the case across our franchise is to obtain the maximum value for the dollar for the value that we provide our customers and we will continue to do that in the coal business sense as I flip throughout our financials. Jeff Kauffman : And domestic? Jim Squires : Same story. A I said we think natural gas substitution which has been the driving factor in the decline in utility volumes, has largely run its course and we are in position to continue holds to our utility customers. A normal summer weather is critical to our assumptions in that regard though. Another very cool summer and we could see further declines but provided we have a normal summer we think we are in good shape to manage a pretty consistent run rate on the utility coal this year. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl of Cowen and Company. Jason Seidl : Two quick ones. One, can you talk a little bit about your ability to price as your service levels start coming up, because clearly you are getting price now and services as well, let\u2019s call it less than optimal. Is there any relation between rail service and pricing or should we not look at that way? Jim Squires : Clearly there is and our pricing potential will only improve with better service levels in the long run. You have to give the customer something more in order to obtain price increases and that\u2019s one of the big reasons we're spending now to get service back up so that we will be able to grow volumes but also so that in the long run we will be able to take prices up for a better and better product delivered to the customer. Jason Seidl : And I guess my follow up but I apologize if you guys already covered this because there were some overlapping calls this morning. We haven't seen any announcements out there in terms of getting Don's positions, so I was wondering where you guys are out there and are you reviewing outside candidates? Jim Squires : We are reviewing both internal and outside candidates. We have been running a process, we expect to complete that process and make an announcement within a matter of a few weeks. Operator : The next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. David Vernon : Hey Marta, first question for you, how much additional borrowing capacity do you have and have you gotten more comfortable raising the overall borrowing and leverage profile of the business going forward? Marta Stewart : Yes, we have quite a bit of additional borrowing capacity as I mentioned earlier and as I am sure you know, we didn\u2019t issue any debt last year. So we are planning to issue debt this year and we're comfortable bringing up our leverage levels but staying within our current credit ratings BBB plus, Baa1. David Vernon : Is there like a target level of coverage that you are shooting for? Marta Stewart : Well the target is stay within the credit ratings band, because last year we did issue we floated down a little bit within the band. We are still within the band of floated down a bit. So we're comfortable ramping up towards the upper end of that band but staying within it. David Vernon : And then maybe just as a quick follow up, Jim or Mark, I guess have you guys given any thought into how much of the service related costs you guys are pouring into the network right now actually do come down and I mean I get the velocity driven improvement, you pulled some costs down but I would also think that the change in the freight flows across your network are requiring a different level of resources than you had in the past, and changing like haul, the longer haul intermodal, less short haul coal, that kind of stuff? I mean how much of the extra investments you are putting in, should we expect to actually come out? Marta Stewart : We are expecting the 42 million that we highlighted in the first quarter. We think it\u2019s going to moderate to 25 million and roughly the same categories that I outlined, a little bit less percentage wise and compensation because the compensation part in the first quarter had a transportation part and maintenance of way part related to the weather. So percentage wise the comp part will come down a little bit and the total will be 25 million and then we believe if we get up to the train speed levels that Mark described in the second half we think we will not have services, so that 25 million in other words would go away in the third and fourth quarters. David Vernon : But do you get like the 42 million or the 25 million back next year or do you think there\u2019s going to be some of that costs, it\u2019s just going to be in the network? Mark Manion : No, I think those costs are the costs that we view as purely transitory in nature and the answer to your other question is that yes, as we see business mix change we can see some shifting in resource requirements particularly in terms of maybe where we need train crews but net, net I don't think that those changes are material in terms of overall crew requirements or train operating costs. David Vernon : Even that, with the difference in length of haul and coal, do you think that would just take more labor hour but \u2013 Wick Moorman : Well you are looking at length of haul on coal changing as basins change, the Illinois basin coal comes on, we hold the coal longer farther as the mix changes within coal. In intermodal we\u2019ve done a pretty good job and expect to continue to of really not necessarily running a lot more trains but just getting more and more containers on each one of the trains through stacking and additional train length. As I say, Mark, I don't think net net that amounts to a whole lot. Operator : The next question is from the line of Cleo Zagrean with Macquarie. Cleo Zagrean : My first question relates to coal, so I appreciate that we may be looking at a stabilization in quarterly run rate on the domestic and maybe I guess export front to grow but still this year we are looking to \u2013 it sounds like 10% decline in the domestic volume and maybe mid-teens in exports. So let this [ph] coal alone do to your operating margin or to the operating ratio this year in terms of the headwind? Jim Squires : It unquestionably is a headwind, when we see the kind of year over year declines that we experienced in the first quarter of 2015 and projecting for the balance of the year. So yes, we think it\u2019s steadier run rate both utility and export coal tonnage but the comparisons are difficult. Second-quarter of 2014 was our peak quarter for utility coal volume and so we are comping that very difficult comparison and similarly in the third quarter as utilities rebuild stockpiles into the third quarter, we are facing some difficult comps now. By the time we get to the fourth quarter it gets a little bit easier and we would expect to see lesser year over year volume declines. On the export side of the franchises as we discussed the comparisons really get easier in the second half, beginning in the second half and again particularly the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter of 2014 export \u2013 total export tonnage was 4.8 million, dropped below 5 million by the fourth quarter of last year. So tough middle part of the year, tough couple of quarters coming, by the fourth quarter we start to see growth. Cleo Zagrean : Can you say maybe if you face specific challenges in your franchise compared to your peers and how we can think about the operating ratio impact? Jim Squires : No, we don\u2019t we face peculiar, particular challenges relative to our competitors in this regard. Cleo Zagrean : Also on your operating ratio, if you would like to quantify or maybe just say that you are prepared for this to maybe assess the impact of coal, that\u2019s fine but on the ex-coal, ex the fuel surcharge hit this year, would you comment as to whether you see mix just below the top line being the tailwind or headwind on the operating income level? I mean we are focusing too much on the top line but surely there must be benefit in growing intermodal and merchandise right, if you can help seeing that for us, that would be very helpful. Jim Squires : Absolutely and we said in the past and it\u2019s still true today that our general merchandise business is particularly volume moving in our scheduled network, or our highest incremental margin businesses. You layer it on top of the natural spontaneous favorable economics of volume growth in this business significant core price increases and that\u2019s really a key driver of improvement for now. Now much of this unfortunately will be masked in the middle part of the year by the fuel surcharge headwinds which will be significant and with the kinds of deltas to last year we are talking about in the top line from fuel surcharge alone, we will probably see margin pressure in the second and third quarter unlike in the first quarter where the decline in fuel expense actually exceeded the fuel surcharge reduction. That will slip most likely given the magnitude of the fuel surcharge revenue headwind in the second and third quarters. End of Q& A Operator : At this time I will turn the floor back to Wick Moorman for closing comments. Wick Moorman : Well thanks everyone for bearing with us on what has been a somewhat long call but hopefully we have given you a lot of data and a lot of color on what we are doing. We appreciate your time and we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and we thank you for your participation.",

Welcome to Norfolk Southern Corporation Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Katie Cook, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Ms. Cook. You may now begin. Katie U. Cook - Director- Investor Relations : Thank you, Rob, and good morning. Before we begin today's call, I would like to mention a few items. First, the slides of the presenters are available on our website at norfolksouthern.com in the Investors section. Additionally, transcripts and downloads of today's call will be posted on our website. Please be advised that during this call, we may make certain forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially from those projected. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. Additionally, keep in mind that all references to reported results excluding certain adjustments, that is non-GAAP numbers, have been reconciled on our website in the Investors section. Now, it is my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's CEO and President, Jim Squires. James A. Squires - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Katie. Good morning and welcome to Norfolk Southern's second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. With me today are our Chief Marketing Officer, Alan Shaw; our Chief Operating Officer, Mark Manion; and our Chief Financial Officer, Marta Stewart. Now, let's go straight to the financial results. Our reported second quarter earnings were $1.41 per share, 21% lower than last year's record results. The decrease was largely due to lower coal volumes and lower fuel surcharge revenues. These are challenging conditions, but there's some good news as our business mix undergoes a significant change. Our intermodal volumes top last year's second quarter record levels. And our merchandise volumes were up for the quarter as well despite pressure in the steel market. Moreover, revenue per unit, excluding fuel surcharges, was positive for merchandise as well as for intermodal, which was even more positive than the first quarter. Alan will provide more detail on our revenue for the second quarter and outlook for the remainder of 2015. I'm proud to report that our service improved significantly during the second quarter. Our composite service metric, an internal measure we use to assess network performance is approaching 80%. And this quarter, we will continue progress toward the higher-service levels achieved in 2012 and 2013. We remain firmly committed to continued service improvement and Mark will share the latest on our service and operations outlook. Marta will wrap up the presentations with a full review of our financial results. Before getting into the specifics, let me emphasize that we are confident in our long-term strategy and our prospects for growth and strong financials. We have a solid franchise and the right team in place to execute our strategy to be a top performer in the industry. On that note, I will turn the program over to Alan, Mark, and Marta, and will return with some closing comments before taking your questions. Alan? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, Jim, and good morning to everyone. I'll begin by providing context to our long-term focus from a sales and marketing perspective. And then I'll review our second quarter performance and our outlook for the balance of the year and beyond. With our diverse portfolio, we are well-positioned to capitalize on the broad structural changes in the U.S. economy. Our extensive intermodal network and strategic corridor investments have enhanced our position in truck competitive markets where demographics and regulatory action will constrain truck capacity, highway congestion will increase, and the economics will continue the momentum of highway conversions to rail. Within the energy arena, we benefit from the movement of crude oil to the East Coast refinery complex as well as increased natural gas drilling within the Marcellus-Utica region, driving inputs of sand and pipe and outputs of natural gas liquids. While reduced commodity prices have tempered 2015 growth, this will continue as a significant market for us. Similarly, our coal franchise, which has been impacted by lower market prices this year, will remain an important part of our business. In manufacturing, the United States has substantially improved its cost competitiveness in terms of wages, productivity, and energy cost. While foreign exchange is impacting some production, the overall picture for U.S. manufacturing is still one of expansion and NS is well positioned to benefit as our service region covers 65% of the manufacturing in the United States. In housing, recent data is supportive of the view that home sales and new home construction will be growth areas with expectations for housing starts to be up more than 10% this year and continued growth projected for 2016 and beyond. Our team will pursue strategic and innovative solutions and partnership with our customers allowing NS to capitalize on these market opportunities that generate revenue growth. Improved service will provide increase capacity on our network and enhance the value of our product, aiding our efforts to convert additional highway freight to rail and achieve market-based pricing gains that we expect to exceed the cost of rail inflation. Additionally, we will endeavor to reduce volatility from fuel surcharge structures. As previously discussed, we have near-term headwinds notably from declining coal and fuel surcharge revenues. However, we will lap these comps, which coupled with the strength in the markets just referenced, affords us great opportunity for future growth. Now, let's turn to our second quarter performance. Marta will provide complete quarterly financial results later on the call, but I would like to discuss operating revenue as you can see on slide three. Overall, you will note the negative impact of the declining fuel and coal revenue. However, the positive aspect is that volume and revenue per unit excluding fuel increased for both merchandise and intermodal. On slide four, you will note that facing very strong comparisons with second quarter 2014, the overall volume declined 2% with growth in intermodal and merchandise driven by increased consumer spending, energy outputs, stronger housing starts and automotive production. These gains were more than offset by a 21% decline in coal. As expected, coal faced a particularly tough comparison against prior-year volume, which I will talk about more on the next slide. Coal revenue declined 33% to $453 million for the quarter with revenue per unit down 14%. Low natural gas prices depressed Eastern coal burn by 15% in the first two months of the second quarter, which reduced utility coal volume by 23%. A strong dollar and global oversupply led to a 38% decline in export coal volumes. As shown on slide six, coal market conditions will continue to challenge our coal volumes for the remainder of 2015. Natural gas price projections below $3 per million btu have impacted coal burn and current stockpile levels will present headwinds for utility deliveries. We continue with our guidance of a run rate of roughly 20 million tons per quarter. Export coals are challenged due to foreign exchange rates and global oversupply, and we believe our run rate will fall to an estimated 3 million tons per quarter. Moving to our intermodal markets, pricing gains continue to create an improvement in revenue per unit excluding fuel. Domestic volumes were effectively flat against last year's strong comps due to West Coast port issues impacting transcontinental freight coupled with temporary headwinds associated with rail service performance and increased truck capacity. Our international units grew 8% in the quarter benefiting from West Coast port issues as some vessel traffic shifted to the East Coast, a conversion we expect to continue. While current truck capacity and lower fuel prices have limited near-term growth in the market, contract rates in the truck market continue to climb. This environment, particularly as our service product continues to improve, bodes well for intermodal pricing moving forward. Moving on to merchandise on slide eight, volume grew 1% in the second quarter. Excluding fuel, revenue per unit also increased as solid pricing partially offset the negative effect of fuel surcharges. Metals and construction volume was down 6% for the quarter driven by global oversupply in the steel market and the impact of low natural gas prices on drilling inputs. Aggregates were up due to construction growth in the Southeast. Our agriculture volume decreased 1% primarily due to reduced volumes of fertilizers and wheat while ethanol volumes grew from greater gasoline consumption. A 13% gain in chemicals volume was due to crude by rail as well as year-over-year growth in natural gas liquids from Marcellus-Utica shale plays. Automotive volume was up 2% with stronger vehicle production. Finally, paper and forest products volume was up 2%, resulting from a rise in consumer spending and the housing recovery. Let me close today with an overview of our expectations. In the near-term, foreign exchange rates and low-commodity prices will negatively impact coal, crude oil, and steel volumes. Combined with the overhang of fuel surcharges and despite expected continued improvement in core pricing, we expect third quarter and fourth quarter revenues will trail last year. Even with these shorter-term challenges, our diverse franchise presents rich opportunities for volume and revenue growth in key markets through the balance of 2015 and beyond. We expect growth within our intermodal markets, and our international volumes will benefit from organic growth at East Coast ports. Longer-term, truck capacity constraints coupled with the increasing demand in economics will drive highway conversions. The energy markets, we anticipate more corn and ethanol shipments due to rising levels of gasoline consumption as well as project-related growth. And our natural gas liquids market will see continued strength from fractionators in the Marcellus-Utica region. With North American light vehicle production projected to be up 3% year-over-year, we expect continued growth in automotive volumes. Lumber, plastics, basic chemicals, aggregates and consumer goods will all benefit from increased housing starts and construction activity. As we cycle the near-term challenges from decline in coal and fuel surcharge revenues, we are well-positioned for and excited about our prospects moving forward. Thank you for your attention. And I will now turn the presentation over to Mark for an update on operations. Mark D. Manion - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to update you this morning on the state of our railroad, which has shown nice improvement. But first, I'll update you on safety. We continue to strengthen our safety process through the engagement of our people and the ownership they take for safety. The safety of our employees, our customers' freight, and the communities we serve have been and will continue to be at the core of everything we do. Our reportable injury ratio for the second quarter was 0.96 and stands at 1.04 for the first half of the year. This is down compared to the first half of last year, which was 1.23. As you see, our train accident rate is up slightly year-over-year while our crossing accident rate was down slightly. Now, let's take a look at our service. We told you on the last call that we'd turn the corner with our service and we expected the service composite performance to be near 80% by the end of the quarter. For the month of June, we operated in the mid-90%s and actually achieved a composite performance of 79% on June 30. Looking at the graph on the right, you can see the improved performance from first quarter to second quarter, and again from second quarter to third quarter. Clearly, we're trending in the right direction and our customer service is reflecting that. Nevertheless, we're not satisfied with where we are and our team is working hard to further increase our composite performance and reach a higher velocity. Train speed and terminal dwell are improving as well. Our speed of 22.5 miles an hour for the week ending July 10 was our highest speed in over a year. Our weekly dwell numbers have been below 25 hours for seven consecutive weeks, which has not happened since July 2014. Our resources have come online as expected and we are consequently seeing our metrics improve in a predictable pattern. As the momentum continues through the second half of the year, our focus will be on further improving our service levels and maintaining the right resource balance. Turning to the next slide with regard to crews, we've come a long way to ramping up areas where we were short. On the slide, you can see a net increase in conductors in the first quarter and second quarter where we were replenishing locations where we were shorthanded. We're continuing to fill in shortage areas in the third quarter, but new hiring is tapering back to a normalized level. Hiring going forward will be in line with attrition. On the locomotive side, we've almost completed the receipt of the SD90MACs. In addition, improvement in system velocity has been another driver in our higher locomotive availability. This is allowing us to store some of our locomotives, which will lead to a surge fleet and better reliability for the locomotives left operating. In closing, we're very encouraged that our resources are coming in balance with our business volume and our operating metrics are trending favorably. We're tightening our belt as we move through the second half. Increased velocity will help us make more efficient use of manpower as well as locomotives and our car fleet. We look forward to continued improvement in our customer service through the rest of the year. Thank you. And now, I'll turn it over to you, Marta. Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : Thank you, Mark, and good morning. Let's take a look at our second quarter financials. Slide two presents our operating results where we faced strong headwinds compared with the record-setting second quarter of 2014. As Alan discussed, the effects of sustained lower-fuel surcharges and continuing challenges in the coal markets drove operating revenues down $329 million or 11%. Nearly three-quarters of the revenue decline was due to lower-fuel revenue which totaled $119 million for the second quarter, and based on current oil price forecast, is expected to be a similar amount for both the third quarter and the fourth quarter. Operating expenses declined by $124 million, which only partially offset the lower revenues resulting in a 20% reduction in income from railway operations and a 70% operating ratio. The next slide shows the major components of the $124 million or 6% net decrease in expenses. Total operating cost benefited from lower fuel prices and favorability in the materials and other categories. Now, let's take a look at each of these areas. As shown on slide four, fuel expense decreased by $153 million or 38%. A lower average price accounted for most of the decline. Reduced consumption added another $5 million of favorability as gallons used were down 1.5% on the 2% decline in overall volume. Materials and other costs shown on the next slide decreased by $13 million or 5%. Lower environmental expenses and favorable personal injury experience totaled $20 million for the quarter. Additionally, material usage, primarily for locomotive, declined by $7 million. Partially offsetting these decreases were increased travel and relocation expenses. Going forward, we expect continued favorability related to locomotive materials in the third quarter. However, it will be fully offset by the impact of the costs associated with the closure of the Roanoke, Virginia offices. We incurred approximately $5 million in the second quarter related to Roanoke relocations, and we expect to incur an additional $30 million over the remainder of the year with the majority of these costs affecting the third quarter. Moving on to purchased services and rents expense, our costs increased by $24 million or 6%. Higher volume-related and service recovery costs, primarily associated with intermodal operations, equipment rents and joint facilities combined to account for $20 million of the increase, of which we estimate about $5 million was related to the service recovery effort. Expenses associated with software costs were also higher in the quarter. Slide seven details the $9 million or 1% increase in compensation cost. Although a relatively small net variance, it was comprised of a number of significant items as listed on the slide. The first two, increased pay rates and higher payroll taxes were, as we previously discussed, front-end loaded this year. The pay rate increase totaled $27 million but will begin to moderate in the second half of the year to around $17 million per quarter. The payroll tax increase was $13 million and should moderate to about $8 million per quarter. The next two items were largely service recovery-related. An increased number of trainees accounted for $10 million of additional wages. As Mark mentioned, we have turned the corner on our hiring efforts and trainee expenses should begin to decrease in the second half of the year. Additionally, we incurred $6 million in higher labor hours as crew starts were up, notwithstanding the drop in volume. Partially offsetting these costs were lower incentive and stock-based accruals down $47 million and driven by the decline in financial results. Next is depreciation expense, which increased by $9 million or 4% reflective of our larger capital base. With regard to capital spending for the remainder of the year, and given the lower-than-expected volumes, we have trimmed back our 2015 capital budget by $130 million or about 5%. Two-thirds of the reductions are related to work on our line of road and one-third is related to equipment. Slide nine presents our income taxes for the quarter, which had an effective rate of 38.1% compared to 37.4% in 2014. The slight increase in the effective rate is principally related to lower returns on corporate-owned life insurance. Assuming normalized returns on these assets in the second half of the year, we expect the full year rate to be about 37.5%. Slide 10 shows our bottom-line results with net income of $433 million, down 23% compared with 2014, and diluted earnings per share of $1.41, down 21% versus last year. Wrapping up our financial overview on slide 11, cash from operations for the first six months was $1.5 billion covering capital spending and producing $587 million in free cash flow. With respect to stockholder returns, we repurchased $765 million of our shares year-to-date and paid $360 million in dividend. Thank you. And I'll now turn the program back to Jim. James A. Squires - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: As you've heard this morning, we expect continued pressure in the short term, particularly in the third quarter and to some extent in the fourth quarter from lower coal volumes and lower fuel surcharge revenues. On the positive side, we expect service will continue to improve and better service will help us grow. As we pursue growth in a changing mix environment, we're working to improve our train performance by further enhancing and innovating our supply chain integration with customers and employees and by leveraging technology. And we're committed to coordinating service capacity and capital investment along with pricing and volume growth to maximize returns for our shareholders. In addition, we'll continue to capitalize on market opportunities that enhance our network capacity and efficiency as with our pending acquisition of rail lines from the Delaware & Hudson Railway Company. And as we do so, we are committed to reinvesting in our franchise and returning cash to our shareholders. In sum, we have strong prospects for future growth. Intermodal and merchandise growth increased consumer spending and rebounding housing markets and improved manufacturing activity all support an optimistic longer-term outlook. While we do face challenges in the short term in 2015, we have a strong legacy of success and we're confident we're taking the right steps to continue creating value for our customers, the communities we serve, our employees, and of course, our shareholders. Thank you for your attention. I'll turn it back to the moderator, so we can take your questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Due to the number of analysts joining us on the call today, we'll be limiting everyone to one primary question and one follow-up question to accommodate as many participants as possible. Thank you. Our first question is from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your questions. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Good morning. In terms of the service performance, when do you expect to have the network back in balance? And could you quantify for us the impact of the inefficiencies in the second quarter? James A. Squires - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. It's Jim. Let me take a first stab at that. We've made significant improvements in service in the second quarter. Velocity and terminal dwell are both trending favorably and we're making a lot of headway on our internal composite service metric as well. So we continue to \u2013 we expect that trend to continue in the second half as well, in the third quarter and through the fourth quarter. And that will continue to be our goal to push service ever higher. Mark, would you like to comment next? Mark D. Manion - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Only to say we've made a lot of progress. I mean if you think about it what we've accomplished so far, we're about 90% of the way toward our \u2013 what has been our historical high in the past. And we have every intention of getting all the way there, so. James A. Squires - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Marta, why don't you comment on the resource implications in the second half? Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : Yes. We had estimated that our service-related costs in the second quarter would $25 million. And it turns out that that estimate was pretty much dead on. We \u2013 most of that \u2013 we estimate that most of that is in compensation and benefits. $15 million of the $25 million is there. I talked about the two major things in that $15 million. And that is the higher-than-usual level of trainees, which we expect some of that to continue into the third quarter and the other one is additional labor hours. The remaining $10 million of service-recovery costs are scattered in various categories in about $3 million to $4 million increments. We have a little bit more fuel than we would have had otherwise. Our equipment rents were impacted by about $3 million due to the velocity, and then purchase services and travel cost. So those are all the components of the $25 million. Going forward, Allison, we think that we will just have about $5 million of that hanging over into the third quarter. And that is primarily, as Mark described, as we work our trainees into our regular qualified fleet, we still will have a slightly elevated level of training. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Great. Thank you. And just my follow-up question, what was the split between export met and thermal coal during the second quarter? And do you have any sense of what you're thinking for this in the second half? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey, Allison, this is Alan. The split was about three-quarters met, and one-quarter steam thermal coal. And going forward, we've got it down to about 3 million tons per quarter, and it's going to be a function of foreign exchange rates. And the two indices that we watch closely which are the Queensland Coking Coal for met and then the API 2 for thermal. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Excellent. Thank you so much for the time. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions. Alexander Vecchio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning. It's Alex Vecchio in for Bill. So you mentioned that you expect the domestic utility coal to run about 20 million tons per quarter and you lowered the export coal run rate to about 3 million tons. You also talked a little bit about some other commodities. But when we kind of take it all together can you give us a sense of what's embedded in your expectations for total volumes on a year-over-year basis in the back half of 2015? Do you think 4Q volumes might be positive on an easier comp, or should we be expecting kind of volume declines to persist for the balance of the year? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : We see some fundamental growth in many of our markets, which we expect to continue into the second half of the year. The overhang we're going to see is the fuel surcharge revenue that Marta referenced, which is going to kind of mask the core pricing gains and the volume growth that we're seeing in other markets. Alexander Vecchio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Do you have a sense for like how the total carloads might track, though, in the back half? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : We expect that it'll be up over last year. Alexander Vecchio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That's helpful. And then just specifically on the lowered expectations for 4Q revenues to be actually down year-over-year instead of I think slightly up was your prior expectation. Is that entirely attributable to either the export coal and fuel surcharge or are there other areas that kind of contributed to that slightly lower outlook on the fourth quarter? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Good question. The other primary driver of that would be reduced crude oil volumes. And you can see that very easily as you take a look at Brent and WTI pricing. Alexander Vecchio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks very much for the time. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your questions. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey. Thanks. Morning. James A. Squires - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Morning, Scott. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : So, Marta, you guys have been giving a little bit more transparency, which has been helpful. Wondering if you have a comfort kind of telling us that second quarter is the bottom for earnings and we should see sequential earnings improvement from second quarter to third quarter or if maybe from a margin standpoint, we see less of a margin headwind from \u2013 in third quarter than we did in second quarter, if you feel comfortable there. And then maybe specifically on the $47 million of lower incentive and stock-based comp, do you have any rough guidance on that for the third quarter and fourth quarter? Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : Okay. Well, let me start with the second question first. The stock-based comp did have a very large decrease in the second quarter of this year, and that's primarily because of the comp with the second quarter of last year. As you know, that was an all-time high quarter for us and so the accruals that quarter were very high, therefore, the relative comparisons. Going forward into the third quarter and fourth quarter, we think we still will have favorable comparisons in that line item, but they won't be to the degree they were in the second quarter. And then moving on to the rest of the year, kind of overall, and I think it's really driven by the things Alan discussed with coal and crude. But we expect that some of the comps will get a little bit easier otherwise, and so, we do expect a somewhat of an improvement going into the back half. Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Volume comps will improve as we get deeper into the second half of the year. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe one last one for Jim or Alan, just big picture as I think back the past five years or so. You guys have seen some of the better volume growth in the industry, but yield growth has lagged the other rails. Do you see that changing or the focus changing where you start to get more pricing and maybe sacrifice a little bit of volume going forward? James A. Squires - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Scott, it's Jim. Yeah. I think you put your finger on the issue in the second quarter in particular, and for the balance of the year, albeit the next couple of quarters ought to be less worse. And so, yes, we certainly are going to lean into revenue per unit growth. The encouraging thing about even the second quarter was outside of coal, growth in revenue ex-fuel surcharge impacts, and we would expect that to continue for the balance of the year. So we're seeing that positive trend in overall mix. And we're going to continue to push on that along with core pricing. We're satisfied with the level of core price increases that we have experienced so far this year. And we're going to continue to push that based on market conditions at a rate better than real cost inflation. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Thank you, guys. Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : Welcome. Operator : Our next question is from the line of John Barnes with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions. John Barnes - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. A couple of things on the service side, going back there for just a second. You talked about crew starts still being up in the quarter despite carloads being down on a year-over-year basis. Are you getting towards a better ratio of crew starts to carloads and is that where you start to see that improvement from, say, that $25 million drag to the $5 million drag on the efficiency cost? James A. Squires - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Mark, why don't you take that one? Mark D. Manion - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Okay. I'd be glad to. We are seeing improvement particularly as we got into the latter part of May and June. And we think that we'll continue to see improvement as the velocity of the railroad picks up and obviously helps the crew starts. We really, in a big way, reduced our re-crews these last couple of months. We feel that trend will continue. John Barnes - RBC Capital Markets LLC : All right. Very well. And then, lastly, as my follow-up, the other rails have all \u2013 as part of their earnings announcements \u2013 have been pretty vocal about furloughs and locomotives and storage. You didn't provide really near the degree of color around that. Is it that you haven't really started the furlough plan yet? Is it that you're still winding through and dealing with the service so you haven't yet started that? And the same thing on locos, I mean, it sounds like you put some in storage, but can you give us a feel for maybe the numbers in storage and where you stand on just resources kind of in the pipeline? Mark D. Manion - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Sure. I'd be glad to. First of all, on the locomotive side, we have begun storing. We're at about 50 locomotives in storage right now. And we're going to be able to continue storing. I'd like to see us get up in the 200 range, not sure just how quickly we can do that, but that's the plan. And again as the velocity improves, it'll help us do that. On the crews side, we haven't furloughed because we haven't had the need to furlough. We're trying to be really measured and balanced as far as the hiring goes. And we're getting this, as I indicated in the remarks, we are reaching that point where we are about at a balance and we are tapering off on the hiring now. But \u2013 and we will probably see \u2013 we're beginning to see indications in just very few select spots where there would be a possibility of furlough going forward, but I don't think it's going to be a big number. And if you look back through history, our number on the furlough side just hasn't been quite as high as what some of the other railroads experience. So we'll see how it goes. But I don't think we're going to have a big furlough number. We're trying to hire the right number of people. James A. Squires - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I would characterize our resource plan in the second half as one of stabilization. And you heard Mark say earlier that we're trending towards attrition-based hiring in the second half. Similarly, we're starting to put locomotives up. We have a few more units coming online, but very few. And we can pivot on resources if we have to. If we see the trend in car loadings moving against us, then we can obviously pivot quickly in resources. And we demonstrated that in the second quarter by reducing our capital spending for the year as Marta mentioned now, and we're doing so without hurting the long-term prospects of the enterprise or really disrupting our reinvestment plan. But we certainly can modulate resources and we will if necessary. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please go ahead with your questions. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hey. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Can you maybe comment a little bit more about pricing? You kind of highlighted that sequentially. I think we saw a bit of a step-up in the pricing dynamic. I just wanted to get a rough sense of sort of maybe how big is \u2013 what the magnitude of that was and maybe how you think about sort of the opportunity. How much more do we have as we go through this year? Does it still feel like sort of the underlying businesses where you are getting growth or still relatively ripe for that? James A. Squires - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Chris. I will let Alan address that. Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Certainly. Chris, we are seeing market-based pricing that is generally above rail inflation. And the good point for us is that we're seeing it in our growth markets. We're seeing it in intermodal where our RPU was up \u2013 ex-fuel, was up 3% in the second quarter. And we expect that kind of growth to continue. There's a latent demand for rail capacity out there. And the prices that we're putting out into the market are holding and we expect that to continue. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. That's helpful. And then when you think about the buyback in the second half of the year, you've stepped forward, I think, in the first half, so far and bought back a decent amount of shares. I guess when you think about sort of the second half outlook, should we expect more of the same? Just want to get a rough sense at these levels or how you see that opportunity playing out. James A. Squires - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Marta, why don't you take that one? Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : So, we have previously guided to a full year share buyback of $1.2 billion and we're still on track for that. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. So that's the way we should think about the back half. Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : That's correct. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thanks for the time. I appreciate it. Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead with your questions. Jason H. Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you very much and good morning, everyone. I wanted to touch on intermodal a little bit. You referred to it, obviously, as one of your growth markets, and obviously, it's done well over the last couple years. Wanted to ask, have you guys lost a little share back to the trucking market? We've seen some of the major truckload carriers add a little capacity out here and the East is a little bit more competitive. James A. Squires - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We'll let Alan address the specifics of the volume trend in the second quarter. But let me just say intermodal will continue to be one of our growth opportunities \u2013 truckload diversions in general both intermodally and in our merchandise sectors as well. And the other really encouraging thing about the intermodal revenue trend now is the increase in revenue per unit, as Alan mentioned earlier. Alan? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Number one, we are facing pretty difficult comps. Our intermodal franchise grew 11% in the second quarter of last year. And so, we posted growth on top of that. Truck capacity, as you noted, has improved, but it still trails demand. And you can see that empirically in the fact that truckload pricing continues to move up, which gives us not only a good outlook for what our volumes are going to look like long term, but also what our price is going to look like. We are seeing really strong growth on our internationals segment where our customers are shifting more volume to our East Coast partners. So that's a bonus for us. And long term, we feel really good about our intermodal market with respect to growth opportunities in both volume and in pricing. Jason H. Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC: And that stuff that shifted to the East Coast, how sticky do you think that business is going to be for Norfolk? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Some of it is. Certainly, there will be some that moves back to the West Coast, which is only natural but the percentage of volume move into the East Coast ports while it was in the very low-30%s will probably move up to 33%, 34%. So there's growth opportunity for our East Coast ports. Jason H. Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC: Perfect. A little follow-up here for Marta. Marta, I think you alluded to the fact that your relocation cost for Roanoke was $5 million in the quarter. And I think you said you expect $30 million for the remainder of the year at most in 3Q. If you exclude those relocation costs in 3Q, how should we look at sort of your margins on a sequential basis for the railroad? Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : I think the \u2013 and Mark can speak more to, has spoken more to how the system, we expect the fluidity to improve. So I think the main thing that you will see is that those service recovery costs that we quantified at $25 million in the second quarter, we only expect $5 million of those as we work through our higher levels of trainees to remain in the third quarter. So you should expect the others to fall off : the extra overtime, the extra re-crews that he spoke about, that sort of thing. Those we do not expect to continue in the second half. Jason H. Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. So, sequentially, if we exclude the Roanoke cost, it should look okay compared to 2Q then? Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : Yes. Jason H. Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC: Fantastic. Thank you for your time as always. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please go ahead with your questions. Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Yeah. Good morning. So, I wanted to focus a little more on seasonality now that you've reported a full quarter with the fuel surcharge headwind, and presumably as steep as it can get with the WTI-based programs with the $64 trigger now at zero. The volume trend on a year-over-year basis seems to be stabilizing; the service levels are improving as you talked about earlier. So, looking forward, second half is consistently seasonally stronger than the first half for you guys. But the Street consensus is modeling second half versus first half earnings increased at a pretty steep level. It looks like the steepest since 2009. So, just from a high level, do you think \u2013 are you looking for an above seasonal outcome in the second half year? James A. Squires - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, Bascome as we said earlier, we do expect second half results to be less worse than we experienced in the first half. However, we still do face some significant headwinds, particularly in the third quarter. Fuel surcharge revenue in the third quarter of last year was still running strong, just below second quarter fuel surcharge levels in 2014 \u2013 pardon me, just above so actually, it's a little bit tougher headwind in the third quarter. In addition, we do have the extra Roanoke-related expenses we flagged. In other areas of expenses, we would expect a more favorable trend. Alan, would you like to comment? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. I think, that we are going to see \u2013 we'll have better comps in the fourth quarter with respect to volume than we will in the third quarter. And we're still right now exposed to foreign exchange risk and the prices \u2013 mainly the commodities that we handle, and we see that with coal and \u2013 with coal, crude oil and steel right now. Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : All right. Thanks for the color, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Rob Salmon with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question. Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey. Thanks. If I could turn the discussion a little bit back to the intermodal side of the business particularly the domestic side, how much do you think that, in terms of the volume growth deceleration, was a result of some of the pricing initiatives, service not being quite where you guys wanted, although it's continuing to get better as well as just some softer broad-based demand that we saw last quarter. James A. Squires - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Alan, why don't you comment on that? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. As we take a look at our second quarter domestic intermodal business, I think the headwinds and the factors that limited our growth are temporary. Number one is the West Coast port issue. As you were probably aware, much of or a high percentage of the volume that comes in the West Coast in 40-foot containers gets re-stuffed into 53-foot boxes and moves transcon, anywhere between 25% and 40%. That would show up normally in our domestic volumes, but did not this quarter. So that was a limiting factor, particularly early in the quarter. And then while we didn't lose business to truck due to service, it limited our ability to grow. And we're working hard, we're improving our service, and we think that will be behind us. Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And do you think that some of the pricing initiatives that you guys kind of undertook did have an impact one way or the other in terms of the domestic volumes? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : No. We see that truckload pricing is actually up this year. Our customers are increasing their pricing. And so, it's just the overall healthy environment for pricing and the truck market right now. It's just not growing as much as it did this time last year. Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And would you expect pricing as we look out to next year to be in line with kind of what you're experiencing this year? Or do you expect that to potentially improve, given the better service proposition? Or are you a little bit cautious about some of the more balanced supply/demand in the truckload marketplace? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. I'll address that long term. We feel that the fundamentals are there for long term for increased demand for highway-to-rail conversions. We're taking a long-term view of this as our customers when we sit down and we figure out our relationship going forward and the need to ensure rail capacity and pricing. Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: All right. Thanks so much for the time. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Matt Troy with Nomura Securities. Please go ahead with your questions. Matt Troy - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just wanted to ask a question about intermodal and specifically the peak season. We've heard mix messages across the freight ecosystem about an inventory build in retail. We've certainly heard that from retail as substantially impacting volumes in June. Some folks expressing optimism, if you will, about a peak season perhaps being a little bit later, but it's just that optimism. I was just wondering based on the hard and real conversations you're having with your customers, what's your sense for the traditional peak? I know it's flattened in the last several years, but is it something that we should expect to see emerge in the third quarter? Is the initial read that it will be somewhat disappointing? I just wanted to get a sense of what your planning was given the resources on the network and your conversations with customers. James A. Squires - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks and good morning, Matt. Alan, what's your sense of peak? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, as Matt had noted, it's relatively flat now and it's spread over the entire year over the last couple of years. Generally, peak, for us, has been associated with their national volumes that largely shows up in August and September. And as we've noted, our international volumes are really healthy right now. We've got a good franchise; customers are shifting more international volume to the East Coast ports. So there's opportunity for growth for us in the \u2013 in August and September in our international franchise. Matt Troy - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Okay. And that international share gain obviously contributing to that, just \u2013 I'm wondering if you could help us, from a mix perspective, is that comparable in terms of length of haul versus when you're getting hand-off traffic from the West Coast carriers? Is it mix negative in that it might be a little bit shorter or is it moving further inland and actually into West Coast markets? Just wondering about that share gain and just what it meant from a mix implication on that Newport volume that have been diverted. Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. I wouldn't say it's negative. It does allow us to generate more revenue density on a train and to the extent that we can provide more efficient service associated with that, then it certainly makes it more truck competitive. Matt Troy - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Okay. Got it. Thank you, everybody. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question. Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Good morning. Alan, just a little bit on the \u2013 on coal again. Just \u2013 you've seen accelerating downtick on your volumes overall \u2013 total volumes, almost 4% quarter-to-date. So is there anything dragging coal down further given you're down about 20% quarter-to-date? I get the 3 million ton outlook on international and that accelerates to \u2013 down, I don't know, 40%, 45% year-on-year. But are we seeing something on the domestic side? Maybe you could address on the utilities side a little bit. Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : All right. Ken, I think we're still going to hold firm with our projection of 20 million tons for domestic. That will be \u2013 and that's over the next 18 months to 24 months. So, it's going to be subject to weather conditions and just general demand. But, no, we really haven't seen anything right now on the domestic debt is any more alarming than what we've already guided to. Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : But you are seeing an accelerating down \u2013 I mean, right, we are seeing an acceleration on the downside? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : For the first couple of weeks of this quarter, our domestic volumes are down versus last year, but we still feel good about 20 million tons for the quarter. Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then on the domestic side, I just want to revisit the individual lanes; can you talk about growth on the Crescent versus the Heartland and kind of where you're seeing that? Are you seeing growth differentials between the different lanes? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : We are seeing \u2013 our primary growth drivers right now are on Crescent and on Heartland. Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Can you provide us the updates like you used to on percentages, or do you no longer provide that level of detail? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : We've seen Crescent and Heartland quarter volumes along with other targeted quarter volumes rise in line with the trends that we have seen the last couple of quarters if I recall. So, for example, Crescent was up 6% in the quarter, better than the overall domestic intermodal trend, Heartland was up 2%. Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Just if I can follow up on the first one, Alan, just to let it go at this, but if we are at 20 million tons on domestic, I just want to understand, is that utility and steel and industrial or are you talking 20 million utility alone? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Ken, that would be 20 million utility alone. Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. So then, you're \u2013 just if you get the 3 million tons and 20 million utility \u2013 okay. Just there's quite a large differential between where you're trending now. So you're looking for a pretty big snap up in the last two months of the quarter, I guess, then? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes. Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. All right. Thanks for the time. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please go ahead with your question. Brian Colley - Stephens, Inc.: Morning. This is actually Brian Colley on the call for Justin. So just wanted to talk about the negative mix impact we're seeing from coal, particularly with intermodal being the largest driver to carload increases for the rails. If this trend doesn't really have an end in sight, are there structural changes or pricing efforts where we could see you get more aggressive in order to mitigate this negative mix impact? James A. Squires - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, we certainly did see an effect from mix at a high level in the second quarter. And with coal being down as much as it was, that creates a challenge for us in terms of improving margin and growing the bottom line. With that said, our longer-term outlook is for coal volumes to stabilize. And now, we've guided down on the export side of the business for the foreseeable future. Now, that's been historically a very volatile part of the business. But the good news is, we think that we have seen and are at the bottom in terms of utility coals \u2013 the volume may vary from quarter-to-quarter depending on weather, in particular, but we think $20 million is a reasonable run rate at least for the next 12 months to 18 months or so. So, that would imply stabilization. We'll wait and see. Eventually, we will see supply come out of global market and we should see it boost the export coal volume as well. And that will help with the mix. In the meantime, we're going to grow intermodal, and we will grow merchandise volumes. That's one of three parts to our overall strategy : grow the top lines through pricing based on market conditions at a rate better than rail inflation; grow volume particularly intermodal and merchandise volume profitably. And secondly, we're going to work on return on capital by prioritizing capital spending in favor of revenue growth opportunities and profit margin. And third service. Continuing to improve service is really the key to both the top line growth and better returns on capital as well. Brian Colley - Stephens, Inc.: Thanks. And if I could just follow up real quick on that. I mean, just some of the rails have talked about this incremental margin framework of around 50% longer-term. Is that the right way to think about your business once we start to see volumes increase on a year-over-year basis? And if so, is that incremental margin framework only achievable at coal environment that's at least flat or stabilized? James A. Squires - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We do believe 50% incremental margin is a reasonable goal going forward. Now, that certainly \u2013 it would certainly (54:09) if coal volumes do in fact stabilize. Brian Colley - Stephens, Inc.: Great. Thanks for the time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please proceed with your questions. Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities : Thanks very much, and good morning. I was just wondering if you could offer some thoughts on where you think head count will end the year versus last year. James A. Squires - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Marta? Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : Okay. So, previously, in our January and our April calls, we guided to the fact that we thought we would increase 1,000 in total from the fourth quarter of last year average. And we still think we're on that run rate. So if you look at the fourth quarter of last year to the first quarter of this year, we were up 500, then sequentially the first quarter to the second quarter another 100. So, net we're up 600 through June 30. So we expect that in the third quarter and fourth quarter, we'll be up an additional 400. Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities : Okay. That's helpful. And then I think you have indicated that it's your intention over time to convert to on-highway, diesel-based fuel surcharge programs. Just wondering if you can provide any update on your progress year-to-date on that. James A. Squires - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'll let Alan address that. That is a goal. We recognize that there's been a bit of a mismatch in having our revenues fuel surcharges based on WTI with expense obviously based on diesel prices. So, Alan, why don't you talk about our plan for reducing some of that volatility? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : One way to reduce the volatility would be to shift the benchmark from WTI base to an on-highway diesel. We're going to approach that with our customers as individual contracts expire. The average duration of our contract is a little bit over three years. So it is going to take some time to make a meaningful shift in that. And we are also committed during that time period not to sacrifice market-based pricing for premature shift in the fuel surcharge program. Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities : Okay. Thank you. That's all for me. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your questions. Ben J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah. Thanks. Marta, real quick, could I get your perspective on the dividend? I noticed on Friday the announced dividend for 3Q was flat relative to 2Q. It looked like that was the first time that has been the case sequentially, 2Q to 3Q since 2009. Can you talk about some of the components that drove that decision not to raise the dividend sequentially and maybe just provide perspective on what you expect the dividend policy to be going forward? Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : Well, our dividend policy just overall \u2013 stepping back \u2013 our dividend policy long term is to \u2013 is a one-third payout ratio. So, in the past, we have sometimes raised the dividend in July and sometimes not. So that's not really a departure from what we've done over the years. You're correct that the last couple of years, we have raised in January and July. So we feel comfortable with the $0.59. We feel comfortable where we are with our payout ratio, and then the future of course will be guided by our future profitability. Ben J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein Investment Research. Please go ahead with your questions. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Hey, Alan, maybe just to \u2013 could you talk a little bit about the coal pricing trends in the fuel business, sort of ex-fuel. That number was down a lot \u2013 a little bit more than it has been in the past. I'm just wondering if that was all fuel decline or if you're also seeing some negative mix or some possible price declines in there. Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey, could you repeat that? J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Well, as you think about the coal pricing ex-fuel? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Coal? J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Yeah. Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Okay. Yeah. There were \u2013 we did see a decline in our pricing with respect to coal. A lot of that has to do with mix changes as you know, export tends to be a longer haul move for us than utility. So, a 38% decline in export, coal volumes in the quarter is going to have a disproportionate impact on our overall RPU ex-fuel. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: So it was predominantly mix? There wasn't another step down in export rates or any pricing action on the utility coal business in the quarter? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : I would say, it was \u2013 it's predominantly mix. We're looking at each of our individual moves individually with our customers. And applying market intel and analytics to figure out what drives the best results for our shareholders. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. And then I guess as you think about the volume guidance for the back half of the year, I think you said you're expecting overall volume to be up year-over-year in light of the accelerating coal headwind and crude maybe moderating. Are you expecting a pickup in economic activity? Or is there something specific that you can point to that would give you confidence on the volume growth? Or is it just a case of the comps moderating? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. And let me be clear. That's more towards the fourth quarter of the year than the third quarter. We've got some heavy comps also in the third quarter. Last year, we handled over 24 million tons in the third quarter of the year into our utility market, which may \u2013 going back to Ken's question previously may be one of the reasons he's looking at some pretty hefty negative comps in our coal market. So comps will improve for us. We still see strength in many of the markets that we talked about with respect to intermodal, housing, energy-related, the NGLs out of Marcellus and Utica, and automotive. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. So the \u2013 but from an economic perspective, you're sort of still expecting kind of slow, steady growth? You're not expecting \u2013 you're not hearing anything that would tell you that there's like a reacceleration or anything at the back half? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : No, we're not. And you know the overhang of the oil and gas industry is weighing on manufacturing, but consumer spending is up, but nothing extraordinary. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please go ahead with your questions. Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah. Good morning. Jim, I wanted to ask you a question. It's \u2013 I guess notable, you did lower the CapEx number this year. And I know that sometimes that's tricky to do when you're in the midst of a year and you have to plan these things ahead of time. So that's notable. Do you think your approach in terms of managing the company is going to be a little more aggressive in terms of paring back on CapEx versus maybe what we've seen over the last eight years or so, 10 years? Is that a fair way to look at it? And if so, how would you think about 2016-2017 CapEx? Could those fall a bit from where we're at this year? James A. Squires - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Tom. Let me comment first on the 2016 mid-year reduction. We did make the decision to reduce capital somewhat this year. I wouldn't make too much of it. It was a rather modest 5% reduction, but we saw an opportunity and we jumped on it. We're trying to be disciplined with our capital spending. And as I said, target revenue growth with our CapEx and profit margin. Going forward, we will try to manage capital spending ex-PTC down to about 15% to 17% of sales. Now, that may take a while. That's a big change from the level of capital spending where we've been. But we recognize the need to be judicious with capital reinvestments. We're committed to the business. We're absolutely going to reinvest in core assets on a steady-state basis, but we will also be mindful of the need to drive returns through better capital turnover as well. And that means prioritizing capital toward revenue growth. Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : Right. So that doesn't sound like a big change, but maybe somewhat of a tweak in terms of the way you look at CapEx? James A. Squires - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Right. Exactly. Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And then as a follow-up, and I think, Jim, this is probably for you and for you Alan. What about on pricing? Is there also room for not a major change, but a little bit of a tweak where you say we're going to be a little bit more focused on price versus volume whereas in the past we've been looking at both price and volume, but maybe a little bit more focused on volume? James A. Squires - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I wouldn't say we've held back in terms of our pricing emphasis in the past. So no real change there either. But we are determined to raise prices in line with market opportunities and market conditions at a rate better than rail inflation. That is our goal. We recognize that that's a vital part of growing our top line. Alan, you want to comment on that? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. I would say that, looking forward, particularly in our growth markets, price and volume are not mutually exclusive. We're investing long term. Our customers are \u2013 see the same issues in the trucking industry that we do. And they're looking for long-term partnerships. Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. So, no real change in price versus volume for you guys versus the prior team. Obviously, you're part of the prior team, but I'm just saying given your \u2013 you know you could tweak things on the margin given your new positions. James A. Squires - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Listen, we want both. We want both pricing and volume growth. And we think we can get both. We're going to lean into pricing. We recognize that's critical part of growing the top line. But we see lots of volume growth opportunities out there as well. Truck conversions will continue to be central to our volume growth strategy, and that means intermodal but also carload. So, yes pricing, yes volume growth. Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : Right. Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please go ahead with your questions. Brandon Robert Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question here. Alan, I hate to keep harping on this, but it does look like in the last five weeks or so, and this is really near term, by the way, but your volume run rate has definitely steps below 150,000 units per week. So, from our perspective, it looks like things are sequentially deteriorating. And I know you're calling for sequential improvement. So is there something about the last six months or two months that we shouldn't be that concerned with that will come back in your network as we go through the fourth quarter this year? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : No. I would say we are keeping a very watchful eye on it. And a lot of the decline that we've seen over the last four weeks to six weeks as you've noted has been associated with our export coal franchise, which we've previously discussed. Brandon Robert Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Appreciate that. And, Jim, I guess following up on that line of questions there. Norfolk has seen pretty good volume growth the last five years under Wick, and obviously, the OR was flat. I know you had a lot of coal headwinds through that period. You did say that you think coal markets are at a bottom. But I feel like we've had that conversation on this call for three years or four years now where we think things have bottomed, but then natural gas prices go lower or another external shock happens with coal and we're again facing that same headwind. I'm sure it's not lost on you that your OR is now probably the highest amongst the major railroads here that are publicly-traded. So what can investors expect from you as CEO? Are we going to aggressively attack the OR with cost reductions even if coal doesn't stabilize from here? James A. Squires - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You bet. I mean, we absolutely are determined to lower our operating ratio. I think we have the ability to do so. And let me just reiterate, our strategy here, it's a three parts strategy. The first thing we're going to do is grow the top line. Now, that'll obviously be easier if coal volume stabilize. But we're determined to grow volume and pricing. And secondly, we are going to push on return on capital by prioritizing capital spending around revenue growth, recognizing that it is in capital turnover where we have lagged in the past few years. And third, service is the key to all of this. And I'm really pleased to report that we saw service and network improvements in the second quarter. We expect those to continue in the second half. So, the way we look at it, there's been progress evident on all fronts in terms of the top line growth with the exception of coal which faces clear near-term headwinds. We did see growth in merchandise and intermodal revenue ex-fuel surcharges. So that's very positive. Secondly, in terms of return on capital, longer-term story, but we demonstrated our willingness to take a look at our capital spending plan in the second quarter, and we will continue to do so in line with our previous comments. And third, service is the key of it all, and we saw service improvements in the second quarter, which we expect to persist in the second half. Brandon Robert Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your questions. Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you and good morning. Thanks for taking my call. So, on the strength of merchandise, I just wanted to ask for a bit of characterization of the NGL market opportunity out of the Marcellus and Utica. It looks like chemicals was clearly a good area for carload growth this quarter. How early do you think you are in pursuing that opportunity? Are there other fractionators, other facilities coming online? And maybe from a mix perspective, if you could characterize kind of the length of haul relative to the overall portfolio? James A. Squires - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Alan, why don't you tackle that one? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure. There is additional capacity coming online in the fractionator area, also with current fractionators expanding. And so, we continue to see growth in that. The length of haul is really no different from what else we're handling. I will tell you in the chemical arena, the other headwind we are facing though is crude oil. And that's been another decline for us in the last couple of weeks. So back to the earlier question of what's changed in the last four weeks to six weeks, it's effectively export coal and crude oil. Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. And then just one quick follow-up on coal and maybe just answer some of the questions about the possibility for it to improve in the third quarter and beyond. Where the inventory levels at the utilities? I think in the past quarter is around 70 days for the South, which is right around target. The North was a little bit above where average was. And if you could just update us with those numbers. Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. On average, the utility stockpiles are about 20 days above target, about 25 days up in the North and 15 days in the South. Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And South target is 70 or so and the North is 50 roughly? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Right. Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. All right. Thanks a lot for the color. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead with your questions. Jeff A. Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Thank you very much. Hey, guys. Quick question, I want to go back to the question you had on length of haul and mix in the coal franchise. I understand the export tends to be longer-haul coal and that would be mix impact. But when I'm running the algebra, it looks like your length of haul was down almost 7%, 8% on the coal franchise? I'm just doing basic math dividing revenue ton miles by tons. Can you talk about some of the other mix elements going on? Because I thought the story was we're sourcing more out of Illinois, a little less out of Central App. In theory, that should have been additive to length of haul. So could you discuss a little bit more on what's going on with mix in the coal area? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. We did have some spot moves in the second quarter of last year that were longer length of haul. And our utility South network tends to be a little bit longer length of haul than our utility in North. Jeff A. Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. So that was the primary driver of the mix differential. And does that continue into 3Q? Or was that more of a second quarter effect? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, it depends upon are you comparing it sequentially? Or are you comparing it year-over-year? Jeff A. Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Let's go year-over-year. Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Then I would say that that does continue into the third quarter. Jeff A. Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. And then Ken Hoexter's question similarly, you identified the 20 million as just being domestic utility, the 3 million being export. So, really no change in your view in terms of coke, iron ore or domestic industrial? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Right. Correct. Which also, to your point, tends to be a shorter length of haul. Jeff A. Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Right. And fewer tons per car. Guys, thanks. James A. Squires - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Welcome. Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Cleo Zagrean with Macquarie. Please go ahead with your questions. Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Good morning. Can you hear me all right? James A. Squires - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. Good morning, Cleo. Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Good morning. My first question relates to merchandise yields. With (01:11:27) down 10% year-over-year and a continuation of the first quarter, perhaps down low single-digit ex-fuel. Can you help us understand any change in trend there in terms of mix and same-store sales into the second half and maybe next year? Thank you. James A. Squires - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Cleo, actually, RPU, excluding fuel surcharge in the merchandise segment was favorable in the second quarter. Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: I was referring to revenue-per-ton mile what people may also call yield. James A. Squires - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Revenue-per-ton mile. Well, let me just say that our expectation is that we will see a continuation of core pricing, same-store sales pricing at a rate in line with market conditions and better-than-real inflation. And so, that's a trend that you saw when looking at it at the level of RPU, ex fuel surcharges in the second quarter. And as we've said, we expect that to persist especially in merchandise but also in intermodal in the second half. Alan, did you want to add anything to that? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. I'd say that were some mix impacts. We've seen declines in steel, which we've commented on and frac sand, which didn't have a higher RPU for us. So there's a negative mix impact there. Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. And those maybe should stabilize into year-end? Should we enter some kind of normalized comps next year? James A. Squires - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: These mix impacts come and go. There is no longer-term negative mix trend under way that we can see. There were certainly some mix noise in the first quarter, a little bit in the second quarter as well. But overall, we saw our progress where it counts and that's in revenue per unit growth excluding the effects of fuel surcharges outside of coal. Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: I appreciate it. And then, my follow up relates to the coal outlook longer-term, you said you saw some stabilization 12 months to 18 months out. But as we look to gas capacity additions coming on in 2017 and 2018, do you see a need to potentially adjust your network ahead of that, or you do not see those representing a big threat to the coal volume domestically? Thank you. James A. Squires - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: The outlook gets cloudier the further we go out. And looking beyond 12 months to 18 months, we certainly do see the potential for further encouragement of gas on our network due to new gas-fired generation. And, yes, we will and we are currently looking at our coal related assets, those would fall into a couple of buckets. Our coal car fleet, we had several years ago plans to replace coal cars pretty aggressively. We've basically been able to eliminate that from our capital budget, given the trend in coal volumes. Our coal track network is certainly under review as well and we have other coal facilities that we're taking a look at, looking out even beyond the 12 months to 18 months. Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: I greatly appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Tom Kim of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question. Tom Kim - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey. Good morning. Thanks. I had a couple of questions on intermodal. I guess, just first off on the international side, we obviously have seen that the big benefit with the West Coast port disruptions the effect of it being resolved. And I guess as we look forward to the second half of the year, what do you think a reasonable growth rate for international intermodal should be? I mean, would it be safe to assume something close to GDP is sort of reasonable? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Typically, we've said that international will grow at 1 times to 1.5 times GDP to the extent that there's a greater shift towards East Coast ports certainly at least in the near-term, we have the opportunity for growth that's above that. Tom Kim - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. That's really helpful. And I guess as we look a little bit further forward and supposedly the Panama Canal expansion should be completed first half next year, I would think that this should drive more business to the Gulf and to the East Coast, but I'm wondering what's your perspective around the puts and takes around the intermodal side of the business. Thanks. Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Did you say Gulf and the East Coast? Tom Kim - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah. The U.S. Gulf and the East Coast. Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. We've already seen a shift as many of these vessels are used in the Suez Canal to hit the East Coast. And the West Coast labor disruption shifted even more. So, the Panama Canal could certainly help. We don't think that that's going to be a threat to our international franchise. Tom Kim - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. That makes sense. Just to clarify then, so you're basically assuming that the share shift has effectively been done given that some of the big liners already moving capacities through the Suez? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. I would say much of it has been done. There is still some that's being implemented right now, which is why we're seeing pretty strong growth in our international franchise. Tom Kim - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. All right. That's very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I will turn the floor back to Mr. Jim Squires for closing remarks. James A. Squires - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: All right. Well, thank you, everyone. We appreciate your participation in today's call. And we look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect your lines at this time.",

Operator : Greetings and welcome to the Norfolk Southern Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Katie Cook, Director of Investor Relations for Norfolk Southern. Thank you. Ms. Cook, you may now begin. Katie U. Cook - Director- Investor Relations : Thank you, Rob, and good morning. Before we begin today's call, I would like to mention a few items. First, slides of the presenters are available on our website at norfolksouthern.com in the Investors section. Additionally, transcripts and downloads of today's call will be posted on our website. Please be advised that during this call, we may make certain forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially from those projected. Please refer to our Annual and Quarterly Reports filed with the SEC for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. Additionally, keep in mind that all references to reported results excluding certain adjustments, that is non-GAAP numbers, have been reconciled on our website in the Investors section. Now, it is my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern, Chairman, President and CEO, Jim Squires. James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Katie. Good morning, everyone and welcome to Norfolk Southern's third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. With me today are our Chief Marketing Officer, Alan Shaw; our Chief Operating Officer, Mark Manion; and our Chief Financial Officer, Marta Stewart. Earnings for the quarter were $1.49 per share, which was 17% lower than last year's record of $1.79 per share and included $0.08 per share of expenses related to restructuring initiatives. The results also reflect softness in the commodities markets, most significantly in coal, where our revenues were down 23% in the quarter. Alan, Mark and Marta will cover the various moving parts of the quarterly results momentarily, but before delving into that, let me highlight the progress we made on some longer-term initiatives during the third quarter. First, we began restructuring our Triple Crown Services subsidiary. With the restructuring, Triple Crown will focus on transporting automobile parts while NS will work with other supply chain partners to bring non-auto parts business into our conventional intermodal network. Second, our headquarters consolidation initiative is mostly complete with employees formerly in Roanoke, Virginia now working in Atlanta or Norfolk. This initiative allowed us to combine some functions while reducing management head count and G&A expenses from having three back office locations. It will give us a more cohesive and focused approach. For example, in sales and marketing where all managers not in the field are now co-located. Third, we completed the acquisition of the Delaware and Hudson Railway Company's line between Sunbury, Pennsylvania and Schenectady, New York from Canadian Pacific on September 18. This relatively small scale but highly complementary transaction gives us full operational control of an important network segment and greatly enhances our ability to serve markets in the Northeast. Implementation has gone very smoothly. These three long-term initiatives are in addition to our ongoing and continual efforts to improve service, asset utilization and returns. In that regard, I'm pleased to report that service improved in the third quarter and we are in good shape moving into the fall season this year with the onset of winter weather just a few months away. As you will hear from Mark, key resources like crews and locomotives are reasonably well-balanced with demand right now, while at the same time we are looking hard at underutilized assets in some parts of our network. Now without further ado, I'll turn the program over to Alan, Mark and Marta, and will return with some closing comments before taking your questions. Alan? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, Jim, and good morning to everyone. We appreciate you taking the time to join us today. There are four significant factors influencing our 2015 revenue. First, fuel surcharges are the primary driver of the revenue decline we have been discussing since the first quarter. The third quarter marks our largest expected quarterly drop in fuel surcharge revenue with a $255 million decrease. Second, low commodity prices and the strength of the U.S. dollar adversely impacted volumes of coal, steel, frac sand, crude oil and export traffic. We estimate that almost 50% of our revenue base is tied to commodity pricing or foreign exchange rates. Additionally, inventory builds have softened freight shipments since the second quarter. Despite these challenges, international intermodal, automotive and natural gas products all had large gains in the quarter. Third, increased truck capacity, low diesel prices and service levels reduced the pace of highway conversions in 2015. We expect truck capacity to tighten, which coupled with continued improvement in rail service and Norfolk Southern's network reach, will allow us to secure additional demand moving to rail. Fourth, we've employed solid pricing as demonstrated by gains in our revenue per unit excluding fuel overall and for all three primary business groups. We achieved these positive results despite negative mix associated with declines of several commodities previously referenced and increased international intermodal. Our continued focus on pricing has allowed us to improve total revenue per unit excluding fuel each quarter this year despite continued negative mix. During contract negotiations, we focus on both price and the fuel surcharge program for the best overall long-term result for Norfolk Southern recognizing that the average duration of our contracts is in excess of three years. We have emphasized market-based price increases and will continue with this focus reflective of the long-term benefit of rail transportation. The strength of our diverse network including our intermodal and automotive system, transfer terminals and alignment with our short-line partners and the customers they reach gives us the opportunity to continue to provide ripe opportunities for growth. Our service continues to improve and as it does, and as aggregate demand strengthens, thereby negatively impacting trucking availability, we anticipate a return to strong domestic intermodal conversion in tandem with pricing strategies that are sustainable. As our business mix changes, we continue our focus on the bottom line by evaluating our network for opportunities to increase earnings per share. A good example of these strategic structuring efforts is our recently completed acquisition of the D&H South Line, streamlining operations in the Northeast and offering a more service competitive product. Similarly, we recently announced the restructuring of our Triple Crown subsidiary which will reduce revenue beginning in the fourth quarter but is expected to be accretive to our bottom line next year and allows a more efficient use of capital. Turning to the third quarter results on slide three, our revenue declined $310 million primarily due to a combined $342 million decrease in coal and fuel surcharge revenue. Focusing on our coal franchise, revenue declined by 23% due to a decrease in fuel surcharge revenue followed by lower export and utility coal volumes. Utility reductions were driven by materially lower natural gas prices that impacted the dispatch position of coal plants on our network. This, combined with stockpiles above target levels, led to a 10% decline in our utility market to 22 million tons, above our previous guidance of 20 million tons per quarter. Export coal tonnage of 3.5 million tons was challenged by weak macroeconomic conditions, low benchmark prices and the strong U.S. dollar. While risk in this market exceeds that of utility, we continue to guide to 3 million tons per quarter through 2016. Our domestic intermodal volume declined 5% due to network service challenges, lower fuel prices and increased truck capacity. Domestic intermodal pricing remains strong and despite short-term truck capacity increases and softer truck spot pricing, we maintain a long-term projection of continued pricing gains and conversions to rail due to the value of the intermodal product as service improves. Driver availability, hours of service and electronic logging devices have positively influenced pricing, leading shippers to lock in capacity for next year. Our international intermodal volume grew by 9% due to growth at both East and West Coast ports as well as freight shifting from the West to East Coast ports, taking advantage of our network reach and alignment with shipping partners. Closing with our merchandise markets, the strong dollar and low commodity price environment negatively impacted steel, frac sand, crude oil and export grain. Conversely, strong consumer spending assisted with gains in automotive, ethanol, construction materials and plastics. Lastly, volumes of natural gas liquids improved due to increased fractionator activity on our network and domestic grain shipments grew due to regional crop opportunities. Moving into the fourth quarter, we anticipate volume declines in our commodity and export markets. Sequentially, most of these markets will remain flat compared to the third quarter, although steel has the potential for further decline and export coal will likely be closer to our guidance of 3 million tons. These continued declines in commodity prices and the Triple Crown restructuring will lower fourth-quarter volumes compared to last year with the year-over-year rate of decline expected to be similar to that of the third quarter. Next year, we will clear the negative comps in the utility franchise which was influenced by significantly higher natural gas prices and stockpile replenishments in 2014. We continue with our guidance of 20 million tons of utility coal per quarter. As stated earlier, the Triple Crown restructuring will allow Triple Crown to focus on its auto parts business with NS working with our shippers and channel partners to convert as much of their business as possible to the conventional intermodal network although the footprint of Triple Crown differs from our conventional network. As Triple Crown provides a door-to-door retail service, the restructure is expected to negatively impact intermodal revenue per unit although be modestly accretive to earnings next year. Reduced fuel surcharge revenue will continue to be a headwind in the fourth quarter although we will lap this comp after the first quarter of next year. Long-term, we will continue to focus on market-based pricing gains while better aligning our fuel programs with expenses. Despite the headwinds mentioned, our customers understand the value of rail transportation and as service continues to improve, we have the opportunity for market-based price increases and to grow our franchise. We expect growth opportunities in our consumer base markets that include intermodal and automotive as well as housing and construction-related commodities, ethanol and basic chemicals. We also expect the impact of inventory builds which will have a dampening effect in the fourth quarter will lessen by the first quarter of 2016. Norfolk Southern sits at both ends of the economic spectrum, production and consumption. This diversity has helped us during economic downturns and is a continuing strength of our franchise. Today, we are seeing growth particularly in automotive and the international side of intermodal. The strong dollar is a challenge as is macroeconomic weakness overseas which contributes to lower aggregate demand. Regardless, we are well positioned in multiple strategic markets for growth. As we move forward through the fourth quarter and into 2016, we will continue to partner with our customers to pursue strategic solutions that capitalize on market opportunities that create efficiencies and improve network productivity, while generating growth beneficial to the bottom line. Thank you for your attention and I will now turn the presentation over to Mark. Mark D. Manion - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. This morning I will update everyone on our operation which continues to trend positively. Specifically, we've seen year-over-year as well as sequential improvements in our service composite, speed and terminal dwell. While we still have work to do, we are encouraged by these results. But first, let's take a look at our safety. Our reportable injury ratio was 1.05 for the first nine months of 2015 as compared to 1.19 for the same period last year. The train incidents for the first three quarters of this year were 143 versus 154 over the same period last year. Grade crossing accidents through September 2015 were 255, down from 286 over the same period in 2014. Turning to our service composite performance, we see services returning at a steady pace. We are optimistic we will continue to experience improvement as our resources are largely in place. With regard to manpower, we have a sufficient crew base. In the third quarter, we added about 200 T&E employees. We have modulated our hiring based on volume and we now expect our T&E count in the fourth quarter to be flat with the third quarter. With regard to locomotives, we have a sufficient number of locomotives to handle our business and furthermore, our locomotive availability continues to improve due to improved velocity. Lastly, our operating plan in connection with our new yard expansion in Bellevue, Ohio is fully implemented and is benefiting us across the system. Turning to the next slide, we see train speed and terminal dwell are improving as well. Our speed for the quarter improved 3% year-over-year and our dwell has improved 6%. These system improvements are important, and it's also important to note we have seen solid improvement on our Chicago to Harrisburg line. This line handles the highest volumes on our system with a heavy concentration of intermodal. Our third quarter premium intermodal speed for this route is nearly what it was in 2013, and recently that speed has actually exceeded 2013 levels. In addition to the efficiencies we're seeing with our improving operation, we're continuing to make strategic reductions associated with our decrease in coal volumes. We have made manpower reductions at our Lamberts Point Coal Pier as well as in the Central Appalachian and Northern Appalachian region which encompass all of operations not just transportation. Furthermore, we continue to make changes to some of our coal routes with the most recent affected lines highlighted on this map. We have also reduced capital spending on branch lines where we've seen lower coal mine production. These contractions to our employee counts and infrastructure have been a result of our continual efforts to match our level of investment to a changing marketplace. With that, I will now turn it over to you, Marta. Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Slide 2 summarizes our operating results for the third quarter. As Alan has already discussed, the 10% decrease in revenues was largely related to lower fuel surcharge and to lower coal volume. Operating expenses in total declined by $134 million or 7%. Expenses benefited from significantly lower fuel prices but were unfavorably impacted by restructuring costs. The net result was an 18% reduction in income from railway operations and a 69.7 operating ratio for the quarter. The next slide shows the major components of the $134 million or 7% decrease in expenses. As I just mentioned, fuel was the primary driver of the overall reduction, and favorability in the compensation and benefits category also contributed to the decline. Before we get into the detail of the operating expenses, let's take a look at the effect of the restructuring costs on slide 4. The first column shows the Triple Crown related charges. As Alan described, our Triple Crown Services subsidiary will, beginning in mid-November, be refocused exclusively on its auto parts business. Therefore, the bulk of the road rail equipment used by Triple Crown will be surplus at that time. The $26 million shown as accelerated depreciation is the third-quarter charge for Triple Crown equipment. Turning to the Roanoke closure costs, they totaled $10 million in the quarter and consisted primarily of moving and office space expenses, which are reflected in the materials and other and in the purchased services line item. These costs added $37 million to the quarter and impacted the bottom line by $23 million or $0.08 per share. Going forward, we expect these two items to total $45 million in the fourth quarter with Triple Crown restructuring costs of $36 million and Roanoke office closure costs of approximately $9 million. Now let's take a look at the major expense line items. As shown on slide five, fuel expense decreased by $166 million or 43%, the majority of which was driven by lower fuel prices. Slide 6 details the $26 million or 4% decrease in compensation costs. Bonus and stock-based compensation expenses were lower by $51 million resulting from the decline in financial results. We expect fourth-quarter incentive compensation will be about $20 million lower than last year. Pay rate and payroll tax increases, as we discussed in the second quarter earnings call, began to moderate after July 1 and they were up $17 million and $9 million respectively. And lastly, we continue to run with a somewhat higher level of training and that expense was up $6 million. Next, materials and other cost decreased $3 million or 1%. Material usage, primarily associated with locomotive and freight cars, declined by $10 million. We also had lower derailment expenses. However, these items were partially offset by the aforementioned restructuring costs. As shown on slide 8, depreciation expense increased by $39 million or 17% due largely to the effect of accelerated depreciation of Triple Crown assets and also as a result of our larger capital base. As Jim mentioned, we completed the acquisition of the D&H line during the quarter and this increased our capital base by $215 million. Turning to slide 9, purchased services and rents were up $22 million or 5%, reflecting higher costs associated with equipment rent, engineering expenses and the Roanoke closure. As noted by Mark, velocity and terminal dwell have continued to improve, and we expect these expenses decline sequentially in the fourth quarter. Other income reflected on slide 10 rose by $7 million or 22% aided by $19 million in higher gains from sales of property offset in part by decreased returns from corporate-owned life insurance and lower coal royalty. Slide 11 depicts our income tax accruals and effective rate. The 37.6% third quarter rate is in line with our full-year guidance of 37.5%. Wrapping up our financial overview on slide 12, net income decreased by $107 million or 19%, and earnings per share was down $0.30 or 17% inclusive of the $0.08 of restructuring cost. Thank you and I'll now turn the program back to Jim. James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Marta. As you've heard this morning, further softening in the commodities markets weighed on our third-quarter results and it has tempered our fourth-quarter outlook as well. We now expect fourth quarter volumes will decline versus last year at a rate similar to our third quarter results. This year obviously has been a challenging one. We didn't deliver the kind of improvements you and we expect. But looking to 2016, we are confident that with a reasonably stable economy and our own intense focus on service, returns and growth, we are poised for better results. Thank you for your attention, and we are now happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. Thank you. Our first question is from Tom Kim with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question. Tom Kim - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good morning and thanks for your time here. Obviously this is an encouraging set of results and we're certainly pleased to see the improvements on the cost side. I wanted to ask just a first-off question with regard to some of your cautious comments around the nearer-term demand outlook. How do we reconcile that with some of the increased training costs and your head count expectations nearer-term? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Tom, let me answer that first. Obviously we have some short-term headwinds in terms of the trend in commodities and business conditions generally, offset by continuing strength in some of our consumer markets. But our strategy is designed to carry us through economic cycles because it focuses on fundamentals. First, service; excellent service will allow us to increase prices and reduce cost. And second, return on capital because we are a very capital intensive business and every dollar that we spend must have revenue and profit generation potential. And third, growth. We do want to grow our topline and see opportunities to do so even in a so-so economy. We'll do that first through price increases; second through volume growth, utilizing existing assets; and third and only as necessary, growth through capacity additions. So that in a nutshell is our strategy. We think that will carry us through changing business conditions. Now let's talk about the short-term resource picture. As I mentioned, we view key resources, crews and locomotives as essentially in balance with demand as we see it today. With that said, we are going to be nimble with resources and if business conditions change so will our resource strategy. Now, Marta, why don't you talk a little bit about the specifics around head count trends and other efficiency-related spending? Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : All right, sure. So Tom, we had earlier guided that we thought we would increase head count about 1,000 for the full year. But as Mark said, we're now up about 800 from the fourth quarter of last year to the third quarter of this year. As Mark said, we now do not think we're going to add that additional 200 for the end of the year so we think we're going to stay flat through this year. And looking into 2016 as Jim just described, we think that's the right level for the company. Tom Kim - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And just on that point if I could ask maybe a bit of a longer-term question. As we've looked through your head count and overall productivity, we've seen volumes effectively peak around 2006 and volumes even against last year's levels are still below that prior peak. But your overall head count levels are still at the 2006 levels. And I guess I'm wondering is there something structurally that's changed in your book of business that requires more head count per carload or does this present perhaps an opportunity to improve productivity? And you kind of alluded to the fact that as velocity increases, you potentially have room to be actually driving productivity further. So if you could just maybe elaborate a little bit more about the longer-term outlook for us because as we think about your OR, we certainly think and hope that there is opportunity to continue to drive that down. But one of the areas I've been looking at is just on the labor productivity side and it looks like you have room there to improve. And I just wanted to get your perspective on how do I think about the longer-term opportunity there, carload to employee head count? Thank you. James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Great line of questioning and we are absolutely focused on productivity and as the network velocity continues to increase, we will have opportunities to reduce head count relative to the volume trend. Now, Mark, why don't you comment on that? Mark D. Manion - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, I'd be glad to and we actually started modulating our hiring on the T&E side particularly back last summer. So we've been hiring more to attrition levels ever since mid-summer and anticipate that will continue to go on, again, based on \u2013 dependent on the business volumes. But as our velocity continues to increase, there are just great things that happen with that. And aside from the customer service side which is favorably impacted as well, but those velocity increases really help us on the cost side and it helps us reduce our employment, it helps us reduce our overall asset base. We will have the advantage of picking up more locomotives as a result of that. Our expenses decrease as our asset turns increase. And another thing that we see is re-crews go down and in fact they have been going down. Even third quarter, they were down \u2013 re-crews were down 6% and we'll continue to see that trend. Our overtime was down on the T&E side, not overall, but I think we'll continue to see favorable trend on the overtime piece as well. So we'll see that in fourth quarter. We will continue to see that going into next quarter and even things like our engineering department. As our fluidity improves, as our velocity improves, we can be more scheduled with our engineering department. They get more track time. They get out on the track when they need to be. They don't accumulate the overtime they otherwise would. So in short, improved velocity just drives a lot of good things when it comes to cost reduction. Tom Kim - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I appreciate that detail. Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your questions. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. First, I was wondering if you could talk about the decline in domestic intermodal and particularly relative to your main competitor which saw a 15% increase in the business. So, what I was wondering is if you could quantify or help to frame any potential share losses there and whether you expect to fully recapture those volumes and over what period of time? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Alan, why don't you take Allison's question on that? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Okay. Allison, the story for our domestic intermodal franchise is one that I highlighted earlier. It's been fuel, it's been truck capacity and it's been a service product that is not conducive to shifts to rail. That's going to get fixed and we're already seeing improvements in our velocity in our intermodal and we're starting to see an uptick in our intermodal volumes. And on the domestic side, certainly on the international side, we've seen great strength this year with more volume through the East Coast and our alliance with our shipping partners who are adding more capacity from the Far East to the East Coast and we expect the same next year. So we feel very good about our intermodal franchise going forward both domestically and internationally. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. And my follow-up question on coal, thinking about the RPU on an ex-fuel basis being up slightly year-over-year, could you talk about some of the dynamics there that pushed that to the positive side of the ledger? Was it mix, was it the lapping of rate cuts on the export side or a shift to fixed/variable contracts? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure Allison. Actually we've experienced negative mix within our coal franchise as we had a 37% decline in export, which as you know tends to be longer haul which is effectively a proxy for RPU. So despite that we've gotten increases and it's \u2013 increases in our RPU. Although very slight, it is a positive and we're going to hold onto that. But it's a function of our long-term pricing strategy in the coal markets and we feel very good next year because we're not going to have that negative comp in coal with respect to the utility franchise that we did this year. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of John Barnes with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your questions. John Barnes - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey. A follow-up question on the domestic intermodal side. In terms of the service that you're providing and I think I'm hearing you say that you're not in a position yet where you're offering a truck-like product. Is that harming you more on the length of haul? I mean, are you still very competitive on the longer stuff but it's putting pressure on the shorter length of haul where at higher diesel fuel rates you were becoming more competitive? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : John, let me comment on our domestic intermodal strategy briefly and then I'll let Alan address the specifics of your question. We certainly do want to grow our domestic intermodal business and we have a service product that allows us to do that today. Can we be even better and attract even more freight from the highway? Absolutely and that's our goal. Now with that said, our growth strategy in domestic intermodal is a combination of volume growth and pricing. Pricing is absolutely critical in that franchise as it is elsewhere. And so our strategy is to grow that business as with our other businesses through price increases, through volume growth using existing assets to the maximum extent possible and last, through increases in capacity but only where necessary. Alan, what about the specifics of John's question? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : John, to your question with respect to if there's a difference between length of haul and our ability to retain business or grow business through fuel, we have not seen that. John Barnes - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay, all right, no worries. And in terms of network realignment, I guess just from the standpoint of you own more of your \u2013 I'm thinking more on the coal export side, you own more of your assets there, whether it's the coal loading facilities and things like that. If we are now looking at a more permanently impaired export market, how aggressive can you be on realigning the cost around the export side of the business? And are there assets to shed, things along those lines that maybe better align those resources with the current volumes and then maybe even a little bit longer outlook which again looks to be maybe a bit more impaired? Thank you. James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : I'll get Mark to comment on some of the specific moves we've made in our coal franchise following up on his commentary. But let me just say we have fixed assets in our coal network as we do throughout our company and we are looking hard at which of those is underutilized and we will continue to do so. We have substantial fixed assets devoted to our coal franchise in the form of tracks and freight cars. One thing we can do and have done already is to begin working down the size of our coal car fleet and we can redeploy locomotives. So that's a fungible asset. This is a notoriously volatile market. We don't believe that we've seen the best days of export coal. We think that the commodity cycle eventually will turn and those assets will be fully deployed again. Mark, talk a little bit more about what we're doing in the coal fields. Mark D. Manion - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes, more current day, we are actually \u2013 we've furloughed or are in the process of furloughing about 150 people and that is across all the departments and operations including transportation, mechanical, engineering. We have, as I mentioned in the remarks, we've got lines that we have more recently either taken out of service or have pulled back on the investment for those lines. We continue to scrub Central App as well as other areas in our coal franchise. But let's also keep in mind that we've got areas in our coal business where we've had some nice activity going on and continue to have promise for the Illinois Basin coal. So it's a bit of a mixed bag but we will continue to scrub that Central App in order to ensure that we are reducing our cost commensurate with the level of activity out there. John Barnes - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks for your time. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead with your question. Jason H. Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC: Thank you. I wanted to focus a little bit on intermodal. Clearly, you've admitted you needed to get the service levels back up but it seems like that's happening. So that should be a good thing for freight as we head into 2016. However, longer-term, how do you think about investments in that network profitability of that division as it takes over a larger percentage of the business hauled? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : It's good business, it's a growth opportunity and it has been the volume growth engine of the company for years and that's likely to continue given secular trends in trucking. With that said, we're going to be very judicious with our investments and make sure that they are revenue and profit maximizing which is one of the foundations of our strategy. That applies to the domestic intermodal business as it does to all other businesses we operate. We should talk a little bit about international intermodal. That's a real bright spot right now. So Alan, why don't you expand on that a little bit? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : So as we discussed, it's grown in the upper mid-single digits for the year. We anticipate a continued growth along that level in the near-term future as more volume matriculates over to the East Coast from the West Coast and folks with whom we've aligned are adding capacity into the East Coast and it allows us to build a lot of revenue density in our trains and so it makes for very efficient movement. And so it's \u2013 we're excited about that and the growth opportunities and the returns that that provides. Jason H. Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC: Is there any way to quantify how much of that freight that moved over to the East Coast is sticky and how much either went back or will go back after this year? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes, some of it has definitely gone back. There is absolutely no doubt about that but still East Coast volumes are up. And as the Panama Canal widens, we're going to see even more larger ships hitting the East Coast which are going to need to make multiple ports of call to discharge their cargoes. And so that's going to have a benefit for the ports that we serve all up and down the East Coast. Jason H. Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC: Are we going to see more on dock rail at some of the ports do you think as that business comes in? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : At least one of the ports has announced that, an infrastructure plan for that. Jason H. Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay. Gentlemen, thank you for your time. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your questions. Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah. Good morning. I wanted to see if \u2013 Mark, I think in the past you have talked about productivity targets and I know with big change in volumes that it's an operating leverage effect. But what do you think the kind of productivity number is that you might achieve this year and how would you frame that opportunity for next year in terms of how you would define productivity? I think in the past you've said something around $100 million. So, I wonder if you could offer some thoughts on that topic? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : I'll take that one, Tom. We absolutely have productivity opportunities as we've been through this morning and as the network picks up speed, we will start to throw off a lot of productivity. And we're also working on a number of business process initiatives and capital utilization initiatives that should lead to productivity benefits. All of that should add up to a sizable offset to volumetric and inflationary pressure on our expenses particularly next year when operations are really humming. Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Let's see, and then, in terms of coal, how do we think about the \u2013 I think you commented, Alan, that coal stockpiles are above target. I don't know if you could comment on maybe how far above target and whether that's a source of risk to your 20 million tons per quarter view that it's possible a couple quarters you run below that to get the stockpiles down and then you get back to that 20 million tons a quarter. But just some thoughts on coal related to stockpiles. Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, that's a good question, Tom. We've actually seen stockpiles decrease in this quarter even though we exceeded our guidance by about 10%. So while stockpiles do have an impact, it so far has not negatively impacted our ability to hit our targets. Right now, Tom, we're estimating that stockpiles are about 15 days above target. I would say about five days in the South and about 25 days in the North. Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thanks for the time. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Rob Salmon with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your questions. Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, thanks. Another one here on coal. It looks like the tons per car increased significantly in the third quarter up to about 112. Can you give us a sense what's driving that? Has this been the result of changes in the network or is this merely business mix because we haven't been at this level for a long time. Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : We are always focused on tons per car because we \u2013 in the coal network, we are paid by tons. And so any time you can improve the revenue density on a coal train, it's very beneficial for us. One of the factors that impacted the improvement in tons per car immediately in the third quarter was a continued decline in export volume. Metallurgical volume to the ports typically has a lower tons per car than utility volume. Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. I guess we should be thinking about something around these levels looking forward given some of the challenges that are impacting the export book of business? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : To the extent that mix stays the same, yes. To the extent that we're continuing to work with our producers to get the optimum load level on the number of cars per train, then we'll improve the profitability of the individual trains. Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks, that's really helpful. I guess turning it over back to intermodal as well as the pricing, we've been hearing a lot about truck capacity having loosened up which has negatively impacted the overall spot market from a pricing perspective. Obviously with Norfolk, we are seeing better service across the network with the velocity having ticked up here as well as the service composite improved, but how confident are you that we can see kind of further improvement in pricing or just maintaining the level of pricing looking out to next year given a tough volume environment outside of the coal franchise as well as some weaker truck pricing that we're seeing in the marketplace? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Can you clarify? Are you asking about pricing in intermodal or overall? Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Just overall pricing just given what we're seeing in the trucking marketplace with capacity having loosened up, somewhat offset by service improvement. How are you guys thinking about the ability to maintain current pricing or potentially improve it as we look forward? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : We feel good about it and we feel good about what we've accomplished so far, recognizing we have room to grow. Our RPU ex-fuel has grown each quarter of this year, and our customers are taking a long-term view of this and they are recognizing the long-term value of rail transportation, and frankly, when service is back to where we want it to be, and we're making great strides to get there, then intermodal is a very easy sell even with a tightening between the truck market and intermodal pricing. And lastly, I'll add that we're taking a long-term view of this. And as Jim talked about, we're going to grow via price and we're going to grow via utilizing existing capacity. And any additional investment that would require is going to have to generate an acceptable level of return. James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Service led price increases are a key component of our strategy, and that applies to our domestic intermodal segment as well as all other segments of our business. Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Rob, as you know, spot pricing has gone down in the trucking industry but contract pricing is still up year-over-year. Now it's moderated but it's still up because shippers are concerned about long-term truck capacity. So that certainly plays into the thesis for the value of rail transportation. Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Appreciate the thoughts. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Matt Troy with Nomura Securities. Please proceed with your questions. Matt Troy - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks and good morning, everybody. I just wanted to ask about coal, specifically related to your 20 million ton per quarter run rate going forward guidance. It would imply something flattish with what you saw in 2015, a little bit more optimistic than the other railroads. Just wondering if you could help us maybe from a bottoms-up perspective how you get there, how much of that might be under contract, because I am contrasting it with some pretty dire commentary from CONSOL and Peabody and other coal companies yesterday and earlier in the week about the outlook for domestic coal. So I'm just wondering, be it mix shift, be it certain contracts you've secured, how you're confident that the coal volumes at 20 million tons per quarter will be flattish in 2016. Some help there would be great. Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Okay. So we've \u2013 if you think about the current natural gas environment, most of the conversions from coal to gas have already occurred \u2013 would have already occurred. So natural gas I know right now is close to $2 per million BTU, but the futures curve for next year is about $2.65 on average, which is pretty similar to where we were in 2012. So we can model our volumes at the plants and the units that we serve versus 2012. We also know that most of the near-term environmental headwinds associated with MATS, we've already been impacted by that and so that's not going to be a headwind going forward. Now longer term, the clean coal plant will potentially have an impact, and we are working with our customers to try to completely understand that and run scenarios within our own planning horizon. But through 2016, based on our conversations with our customers and modeling how their plants performed in 2012, we feel good about our volumes of 20 million tons per quarter. Matt Troy - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Understood. I guess my follow-up would be just if you could provide \u2013 Triple Crown has had an interesting evolution under the Norfolk umbrella. If you could just refresh us in terms of the rationale for the restructuring, the focus on auto parts and your commentary was interesting on how it would be mildly accretive next year. Can you just help us get from where the thought process was on Triple Crown say a year or two ago to why this restructuring makes sense and tactically what's going to drive that accretion or efficiency or productivity relative to those assets? Thanks. James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : The strategy involves focusing Triple Crown on what Triple Crown does best, and that's transport auto parts and re-channeling with other supply chain partners non-auto parts business into the conventional intermodal network where those customers and that volume can enjoy maximum efficiencies. Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Matt, you'll recall Triple Crown was originally an auto parts network. Matt Troy - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Right. So this is just after a little bit of scope creep, it's just doubling down on the core competency of the business... Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : It's going to improve our capital utilization by re-channeling as much of the other business, the freight all kinds, into our existing intermodal network where we already have the capacity. Matt Troy - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Understood. Thank you for the time. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please go ahead with your questions. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hey, thanks. Good morning. Wanted to \u2013 I think in the past you have recently talked about potentially volume increases in 2016. I guess I just wanted to get a sense in light of what your view is on the fourth quarter and some of the challenges shorter-term in the business, how should we think about that? Is your thinking changing at all? Obviously you've given us the view on coal. I just want to get a sense the rest of the business how you think about it for 2016 as the setup is right now? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Absolutely. We still feel very good about 2016. Our volumes year-to-date are down 1.2% in an environment where we've had 20% declines in our utility coal franchise, 35% declines in our export coal franchise and we haven't been able to attract highway conversions to our intermodal network. We're going to clear all of that next year. There is some underlying growth in international intermodal. We've talked about the automotive franchise is doing very well for us. Consumer goods are doing well. So once we clear some of these very visible comps or headwinds into next year, then you are going to see, we are all going to see the benefits of the underlying growth in some of these other markets. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay, that's helpful. As a follow-up, just switching to the pricing side, you mentioned earlier the focus on fuel surcharge adjustments and having to work through the book of business as it comes up for renewal. If you could just give us an update on how that process has been playing out, receptivity of customers, which I'm guessing is never great to a rate increase and potentially a surcharge in there. But I want to get a sense what are the puts and takes and do you have to give it all in pricing in order to get the fuel surcharge and how you prioritize those? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Chris, you bring up a great point. We prioritize price first and we always will. So we are not going to give up on price just to shift to another fuel surcharge program. Over time we're going to be working with our customers to align our fuel surcharge program more closely with expenses and also importantly take the volatility out of it. It's a lot more difficult to do in this environment where the WTI-based fuel surcharge, which is on about 50% of our business, is out of the money. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. And the progress to that, it's sort of a multi-year effort is my guess? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Correct, and it would certainly be benefited as oil prices increase. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): All right. Fair enough. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it. Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Yep. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your questions. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey, thanks. Morning, guys. James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Morning, Scott. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Just first thing real quick, Marta or Alan, did you guys give like a composite mix number on the quarter? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Scott, are you referring to the trend in mix in overall RPU? Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Yes. James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Or are \u2013 okay, so what is the change attributable to mix in total RPU? Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : It's a slight negative overall. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : Just a slight \u2013 and that's because the export coal went down a little bit, so slight negative. It's almost flat. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Thank you. In terms of coal again, there was a pretty nice sequential increase in coal yields. Can you help us explain that, Alan? I'm not sure if there's any liquidated damages in there or if that's mix and then just how to think about that going forward on a sequential basis, the coal yields? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : We \u2013 certainly we've had negative mix associated with export, so that has been an impact. We've had more utility South volume which tends to be a longer haul for us and so that has propped up the utility yield. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : And with your comments about stockpiles in the South being closer to target than the North, would you expect that mix to Southern utilities to continue? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : We feel good about our Southern utility franchise going forward. The North is sitting frankly right on the Marcellus natural gas play, so spot natural gas prices are very low, even below the Henry Hub published numbers. So the opportunity exists for a greater percentage of new South than new North going forward than we've had in the past. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And then just last thing, I want to go back to the head count question from earlier. So we have seen all the other rails implement some pretty meaningful head count reductions and your head count was up sequentially. I certainly understand your service metrics weren't and didn't improve as quickly as some of the others. But now that the service is improving, I guess I'm just not sure why you don't have an opportunity to take out a good amount of head count like we've seen all the other rails do as their services caught up. Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : Well, as Mark mentioned, we have a small opportunity \u2013 maybe the size you're talking about, a big opportunity, we had a small opportunity and we took it incrementally. In the fourth quarter, we think we are going to be flat. And really, Scott, what we're looking at in 2016 in terms of productivity is not so much because as we said we've guided towards level head count next year, so it's not so much the head count but it's the cost of those individuals. So he pointed to the fact that we have costs now such as re-crews and overtime, things like that, lack of track time because of the system velocity. So it's the price per hour if you will that we think is where we're going to get the most productivity next year. As we've said a couple of times, we believe absent a significant decline in volume which we do not foresee now, that we think that the head count level where we're at now in the third quarter is a good run rate for 2016. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : And, Marta, you think that you can see savings on a per employee basis even with higher incentive comp next year? Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : Yeah. Well, higher incentive comp, I'm looking at separately. So this year's incentive comp is down. Assuming financial results are better next year, that will be up. So absent the things that are stand-alone like incentive comp and pension and post-retirement, that sort of thing, the actual cash cost to the employees per person we think will go down next year. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. All right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Alex Vecchio with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions. Alexander Vecchio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, there. Thanks for the time. I hate to beat a dead horse but just back to the resource topic, specifically for the fourth quarter you guys are expecting total volumes to be down about 3%, in line with the third quarter which would imply sequentially about down 4% yet you are not expecting to reduce the head count. Can you just speak a little bit more specifically to the fourth quarter itself and why the carloads are going to come down but the head count you don't expect to? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Listen, we're going to be nimble with our resource strategy and I said that earlier. And if we see volumes deteriorate beyond where we think they are headed, then we certainly will begin addressing the labor side of the resource equation. But we're also focused on maintaining and improving service and that requires a certain level of employment. Moreover, we think that we came into this a little bit leaner than others and therefore we have a little bit less to shift. Alexander Vecchio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Alex, I'll also add that there is always a sequential fourth quarter decline in volume associated with holidays. So while that doesn't impact the year-over-year comps, you are preparing a sequential and so that does have an impact. Alexander Vecchio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, that's helpful. And, Jim, back to the service levels, I think a few quarters ago you were talking about expecting them to get back to \"normal\" by the end of the year and they certainly have shown improvement recently here. But it looks a little bit still a ways away from the 2012, 2013 levels in terms of the metrics we see on the train speed and dwell. Can you maybe talk to \u2013 do you still expect the service to get to the normalized levels by the end of this year or maybe it might take a little bit longer into next year at this point? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : You're right. We haven't made the kind of progress we said we would make on service as measured by network velocity and dwell, the metrics you see or internally. But we have made substantial progress and we are in a lot better condition now than we were a year ago. Using our internal metrics, our composite metric is more than 10 percentage points above where it was last year at this time and trending well versus a downward trend last year. So we feel very good about where we are in terms of our service and our intermodal premium trains are running extremely well. The network is in overall much better shape. We still have a ways to go and we will continue to push on that composite metric and get velocity up too. So that's our strategy. It's taking a little bit longer for us to get there than we had thought but we are well on our way. Alexander Vecchio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That makes sense. And just lastly a housekeeping question here for Marta. I think you had mentioned earlier in the call you expected purchased services and rent expense to be down sequentially in the fourth quarter. I was wondering maybe if you could maybe give us a little bit more quantification of how much you expect that bucket to be down sequentially? Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : Well, we don't give guidance on specific dollar amounts but what I will say is we had a little \u2013 two things mentioned there is we had some service related costs in purchased services because we didn't quite get the velocity we had hoped for the quarter. So we had that in purchased services and in equipment rent to the tune probably of about $6 million, $5 million or $6 million in addition to the service related costs we had in compensation and benefits. And the other item is after the November 15 or November 18 Triple Crown changeover, the Triple Crown dray costs are in that line item. So they will, as the business transitions over to intermodal, the dray part costs will be in purchased services. Alexander Vecchio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, that's helpful. Thank you for the time. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please go ahead with your questions. Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Good morning. I know it's been a long call. Jim, congrats on the Chairmanship and Mark, good luck in your upcoming retirement. Just maybe some clarification on a couple of coal comments. Alan, you talked about clearing the deck. I just wanted to clarify to your answer before, do you have any more MATS or CSAPR closings that are mandated in 2016? And then is the 3 million tons run rate what you are looking for on the export side? Is that \u2013 I know you kept mentioning the 20 million tons on the domestic. Are you looking at the 3 million tons to hold through 2016 on the export side? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Ken, we've got about one or two plants, smaller plants that will be impacted by MATS so it's not going to have that much of material impact on what we're doing in our coal franchise next year. On the export side, yes, we are continuing to guide to 3 million tons a quarter, although I'll tell you that has more risk associated with it than utility guidance. And we're, as I know you are, we're watching the worldwide indices and the spot market for Queensland (1:02:23) coking coal is now down in the low $80s per metric ton. Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. So even with the prices which doesn't really make sense to ship, you are still \u2013 thoughts are that it kind of holds at these levels? Just are there contracts that lock that in? I just want to get some idea of what level of confidence you have in that or is that just an aggressive or conservative view? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : To which are you speaking? Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : To the 3 million ton outlook on the export side? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. I think that has downside risk to it. Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then, lastly, Jim, just stepping back and there have been a lot of questions on employee and head count and efficiency. Your last sentence there, you kind of noted that you came into this a bit leaner than others in the downturn. Maybe just get your thoughts internally on the operating ratio at 69.7, finally moving below 70 but now the industry has moved far ahead, your peers are now over 500 basis points better in the third quarter. You now have three carriers at or below 60. Do you step back and kind of think about maybe something needs to be overhauled or completely changed in the way you've been operating to adjust that operating ratio? Just as the peers are moving, it looks like farther away on that metric, just what do you think needs to be done? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Well, I think we're going to make a lot of progress on the operating ratio and we have the ability to lower the operating ratio significantly and we're confident that we can do that. Do I think we're going to post a 53 operating ratio next year? Probably not. Hats off to those who are at that point already. But with that said, we have a lot of progress that we can make on our operating ratio. We are keenly aware of where we stand in the peer comparisons and we are determined to improve our performance both in terms of a lower operating ratio and higher earnings. Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. So you don't step back as now in the Chairman/CEO role and say wow, we need to either gut programs or overhaul something? I mean I see the stuff on Triple Crown but there's nothing that you see as needs to be overhauled to really make fundamental changes to get that lower? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Nothing is off the table and we are having far-ranging strategic discussions inside the company right now. So we could certainly entertain different approaches to sizing our asset base relative to our revenue and income generation potential. That's a strategy that takes a while to deploy and deserves careful consideration because any strategy that starts hiving off significant portions of the asset base entails the risk of revenue loss. So we need to be very thoughtful about that but certainly we are open internally and talking about different ways to run this company and are determined as I said to reduce the operating ratio and grow our profits. Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Is there a certain level of OR if the industry approaches that you fear more regulatory insight or overhang? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Well, I think the \u2013 look, the industry's view and I think it's the right view, is we need to generate substantial profits and returns in order to justify reinvestment. We are a very capital intensive business. We have major reinvestment needs and the only way that's going to happen is if we generate adequate returns. So that's our focus. I think it's a compelling argument in the regulatory arena. Don't cap our returns otherwise you will see reinvestment decline and I don't think anybody wants that. Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Jim, Appreciate the time and insight. Thank you, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your questions. Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.: Thanks and good morning. I wanted to start maybe following up on that last question. I wanted to ask about CapEx. It sounds like there are several areas where you are improving capital efficiency. So with that in mind, how do you expect your CapEx to trend next year, is there an opportunity on an absolute dollar basis for CapEx to be down in 2016? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Absolutely. Now bear in mind that CapEx in 2015 includes the D&H acquisition at or around $200 million. So barring a similar transaction next year, that would come off CapEx and we do believe we have room to bring CapEx down beyond even that component. So yes, look for somewhat lower capital spending next year from us. Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.: Any initial kind of order of magnitude that you are thinking about or is it still too early? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Well, I'll say this, it is early and we haven't completed our capital budget for 2016 yet. But in my view the kinds of capital spending that we've been putting up relative to revenue or cash flow is not something we want to continue to do and we do see a need to bring CapEx down relative to sales and relative to cash flow. And that's our plan starting next year. Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.: Okay, great. And maybe as my second one, I wanted to ask another one on pricing. So as we look into 2016, do you think the magnitude of core price increases will look similar to what you've experienced this year or with uncertainty in the industrial economy, do you see downside risk to the current pricing environment? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Price increases are a key component of our strategy. We absolutely intend to increase our pricing commensurate with the value of the product that we are offering in the marketplace. So there will be no letup in terms of our emphasis on price increases as a driver of revenue and profit growth. Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. I'll leave it at that. Thanks for the time. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions. Brandon Robert Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Well, good morning, everyone. I know it's been a very long call, so I'm just going to keep it to one. But, Jim, it's kind of along the lines of what Ken was just discussing with you here. I mean, I know you're talking about OR improvement but it just feels like maybe your franchise is a little bit more levered to higher commodity prices. I mean, previously you booked some profits in your fuel revenue which have obviously gone away. You've historically made a lot of money in the coal markets. I mean, coal has gone from 30% of your revenue now down to 17%. And I know you think that things are going to be stable but natural gas prices are even lower this year. So how do we just put all this together? I mean, if natural gas stays here, if we don't get a rebound in fuel prices, how do you aggressively attack the OR with some of those headwinds? And speaking to the CapEx side or even the asset side or restructuring, why not get more aggressive on restructuring the coal network? I mean, again, it is down significantly from where it was even three years or four years ago. James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Well, you're right. We're a commodities hauler. So, you heard Alan say 50% of our loads are commodities based and so it definitely is more challenging in this sort of commodities environment. But that doesn't mean we don't have any opportunities. We are going to continue to push on revenue growth as Alan went through. Fortunately, we have a pretty diversified franchise levered to commodities as it is. We still have other opportunities to grow. We're going to push on those. We're going to be very judicious with our spending. We're going to watch our capital very, very carefully and focus on again service improvements, return on capital and good growth. Brandon Robert Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your questions. Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, good morning and thanks for making some time here at the end. I know it's been a pretty long call. So my question is basically just on the coal network rationalization. If you can just give a little bit more context of \u2013 obviously it's been going on for 18 months or so. 300 miles have been taken out of service or restricted. Can you just give us a sense of how much of the network has been analyzed at this point? You mentioned the labor savings obviously taking some assets, but you're still abandoning them. So I'm assuming you're going to have to have some maintenance expense with that. So, if you can try to quantify that for us, that would be helpful and also how you approach that in general? Is this a proactive type of analysis where you get out ahead of volume cuts or you just take it as the mines start to slow down? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : It is a proactive approach. And I would characterize what we have done as a good start. There are maybe other opportunities as well. We are very actively analyzing all opportunities to rationalize our asset base, particularly in the coal network. And there may be other rationalization opportunities ahead. But by the same token, we do want to retain the ability to handle coal volume which we think we will garner in the future. So we're not throwing in the towel on our coal business. We are going to continue to be a coal hauler now and in the future, and we want to make sure we have the assets on hand to do that. Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And just a quick follow-up. Is there any sense you can give us in terms of how much the network has been looked at, at this point in time and any savings rule of thumb per mile taken out that you're able to realize? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : We've focused up to this point on the Central App network in particular, as Mark went through. The savings will be meaningful, and we'll see those both in terms of expense savings and capital avoidance. Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks for your time. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead with your questions. Ben J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Good morning. Real quick on the Triple Crown transition, can you give an update on the transition of the non-auto business? I know that we're coming up toward the November 15 service cut first. And then second, what was the logic in keeping the auto parts business intact? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Well, I'll take the last part of that because that goes to the strategic rationale for the transaction. I'll let Alan talk about what's happening in terms of the re-channeling. Triple Crown started out as an auto parts hauler and that is where they really excel. And the technology that we will continue to deploy in that service works really, really well in the lanes where they will continue to haul the auto parts. So that's their forte, and we made the decision to keep them going in that area while looking to rechannel the other freight. Alan? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : We are working with our channel partners. I'll reiterate what I said before because I don't want expectations to get too high, is that almost on purpose the Triple Crown network did not overlay the conventional network. So it doesn't necessarily operate in the same lanes. So it's going to be difficult to matriculate a bunch of the business over to our conventional network, but it's still accretive to earnings and it still represents an improvement in capital utilization. Ben J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Appreciate the time. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Buckingham Research. Please proceed with your questions. Mr. Kauffman your line is open for questions. Jeffrey Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Sorry about that. Hey, guys. Congratulations in a tough environment. Most of my questions have been answered, but let me come back to Marta on capital spend and free cash. I think it was you, Jim, that said you could see CapEx lower next year. You want to get back to a more normalized spend. Including D&H, kind of what are we looking at in terms of CapEx this year and how do you think about CapEx say over a two-year, three-year period longer-term? Where do you think it should be? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : I'd like to respond to your free cash flow point first, and I'll let Marta talk about the trend in capital spending. Our free cash flow has been somewhat subdued this year, and we're going to turn that around next year as well. The formula for that obviously involves higher net income, bonus depreciation if that occurs. It's the absence of the D&H transaction affecting capital expenditures and it's a somewhat lower non-D&H related CapEx. So all of that gives you much more robust free cash flow we believe next year. Jeffrey Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay, Marta? Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : Yes. Jeff, so with regard to our capital program, at the beginning of the year we announced a $2.4 billion capital program. When the volumes didn't come in exactly with what we had been forecasting, we lowered it by about 5% or $130 million. And then \u2013 and of course this year we have the $215 million that Jim described. So going forward you should think about levels more like the original $2.4 billion minus the $130 million, and as Jim said, we think the absolute number in 2016 will be lower than that normalized level this year. Jeffrey Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: All right. And just to follow up on that, you have increased the share buyback this year. With the stock down at these levels, is there a better use of free cash after capital spending than shares right now? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : We certainly have deployed both borrowing capacity, cash on hand, and free cash flow for share buybacks this year, and we see good value in our shares. We'll continue to use excess free cash flow over and above our dividend and available borrowing capacity for that purpose in the future. Jeffrey Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: All right. Well, congratulations, guys. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead with your questions. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning, guys. And thanks for making time here. Just kind of thinking broad brush here with the headwinds that might be with the Triple Crown business migrating off and obviously the export coal decline next year, would you expect volume overall to be positive or negative coming into 2016 off of 2015? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey, David, it's \u2013 we still have the potential for growth next year. I think it's going to be more targeted towards the second half of the year. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: So, more flattish, maybe up a little? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: In aggregate. And then, I guess, Marta, as a question for you, in terms of that lower rate of volume growth next year, do you think that lack of volume driven productivity may offset some of your ability to recover the efficiency-led costs or the inefficiency added costs of the last couple quarters and some of the things around Triple Crown? Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : Well, we'll definitely be pushing on efficiency next year. And Triple Crown is going to be one of the reasons how. As Alan said, those \u2013 the moves that move on the intermodal network should be more efficient than the shorter road rail trains we were running some of this year. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: I mean, it just seems like the operating income decline relative to the 3% decline in RTMs is pretty significant from a volume leverage standpoint, which would seem to indicate that if you've got a flatter volume year next year it may be tougher to get some of that leverage to fall through or some of those efficiency savings to fall through. Am I thinking about that right or is there \u2013 or do you think there is going to be a strong prospect for organic earnings growth in a flat volume year? Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : Well, one thing to remember for next year is this year thus far we've had, all three quarters so far this year we've had service-related expenses and some weather-related expenses in the first quarter, but they cumulatively total about $82 million. So, year-over-year, we don't expect those to recur in 2016. So that will begin our productivity improvements and we expect to increase on that. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Cleo Zagrean with Macquarie. Please go ahead with your questions. Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Good morning and thank you for your time. My first question relates to coal royalties. We've seen them contribute about $0.04 this quarter. When are they up for renewal and please remind us whether they relate mostly to domestic utility coal or other areas as well? Thank you. Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : It varies by contract with respect to the duration, but much of our coal royalties is associated with metallurgical coal. Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: I'm sorry? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Much of our coal royalties is associated with metallurgical coal. Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Metallurgical, okay. All right. And then my second question comes back to fuel surcharges versus coal price. You've commented on this call and recent other calls that your customers have been unwilling to give up fuel savings without a value exchange in terms of core price, and on your end you said you are unwilling to do that. So, is it best for us to model core price increases offset by some negative mix and then leave surcharges unchanged into 2017 as the forward curve suggests? Thank you. Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Model \u2013 can you say that point about \u2013 did you mention 2017? Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Yes, in the sense that on the current forward curves your surcharge programs are out of the money for some years out. And so, if right now that change is not occurring and you're saying you are needing fuel prices to go higher for that to happen, should we assume that there is no change on the fuel surcharge and just model core price increases? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Okay, I get your point. Yeah, it will be easier to accomplish this as or if WTI prices go up but it also gives us the opportunity to push price. Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. And your feedback from customers so far, can you tell us a little bit about that? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Which? Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: What your customers... Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Can you help me understand, Cleo...? Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Yes. It's about how discussions are going in terms of getting core price because in my understanding that conversation is still tough as you are trying to get core but they don't want to give up the fuel. So how is that all netting out? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : That's a good point. Negotiations with customers with respect to price are always tough but they do recognize the long-term value of rail transportation. There is a pause right now in demand in some commodity markets. Jim talked about how 50% of our revenues are tied to commodity or foreign exchange. That's a short-term pause. Inventory drawdowns we believe will be complete by the end of this year and shippers are trying to line up capacity for 2016 and 2017 which is why you see in the trucking market spot prices declining but contract prices still moving up although moderating. Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. And is it true that at this time of year you are already starting to discuss the book for intermodal for next year? How is that going given your improvement in service in terms of setting up prices for next year? Thank you very much for your time. Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : In terms of filling up what, Cleo? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : The book. Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : The book... Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: In terms of... Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Our intermodal contracts aren't necessarily at the end of the year so we always have a mix of contracts, whether it's commodity or customer base, that are up throughout the year. And so certainly we are discussing contracts for the remainder of this year and next year and we are pushing price and the long-term value of rail transportation. Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you. Appreciate your time. Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : And Cleo, if I could mention one more thing on the fuel surcharge revenue you asked about for modeling for next year, don't forget that in the first quarter of this year we still had a somewhat elevated level because the month of January benefited from the lag when oil prices were higher. So each quarter of this year you've seen declining absolute numbers of fuel surcharge revenue. We expect that to continue and have declining fuel surcharge revenue in the fourth quarter. So I just wanted to put that out there for when you're modeling 2016. Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you, Marta. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Jim Squires for closing comments. James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Well, thank you, everyone. We appreciate all your excellent questions and we will talk to you again next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",

(Broker) Operator : Greetings and welcome to the Norfolk Southern Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Katie Cook, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. Ms. Cook, you may now begin. Katie U. Cook - Director- Investor Relations : Thank you, Kristine, and good morning. Before we begin today's call, I would like to mention a few items. First, the slides of the presenters are available on our website at norfolksouthern.com in the Investors section. Additionally, transcripts and downloads of today's call will be posted on our website. Please be advised that during this call, we may make certain forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially from those projected. Please refer to our Annual and Quarterly Reports filed with the SEC for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. Additionally, keep in mind that all references to reported results excluding certain adjustments, that is non-GAAP numbers, have been reconciled on our website in the Investors section. Now, it is my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern, Chairman, President and CEO, Jim Squires. James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Norfolk Southern's fourth quarter of 2015 earnings conference call. With me today are our Chief Marketing Officer, Alan Shaw; our Senior Vice President Operations, Mike Wheeler; and our Chief Financial Officer, Marta Stewart. Mark Manion is also with us for his last analyst call after a very successful career. Mark has been instrumental in helping cultivate the best employees in the industry. He has also been at the forefront of promoting safety programs, as a critical component of a well run business. Mark, thank you for your devoted service. With Mike Wheeler's assumption of the Chief Operating Officer role on February 1, our senior leadership transition will be complete. Since last June, when I took the reins as CEO, my team and I have been single-mindedly focused on shareholder value. We have responded to a dynamic marketplace and changes in the economic landscape by driving change, while building on Norfolk Southern's strengths. In conjunction with our leadership transition, we have already completed many key initiatives, while simultaneously launching a new five-year plan, centered on disciplined cost control and profitability to produce sustainable returns for shareholders. I'm eager to share details regarding our team's plan, but first, I want to briefly address the fourth quarter and full year results. 2015 was marked by weak commodity markets and the strong dollar. That had an adverse impact on Norfolk Southern and the railroad industry as a whole. Norfolk Southern earnings for the fourth quarter were $1.20 per share, which was 27% lower than last year's $1.64 per share. Earnings for the full year were $5.10 per share, which was 20% lower than last year's record of $6.39. Alan, Mike and Marta will go into more detail on this shortly. It is against this challenging macroeconomic backdrop that our team has aggressively executed on a number of key initiatives to build a strong foundation for sustainable shareholder value creation. The core of our strategy is this, maintain a high level of service to promote operational efficiency and growth, while rightsizing resources to reflect the changing nature of our top line. Here are just a few of the things my team and I have already done to further this strategy. First, we return service to previous high levels, supporting cost control, asset utilization and growth. Second, we took action on G&A, closing and putting up for sale our office building in Roanoke, Virginia, while consolidating or relocating approximately 500 back-office jobs. We also streamlined senior management, eliminating three senior management positions. Third, we restructured an underperforming subsidiary, Triple Crown to sharpen our intermodal strategy and boost profit. Fourth, we completed the acquisition of the Delaware & Hudson South, giving us full operational control of an important network segment in the Northeast. The transaction has been well received by our customers. Fifth, we cut capital spending by $100 million last year to adapt to the shifting economic environment, and we are committed to reducing it further if necessary. And sixth, reacting to changes in our coal business, we completed an initial round of line rationalizations in the coal fields, the closure of a major coal terminal and the consolidation of two operating divisions in West Virginia and Virginia. Now let's turn next to the elements of our strategic plan beginning on slide five. This plan begun on June 1, 2015 when I became CEO and announced on December 4, is the result of a comprehensive evaluation of our business model, in particular our cost structure and top line growth potential. The plan is built on disciplined cost control and asset utilization. It is also designed to generate over time revenue growth through pricing and increased volume in service-sensitive markets where we have made significant investments and having well established market presence. The plan is dynamic allowing us to evolve as required given an ever-changing world. Overall, we expect to achieve annual productivity savings of more than $650 million by 2020, growing from an initial $130 million in 2016, by improving the consistency and reliability of our service and running a faster, more efficient railroad. Turning to our revenue plan on slide seven. Well, our expectations are modest for 2016. Revenue growth from pricing and volume increases is one component of our strategic plan. We have been deliberate in our analysis, developing a detailed bottom up roadmap to growth over the next five years. The plan is conservative and flexible in nature and gives us the ability to adjust to changes in the economy. Slide eight shows that over the five-year period, we expect revenue per unit to grow approximately 2.5% on a compound annual basis through 2020, supported by pricing levels exceeding CPI. Consistent with our past experience, volume will grow relatively in line with GDP as growth in intermodal and other consumer-oriented products offsets coal headwinds. Turning to slide nine, I will now detail our expert expectations for each major revenue group. We expect coal volume to decline in 2016 and then stabilize. Overall our core forecast is more conservative than estimates from the Department of Energy and other independent experts. We believe growth in our merchandise lines of business will attract the economy overall, increasing generally in line with GDP. And we are calling for intermodal volume to increase at a rate better than GDP, with compound annual growth of about 4.5%. This will be driven primarily by tighter truck capacity and improved domestic service levels. It will also reflect our close alignment with international steamship lines that are adding capacity in Norfolk Southern-served markets as they shift from West Coast to East Coast ports. Now turning to our expense reduction and cost control plan. As you see, on slide 11, our strategy is to provide industry leading service to drive the operating ratio lower. We are committed to achieving a sub-65% OR by 2020, but we won't stop there. Once we achieve this initial goal, we intend to take our operating ratio even lower by focusing relentlessly on four things : head count, locomotive productivity, fuel efficiency and our network footprint, all while supporting quality service for our customers. Moving to slide 12, the current backdrop of low commodity prices and a strong U.S. dollar has created significant headwinds that affected 2015 results across our industry. Our plan will help offset some of these headwinds, actively managing to market dynamics, both downside and upside, in a timely manner. Right now, given current market dynamics, we are aggressively bringing down over time, head count and our locomotive fleet size. We are also pushing on fuel efficiency, closing or scaling back operations in yards and terminals and rationalizing secondary lines. All of this is being done, so that we can achieve target levels of profitability while maintaining strong service, and the potential for future growth. Even given challenging future market conditions, we believe we can achieve a sub-65% operating ratio by 2020. We have the right team and the right plan to address the current headwinds and deliver superior value as we move through 2016 and beyond. With our improved service, we have achieved a faster railroad, specifically year-over-year we achieved a 17% improvement in train speed, and a 21% improvement in terminal dwell. These improvements across our network will lower costs while enhancing our service offering and the value of our product. A faster railroad is, simply put, a more profitable railroad. Turning to slide 14, our plan is designed to optimize resources and accelerate growth through a variety of disciplined expense control initiatives in compensation and benefits, purchase services and rents, materials and fuel. We expect to achieve annual expense savings over $650 million by 2020, growing from an initial $130 million in 2016. Starting with compensation and benefits, service improvements, traffic shifts, network rationalizations and cutbacks in yards and terminals will enable Norfolk Southern to reduce head count in 2016 and beyond, building on initiatives we began in 2015 to right size the network. We expect this to result in annual productivity savings of $420 million by 2020. Now to purchased services and rents. We are projecting annual savings of $70 million by 2020 through reduced equipment rental and lease costs, lower payments for third-party switching, leveraging the recent expansion of Moorman Yard in Bellevue, Ohio and lower trackage rights and haulage payments. As you can see on slide 15, we expect materials to deliver approximately $80 million in annual savings by 2020 through more productive locomotive maintenance programs and replacement of older, less reliable locomotives. And finally Norfolk Southern plans to cut fuel expenses by approximately $80 million per year by 2020 through rationalization of our locomotive fleet and full implementation of fuel management technology. In conclusion on slide 16, we believe we have the right strategic plan to streamline operations, accelerate pricing and growth, and enhance shareholder value. The plan leverages our core competency in providing fast efficient service, while improving network efficiency and consolidating operations. Importantly, through disciplined cost control, we believe we can achieve the expense reduction goals outlined in this plan and even more. To be clear, if market conditions worsen more than anticipated, our plan has flexibility built into it so that we can achieve additional cost savings. We are also committed to a capital allocation strategy that returns significant capital to shareholders. Over the past 10 years, Norfolk Southern distributed nearly $15 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends that increased steadily at a 17% compound annual rate. Our plan targets a dividend payout ratio of 33% over the longer term and share repurchases using free cash flow and borrowing capacity. I'll now turn the program over to Alan, Mike and Marta, who are just as committed as I am to successfully executing our plan. They will provide more details on our 2015 results and our 2016 outlook and I will then return with some closing comments before taking your questions. Alan? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, Jim. Good morning to everyone and thank you for joining us today. I would like to begin by expressing our commitment to the growth plan, Jim just reviewed. It is a multi-dimensional sustainable plan with a focus on a differentiated service product that the market values, driving pricing and volume growth while improving shareholder return. Moving to slide two. I'll provide some perspective on our 2015 top line performance. Annual revenue of $10.5 billion declined 10% compared to 2014, with fuel surcharges and coal accounting for the decrease. Fuel losses of $852 million were the result of decreased oil prices. This negative comp will sharply decline in the first quarter, as January 2015 was the last month West Texas Intermediate exceeded the average fuel surcharge trigger point. Overall, 2015 was a challenging year with low commodity prices and strong U.S. dollar conditions, which consistently deteriorated each quarter and largely continued unabated. Despite this environment, we did experience upside revenue growth in our merchandise and intermodal markets, excluding fuel. We also posted record revenue in our agriculture franchise and record volume in both chemicals and intermodal. On slide three, our fourth quarter results were impacted by decreased fuel surcharges, low commodity prices, unseasonably warm weather and high retail inventories. Volume declined in all three of our major business segments. Reduced fuel surcharges and co-revenue combined for 84% of our overall revenue decline. Despite these challenges, positive pricing offset the negative mix impact of several commodities, driving sequential growth in RPU less fuel for each of the last five quarters. Moving to coal. Warm weather and lower natural gas prices resulted in declines in utility coal shipments. Export coal met our 3 million ton guidance for the quarter, but continued to be challenged compared to prior year due to global oversupply and the strong U.S. dollar. Our first quarter target is 2.5 million to 3 million tons, with the added uncertainty in the market. Excluding fuel, RPU increased for coal due to positive pricing and increased longer haul utility volume in the South. Slide five depicts the record high temperatures in our service area that impacted utility coal shipments later in the quarter. In the second quarter and third quarters, our utility coal volumes met guidance and had settled into the low natural gas environment. Similar volume trends existed in October and November; however the warm weather significantly decreased December deliveries. Stockpiles are 40 days above target, which we anticipate will reduce first quarter volume to 15 million tons. The inventory overhang is projected to continue into the second quarter, once stockpiles return to target. We project utility volumes in the range of 17 million to 19 million tons per quarter, assuming normal weather patterns. As we turn to intermodal, we've restructured our Triple Crown franchise, effective November 2015, with business winding down earlier in the quarter, as customers implemented alternative plans before the effective date. This equates to 4% in volume decline and 6% in revenue decline for intermodal. While the Triple Crown restructure will have a negative impact on both volume and revenue in 2016, it will be accretive to our bottom line and improve capital utilization. Excluding Triple Crown, intermodal fell 1% for the quarter. This decline can largely be attributed to increased truck capacity and high retail inventory levels. As the quarter progressed and service was restored to previous high levels, we experienced volume gains in some key accounts. These improvements will have a positive impact on our domestic franchise moving forward. Lastly, pricing gains throughout the year increased revenue per unit by 4% when excluding Triple Crown and fuel. Consistent improvement in contract pricing creates confidence that this trend will continue and is supportive of our growth plan. Our merchandise markets were impacted by low commodity prices, a strong dollar and high inventory levels, reducing demand for metals, export grain, crude oil and lumber. On a positive note, automotive posted a 9% increase in the quarter exceeding North American vehicle production growth. We also experienced strong growth in natural gas products, as well as ethanol. Losses in higher rated commodities created a negative mix impact on RPU. However, strong pricing led to RPU less fuel growth of 2%. NS volumes as reported to the AAR, declined by 6.7% in the fourth quarter in line with other Class I's. Eliminating the impact of the Triple Crown restructuring. NS volume declined 5% during this period. Concluding with our outlook, the impact of the warm weather on our coal franchise, on certain commodity prices and continued high retail inventory levels, create headwinds for volumes particularly in the first quarter. Coal volumes will be impacted as utilities work down high stockpiles. Commodity price declines and foreign exchange pressures will affect our merchandise franchise. Volumes in our intermodal franchise will be impacted by the Triple Crown restructuring. Although, improved service and reach will benefit our conventional intermodal and automotive networks, pricing increases accelerated throughout 2015, with the strongest pricing in the fourth quarter benefiting our top line through 2016. The impact of lower fuel surcharge will subside in early 2016, and we are actively converting to programs with less variability and greater alignment to expenses. Our longer term objectives include the continued diversification of our traffic base, a key to maintaining a strong franchise. Service-sensitive business is Norfolk Southern's fastest-growing segment is evidenced by our automotive and intermodal franchises, which grew at a 7% CAGR excluding Triple Crown over the last five years. We have the best-in-class network and with return to service levels, we expect volume growth in these markets, mitigating some risk associated with commodity-based products. Domestic intermodal will benefit from our service product and increased regulations in the trucking industry. International intermodal will grow as a result of our network reach and our alignment with shipping partners adding capacity on the East Coast. In conclusion, a balanced franchise, disciplined market base pricing and an improved service product allows our management team to aggressively respond to a changing economic environment. We are confident in our pricing and volume growth plan, developed in concert with operations for our customers and their specific service needs and the unique market opportunities presented by our network. Collectively we manage this flexible plan to adjust resources as volume levels fluctuate to drive targeted financial results. Next, Mike will describe our improved service levels, which increase the value of our product and generate volume growth. Michael Joseph Wheeler - Senior Vice President-Operations: (24:16-24:25) substantial improvement (24:25-24:29) in 2015. Today we are taking the next step in strengthening our company from an operational and financial perspective. Let me begin with one of our core principles on slide two, which is involved in all of our decisions, safety. We achieved a 14% decline in reportable injuries and even more importantly, a 19% reduction in serious injuries over 2014. We're proud of our position as an industry leader in safety and our commitment to safety will not waiver. Turning to service on slide three, another of our core principles. As laid out here, our composite service performance continued to improve throughout the fourth quarter. Importantly, the performance of this comprehensive metric remained strong into the first quarter of 2016, positive change is underway. Our goal is to maintain this level of service, which we believe provides the optimal balance between delivering a high service product to our customers, while running a low cost operation. We are confident we can continue to provide this level of service, as we implement our strategic plan to run more efficient and more profitable railroad. On a recent service note, NS achieved our most successful peak season ever for our premium accounts with respect on-time performance and total volume handled. Looking to slide four, we continue to deliver significant improvement in our train speed and terminal dwell metrics, which are leading to improvements in our locomotive availability and efficiency of our car utilization. Specifically, year-over-year for the quarter, we achieved a 17% improvement in train speed and a 21% improvement in terminal dwell. As we've said before a faster railroad is a less expensive and more profitable railroad. These improvements will translate directly into cost reductions, increased revenue and improved margins. And as a result, increase value for our stakeholders, including better service for our customers. (27:11-27:17) increased our focus on using our existing resources for the (27:19-27:23) near our historic high service levels, we will continue to right size our resources, implement (27:31-27:58) productivity savings from our better service and efficiency initiatives in 2016. The five-year plan was developed by my team and we are committed to delivering results. On slide six, we have continued the process of rightsizing our manpower to match the current environment, while the majority of these reductions have also taken the form of furloughs in the Transportation Department. We have also taken steps within our engineering, mechanical and network and service management departments. On the locomotive side, aided by both our high velocity and an industry-wide reduction in volumes, we are currently storing high-adhesion road locomotives, and in addition, have removed units from our yard and local fleet. We did this through rightsizing against current volumes and fine tuning our local operating plan. We are also progressing with our DC to AC rebuilds, which will allow us to replace our aging Dash 9 locomotive fleet at a significant discount purchasing new locomotives. We anticipate these reductions in our fleet to lead to lower maintenance and repair costs, while reducing future capital requirements and improving the reliability and fuel efficiency of our locomotive fleet. As Jim outlined for you earlier on the call, and as you can see on slide seven. We are also taking a disciplined approach to reducing our operating costs. We recently announced that we are combining our Pocahontas and Virginia Divisions, which will reduced a number of operating divisions by close to 10% and will result in a reduction of division level supervision and back-office functions. We are also progressing with our plans to reduce from three operating regions to two. We are adapting rapidly and consistently. We are also idling our Ashtabula, Ohio coal terminal and we'll concentrate our Lake coal volumes at our Sandusky, Ohio coal terminal. We have however, retained all the business as part of this move. As mentioned in our last earnings call, we are continuing to rationalize investment in coal routes in Central Appalachian. We are ceasing operation on portions of our West Virginia Secondary between Columbus, Ohio and Charleston, West Virginia, which will result in a 250 mile reduction in maintained right-of-way. In all, we will rationalize our secondary line network by 1,000 miles this year and 1,500 miles by 2020. In closing, I want to emphasize that we are laser focused on ensuring Norfolk Southern has the most efficient and appropriate operating plan, which will streamline operations, while driving growth and profitability. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Marta to walk you through the quarter's financials. Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : Thank you, Mike. And good morning everyone. Slide two summarizes our operating results compared to last year's record setting quarter. As Alan already discussed, revenues declined by $352 million or 12% as a result of the lower fuel surcharge revenues and lower volume. Operating expenses decreased by $103 million or 5% aided by continued low fuel prices, but partially offset by restructuring cost. The net result was a $249 million or 28% reduction in income from railway operations and a 74.5% operating ratio for the quarter. Restructuring costs added 2 points to the operating ratio. As was the case in every quarter of 2015, fuel prices had a significant impact on our operating results and so we've summarized the net change on slide three. Taking a look at the top of the slide, the line graphs reflect the comparative WTI prices for 2014 and 2015. As you would expect, the quarters with the biggest gap had the largest reduction in fuel revenue. Also note that we were below most of our WTI base trigger points throughout 2015. Looking ahead to 2016, the forward curve projection for WTI is well below out most common trigger point of $64 a barrel. So the remaining on-highway diesel base surcharges should correlate more closely with our fuel expense this year. Now, let's take a look at operating expenses. I'd like to pause here and note that our team has been aggressively seeking to reduce to operating costs, while maintaining a well run service oriented railroad. We've taken specific actions to reduce cost in the near-term, and will continue to reduce cost in a manner consistent with the five-year plan Jim described earlier. In the fourth quarter, we decreased expenses by $103 million. Most of the decline was due to price as I just discussed, and we also had net reductions in purchase services and in compensation and benefits. These reductions were partially offset by increases in depreciation and in materials and other. Before we look at the specific expense line items, let's turn to an update on restructuring cost. Slide five summarizes the expenses which are related to the significant downsizing of our Triple Crown operations and to the closure of our Roanoke regional offices. The net effect of these costs reduced fourth quarter results by $0.10 a share. As shown on the following slide, our restructuring efforts had a significant impact on depreciation expense amounting to $37 million and resulting from the disposition of over 5,000 RoadRailer units. The remaining $10 million increase is associated with the growth in our asset base. Slide seven breaks up the components of our change in fuel expense. We've already covered the price related component and the consumption decline is related to the drop in traffic volume. As Mike has already explained, we expect our fuel efficiency metrics to improve in 2016. Slide eight depicts purchase services and rents which were down $12 million or 3%, reflecting the November 2015 secession of service in most Triple Crown lanes. As you know, this door-to-door service includes a significant amount of drayage and terminal operating costs, most of which went away after November 15 and accounted for an $18 million reduction. Partially offsetting this decline were the aforementioned restructuring cost and somewhat higher equipment rents associated with the increase in automotive traffic. Looking ahead to 2016, we expect purchase service costs to decline due to the Triple Crown restructuring. Turning to slide nine, we experienced a $12 million or 2% decrease in compensation costs. Lower incentive compensation of $41 million, combined with $13 million of reduced overtime was partially offset by increased pay rates of $13 million, a labor agreement lump sum payment of $13 million and $4 million of severance cost associated with the restructuring. In 2016, we expect continued reductions in overtime as well as a 4% decline in average head count year-over-year. On the other side of the equation, we expect wage and medical cost inflation up about 3.5% and a more normalized level of incentive comps. As shown on slide 10, the materials and other category increased by $27 million or 12%. Casualty claims costs were $20 million higher due to favorable personal injury development in the prior year, combined with case specific accruals required in 2015. Turning to income taxes on slide 11. The effective rate for the quarter were significantly lower at 31.1% versus 35.3% in 2014. This was largely attributable to three factors; the passage of the Tax Extenders Act in late December, which extended certain tax credits, the completion of an IRS audit and the effect of the state tax law change. Wrapping up our quarterly overview on slide 12. Net income was $361 million, a decline of a $150 million or 29% and diluted earnings per share were a $1.20, down 27% compared with the prior year. As a reminder, restructuring costs lowered these results by $31 million or $0.10 per share. Turning our focus to the full year on slide 13. Revenues were 10% lower than those in 2014, and expenses declined by 5%. The resulting income from railway operations of $2.9 billion was a 19% decline, which led to an increased operating ratio of 72.6% and a decrease in earnings per share to $5.10. Restructuring costs lowered these results by $58 million or $0.19 a share and added about 1 point to the operating ratio. Slide 14 summarizes our full-year cash flows. Cash from operations for the year was $2.9 billion, covering capital spending and producing almost $500 million in free cash flow. With respect to stockholders' returns, we repurchased $1.1 billion of stock and paid over $700 million in dividend. In 2016, we plan to resume repurchases at a rate of about $200 million per quarter. Moving on to this year's capital budget on slide 15. We plan to decrease total spending to $2.1 billion, similar to the renewed effort on aggressively managing our operating cost, we're also taking a more disciplined approach to capital spending. We are prioritizing capital allocation to our core network, and to projects that will fuel key areas of long-term growth. We believe this approach will enable the maintenance of high service levels as Mike described, and support the areas where Norfolk Southern will grow in the long-term, thereby maximizing our return on invested capital. As you can see from the pie on this slide, spending on our right-of-way including roadway and infrastructure is roughly in line with recent years, whereas equipment spending is lower. We've reduced freight car purchases, but increased locomotive acquisitions in keeping with the strategy Mike outlined relative to a younger fleet and lower maintenance cost. And with that, I thank you for your attention and I'll turn the program back to Jim. James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Marta. As you've heard this morning, our results reflect the current challenges in domestic and global markets, but looking to 2016 we are poised to achieve significant annual expense savings without compromising the company's ability to secure volume and revenue growth opportunities. We are executing a clear strategic plan to drive profitability and growth, and we expect to achieve an operating ratio below 65% by 2020. As a management team, we have the right people in place to deliver superior shareholder value through execution of our strategic plan. Before we move on to the Q&A portion of this call, I want to address recent developments with respect to Canadian Pacific. As you know, our board of directors has carefully reviewed and rejected three separate unsolicited proposals. The board and management team are committed to doing what is in the best interest of the company and all NS shareholders. That said, I want to ask that you focus your questions on today's call on our fourth quarter and full-year earnings, as well as our strategic plan and the additional information we disclosed today. With that, we'll now open the lines for Q&A. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Good morning. Thank you. I wanted to ask about your assumption from mix in the roughly 2.5% revenue per unit guidance that you outlined. So I guess, should we be thinking about pricing in the roughly 3% range and maybe negative impact of mix of about 0.5 point any color you could provide that will be helpful. Thanks. James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Thanks for the question. I think you have the basic formula about right. I'll turn it over to Alan in a minute. But let me say the big picture here is growth in intermodal volumes and lower coal volumes. And that has, as you point out, a negative mix impact overall. However, more than offset by pricing at a rate above inflation as we went through. Alan? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Allison, we are completely focused and committed to disciplined pricing moving forward, reflecting the value of our service product. But we don't anticipate the sharp negative headwinds in fuel surcharge revenue, coal and steel and frac sand and crude oil that we've had in the past. So we're going to focus primarily on growing our service-sensitive business and reflecting the long-term value of that business with our pricing. And we've been able to achieve five consecutive quarters of RPU growth ex-fuel and we believe that will continue. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, great. And my follow-up question, thinking about the $420 million of savings on the labor line, what are the specific head count expectations that are embedded within that? And could you give us a sense of what you're thinking about what that might imply from a GTM per employee or a carload per employee perspective? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Well again, I'll turn it over to Mike to talk about the specifics on the head count, but we're looking for roughly 2,000 fewer positions by 2020 and 1,200 fewer positions and about a 4% decrease in our overall workforce in 2016. So, Mike, you want to get into the specifics there a little bit? Michael Joseph Wheeler - Senior Vice President-Operations: Yeah. So, it is driven by the 2,000 head count reduction by 2020 as well as aggressive over time reduction by 2020, and we've already started that in 2016 and seen some good headways. And as we've said, that's about a 4% reduction for this year in our head count and we would expect that to translate directly into the gross ton miles per revenue. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alex Vecchio with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Alexander Vecchio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. So, Jim, I realize the forecast for coal to decline at a 1% CAGR is more conservative than some other estimates out there, but naturally a 1% decline over the next five years would suggest that the mix headwind from coal decline from a profitability standpoint would moderate pretty drastically versus what you've experienced over the last few years. So my question is, if coal volumes do end up declining, kind of closer to the mid to high single digits, as they have been over the past few years, do you still believe you'll be able to achieve your OR and EPS targets? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : What I'd liked to do is turn it over to Alan in a minute to give you some of the detail on how we built up the coal volume forecast, which as you point out, we do believe is conservative based on independent experts. But let me just say this about our plan, it is a dynamic flexible plan. If we do not see the growth in revenue because our coal volumes trend worse than we're expected or for whatever the reason, we will push even harder on the cost side. It's a flexible plan, we can dig deeper on the costs if we have to; we are intent on achieving the results we have outlined today. Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Alex, we know that coal volume will decline in 2016, and that's reflected in most indices. And then what we've done is we have looked at our individual plants, our individual customers, and then anchored that against independent experts. And we have come up with what we believe is a conservative plan going forward. Yes, there is risk; there is no doubt about it. But at gas price levels where they are today, coal-to-gas switching in our service region is effectively saturated. And so we do feel good about our coal forecast going forward; it's more conservative than outside experts, but we will adjust accordingly if we see the market dynamics change. Alexander Vecchio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That's helpful. And then my follow-up. So, you've given a lot more detailed guidance, which is great, and you've spoken a bit more specifically to your expectations for core pricing. I was wondering if maybe you'd be willing to begin disclosing more specifically your same store sale, core pricing metrics on a quarterly basis, as other Class 1s have been doing? And maybe if you could provide what that figure was in the fourth quarter? Thank you. James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Listen, let me just say this. With the leadership transitions here, everything is on the table, and we are certainly considering changes in a variety of areas, including our disclosure policy. Alan, you want to comment on the same-store sales number in the fourth quarter? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : It was above rail inflation. And we are going to continue to get improvement in that as we realize the full-year benefit of the contract rate increases that we negotiated with our customers this year. Also with a sharply declined fuel surcharge overhang, we'll see better improvement in RPU throughout the year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah. Good morning. And thank you for the detail on the five-year plan, that's helpful. Wanted to see if you could give me, this is probably for Mike or Jim, what broadly speaking, are some of your assumptions on train length and train starts over the five-year period? I guess, typically we think of train starts is driving costs and head count. And likewise, what you do on train lengths, that's an area that you can drive productivity. So are there any kind of broad thoughts you can provide on how you think those two parameters may move over the five-year period? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Well, first, train lengths are obviously an important driver of productivity, and fewer starts per train is also an important driver. And Mike, why don't you talk a little bit about the specifics there. Michael Joseph Wheeler - Senior Vice President-Operations: Yeah. So, on our train length, this last quarter, as well as last year, our train lengths were at our historic highs. And they were at our historic highs at the same time that our service levels were at their historic highs. So we feel pretty good about that going forward. Now, having said that, we continue to tactically look at what are the opportunities to run longer trains, and we do that daily and we got a team looking at that intensely. And we're also looking at strategically long-term, looking at longer trains and what we're doing there is, reviewing our operating plan and we continue to fine tune it to optimize the operating plan and it will allow us to not only run longer trains, but reduce our car miles and reduce handlings, and those go hand in hand with increased efficiency. So, we \u2013 while we feel like we're in a good place, we do see opportunity going forward. Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : I mean, maybe I should ask it a little bit differently. Is \u2013 do you have specific targets for change in train lengths that are part of the broader productivity plan? Is there a plan that you improve it 10%, 20% or is that not one of the key drivers in your five-year plan? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : No, it's not one of the ones that we put a specific metric on. We plan to improve it, but we don't have a target for that. Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And then I don't know, if I can get kind of a follow on or a different topic. But is there any implication for a long-term CapEx within the structural changes. If you take out 1,500 miles of track, does that help you get a lower CapEx number in the longer term? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : It does, it does. And that's one of the benefits of reducing the network footprint from the 1,000 miles of rationalization we're looking at this year and fully 1,500 miles by 2020. That does bring your CapEx down with respect to those lines and there were some expense benefit from that as well. And we are also looking at \u2013 trying to contain CapEx at a lower level overall than it has been at in the last several years. We pointed out again that we reduced CapEx last year, that was appropriate given the circumstances. This year's capital budget starting out is a double digit slower than last year's and that we'll continue to be flexible with CapEx as market conditions require. Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you for the time. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey, thanks. Good morning, everyone. So I wanted to follow up on the head count, because I guess you are talking about a 7% reduction in head count from here. It strikes me though that volumes were down 7% in the fourth quarter and your head count was up 2% while all the other rails had head count reductions in that 7% range. So it feels like 7% head count reduction is kind of just a catch up to what other rails have just done to respond to the weak volumes and if we're thinking about like real productivity savings. Why isn't there like a lot more head count potential here? Because that's where we can get the most confidence and visibility to real margin improvement, and it feels like there should be potential for a lot more and I guess I'm just not sure why we can't see that. James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : All right. Well, first let me just \u2013 we started at a lower level of head count overall. We built head count somewhat last year to get our service back up to where it needs to be. It's there, and now we can begin to modulate head count down. 1,200 fewer employees through a combination of attrition and furloughs this year would represent a 4% reduction in our workforce overall year-over-year. And we've given you the cost savings we expect from the attrition and the furloughs and other actions on comp and benefits. That's a big piece of the overall $650 million in productivity annualized by 2020 fully $420 million. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And then, just on the cash flow just for a minute. When do you think you can get back to kind of the historical 16%, 17% of revenue on CapEx. I guess a follow-up to what Tom was just asking. And then Marta, any thoughts on why you're slowing the buybacks in 2016? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Well, let's talk about CapEx first and I'll let Marta cover buybacks second. We're targeting about 19% of revenue through the completion of PTC, which takes us through 2018. After that, we intend to bring CapEx down to around 17%. We think that's a level of reinvestment, given other assumptions it generates an adequate return for shareholders, an excellent return for shareholders in fact. Marta, why don't you talk about the buybacks? Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : Okay. In the share repurchases we discussed, we're beginning at a run rate this quarter of $200 million, which would imply right now $800 million for the year, and that's very much in line with what we've done over the last 10 years, we'd averaged about $1 billion. So some years a little bit higher, some years a little bit lower. We finished 2015 at $1.1 billion, so we're comfortable with that level of guidance for now. James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : And I do want to point out Scott, our board is very focused on buybacks right now, that's a big part of our strategy, it has been in the past, as we went through. We have kicked out to shareholders fully $15 billion through buybacks and dividends in the past and we will continue to buyback our shares. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Thank you guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Barnes with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. John Barnes - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for the time. I just want to go back to coal for a second, because I think, we're struggling a little bit with the numbers in terms of kind of the growth outlook. I mean, if I assume that 2016 is going to be down something similar to what the other rails are talking about, let's say it's a mid-teens type of decline this year, regardless of whether or not your franchise is less at risk to more switching on natural gas or something like that. You're still implying something like mid single-digit compounded annual growth from like 2017 through 2020. I think that when you look at the change in the Eastern utilities portfolio, whether it's the introduction of more nuclear or what have you, that just seems like a big number, a big target out there for growth, I mean and certainly that's a growth number not stabilization. So can you just talk a little bit more about, how you start to see that upswing, and where this kind of CAGR of down one kind of fits with, something that looks like, it's more up mid-single-digit in the out years? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : We are not looking for growth in golden out years. So, 2016 is another leg down in coal volumes and after that we see stabilization in the coal volumes and I will let Alan return to the specific assumptions that underlie that. But let me just reemphasize that ours is a flexible plan. We know this is a tough environment in which to talk about growth, and that's why we're so focused on cost reductions, on maintaining excellent service, and on safety. If we do those three things, we will have a successful 2016 and we will continue to drive on those three things as hard as we possibly can beyond 2016, and we expect the results to offset any decline in volumes or revenue that we might experience contrary to our expectations. Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. We know that much of the coal decline this year is the result of the warm weather, and with coal dispatching behind natural gas, it is much more volatile with weather conditions. We're very clear that our guidance, once stockpiles normalize, is dependent upon normal weather patterns. We also know that the opportunity for coal to gas switching in our specific service region, and particularly in the southeast is muted going forward. But to be clear, we are not looking for growth in our coal franchise. We expect it to decline, we're going to manage it very closely and continue to manage the resources that are applied against it. John Barnes - RBC Capital Markets LLC : And what assumption have you made for coal shutdowns within the franchise in that forecasted amount? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Most of the additional natural gas plants that have been announced in the southeast are not targeted at specific NS plants. Up in the PJM, there is more crossover and there is more risk, and we've taken that into account that there is a specific plant in the southeast, that's been taken into account in our franchise too. So it comes in conjunction with looking at the announced natural gas plant additions in the next couple of years and talking to our customers about it. So, we do have some of it in there more predominant in the Northeast. John Barnes - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. All right. And then, my follow-up question. Thanks for the color. My follow-up is, you talked 1,500 miles of track disposal. I know you guys sell real estate every year. So, you kind of know how to do it, but my question on track disposal going forward is, it seems like a lot of this is going to be stuff that maybe it doesn't have a lot of value left to short-line rail. There is not enough volume originating on that particular track. So, I'm curious. I mean, should we expect lower proceeds from track sales going forward, just because there's less value on them? I mean, are these going to be turned into really nice bike paths or something like that or is there still some value to be had to a short-line? Is there still enough volume originating on that 1,500 miles, if there is some value there? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : I think the way to view this, John, is not as a real estate transaction or a real estate strategy, but as a network optimization strategy. And it's a mechanism by which we can bring down future capital spending associated with these lines as we had said, and also to some extent reduce expenses. And Alan, do you want to elaborate at all on the customer effects of some of this, the short-line potential? Some of this maybe \u2013 may be Delta short-line. Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Some of it will be Delta short-line, so, we can continue to handle the business. And the ultimate goal is to ensure that with a short-line handle, we do not increase the cost to the supply chain. John Barnes - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. All right. Thanks for your time today. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to touch on sort of the broad volume outlook for 2016. So, understanding sort of where you guys are thinking about coal, but when you think about the entire book of business, how should we think about that in 2016? It sounds like the first quarter is going to be tougher, but how does it look after that? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Certainly, it remains a challenging macro environment. Alan will go through the specific assumptions for 2016. But again, let me say, this is why we are so focused on cost savings, on maintaining service and on safety. Those will be the three pillars of our success in 2016. The growth will come; this is a long-range plan, and over the course of five years, we do expect to grow. And we all know how powerful growth and pricing can be for the bottom line in the long run. Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : The largest headwinds that we have right now with respect to near-term volume are, coal inventory levels and retail inventory levels. Once those get worked through, we do see some growth, because we're coming off a year in which we had minimal growth. We have a very strong intermodal franchise, our improved service product is going to direct more of that business back to our lines and our \u2013 the domestic sector as we move into the second half of the year, we have a lot of strength in our international franchise that once retail inventory levels are normalized that will pick up, and we have strengthen in our automotive franchise. So, we do have some franchises that have opportunities for growth. We had a record volume in chemicals last year, and we had record volume in intermodal too despite the Triple Crown restructuring. Also note that Triple Crown will have a negative impact on volume comps, particularly for the first three quarters of the year. But we do feel that as we progress through the year, and as we take advantage of our service products and as inventory levels whether in retail or in coal normalize, we're going to start to see significant improvement. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. But you're not predicating that that outlook for 2016 on volume growth, it sound like that? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : No, there is certainly opportunity there, but we're watching it very closely, because there is a lot of uncertainty around commodities and a lot of uncertainty on when, particularly the retail inventory levels get reversed. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Sure, that's helpful. Appreciate that. James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : We're actively managing it with operations, to make sure we're sizing, our resources appropriately. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. That's great. And just a quick follow up if I may, just on the fuel surcharge side. Marta thanks for the incremental details that you've been giving us, in terms of fuel surcharge. As you see the WTI program, sort of bottom out here in January and then going forward, how should we think about the headwind to operating profit, you've sort of laid that out in the slide, just kind of curious if there is a view that you can give us for 2016, when you think about that, sort of what's included in terms of either a headwind or sort of neutral impact from the fuel surcharge to profit in 2016? Thanks. Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : Okay. So, as Alan described, in the first quarter, that's the \u2013 the first quarter is the one that will have the toughest comp compared to 2015, because recall that the first quarter of 2015 in January, some of those WTI, once we're kicking in. So, we had $163 million of fuel surcharge in the first quarter of 2015. So, year-over-year, the biggest decline that we will see, we expect if the forward curve stays like it is now, will be in the first quarter. Nevertheless, for all of the year, for all of the quarters, we expect to have a much less net operating profit effect, because our fuel expenses will be going down more commensurately with our fuel revenue, if we stay in this oil price environment. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. That's helpful. Thanks for the time guys. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah. Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. So Jim, I know you said at the outset that you don't really want to talk about CP, but I'm getting plenty of emails here from investors that would like to discuss it. So I guess in that context, I just want to respectfully ask, we've heard from these plans from Norfolk over the years that you guys always target peer margins, but we now have Canadian National, Canadian Pacific, Union Pacific all in the low 60%s even cleaned up for the currency benefits of North. And we're still struggling with the coal guidance. I think there was a question earlier about how do you get through negative 1% CAGR when you're guiding 15% down this year? Clearly, 4Q was a pretty challenging year even after you take out the restructuring charges. And I don't think that we would argue that any of those big railroads that are running at a low 60%s OR right now are in some sort of unsustainable or less safe operating condition than they were when they were running back in the 80%s or even 90%s OR. So, with your plan to drive about $600 million, $650 million of productivity improvements in the next five years in CP's plan, which I would argue is backed up by a management team that has demonstrated the ability to do this in a very quick fashion, I think CP's plan is close to $1.2 billion over the same timeframe. So, what is it about your business that you feel CP does not understand that makes shareholders better off with $650 million of improvement versus a low 60%s OR and a $1.2 billion improvement plan? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : So, we've outlined a plan today to get to a sub 65% operating ratio by 2020. And as I said, we won't stop there. There is more we can do. We're going to continue to drive our operating ratio, as low as we possibly can go with it. It's a good plan, it's a balanced plan, it contains a major component of cost cutting and we understand the need for that. That's absolutely critical, it's a flexible plan. If we don't see the growth, we will find additional ways to reduce expenses. It's a specific plan, it's the right plan for our markets, our franchise and our customers. Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Well, as a follow up then, so are you saying that $1.2 billion of improvement is just nowhere near attainable and the timeframe that they've laid out, can Norfolk ever get to a 60% operating ratio or is that just off the table for your network? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : As I said, 65% is the starting point for us, that's what we've said, we're going to try achieve by 2020. We may be able to go faster, we'll see. After we reach 65%, we're going to continue to drive it lower. Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt Troy with Nomura. Please proceed with your question. Matt Troy - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Yeah, thanks. I was just wondering, if you could help us with the economics of the Pocahontas Division, now that's being consolidated? Just curious, if you could size the magnitude of the royalties, will your disclosure change with respect to how it's presented and how much of a headwind that might be and the timing of that headwind, as it runs off? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : So, I think Matt, we're talking about two different things here. The division consolidation that Mike went through reflects a strategy to reduced G&A, streamline operations and streamline the organization. The core royalties you referenced, appear in our other income, as part of rental and other income. Marta, maybe you could give us a run rate on that? Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : Yes. As you've mentioned, those have been decreasing of course with the decline in coal prices. So, Matt that will continue to be reported in other income and depending on prices \u2013 and depending on coal prices that will continue \u2013 perhaps continue to decline. So, that's reflected in our charts, in our book that we put out and they were down $4 million in the fourth quarter and $14 million for the full year. Matt Troy - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: But the divisional reorganization in and itself has no affect on... Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : I am glad you asked that question, because with both of them having our cooperation that handles the core royalty is being called Pocahontas and the division being called Pocahontas, we don't want any confusion there. Matt Troy - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Understood. Thank you. And just as my follow up, you mentioned share repurchases, that's a big part of your plan and you gave us the targeted payout ratio of 33% and the return of $15 billion to shareholders. Just curious, maybe Marta, what are the guard rails in terms of balance sheet leverage or capital structure with respect to credit rating or leverage ratios, you're comfortable pushing up against in order to drive share repurchases over time? Just want to refresh on where you think Norfolk is comfortable with respect to some of those credit metrics? Thank you. Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : Thanks. As you know that share repurchases is just one part of our total capital allocation policy. It is a very important, as Jim mentioned our board is very focused on it. What we are doing is, we are making sure that we stay within our credit ratings band, but we want to make sure, we leverage as much as we can of that, and that's what we have done buying back over \u2013 little over 1 billion a year on average over the last 10 years. So, right now our expectation is that we will stay within that band and push as much of our free cash flow into share repurchases combined with the appropriate amount of leverage. Matt Troy - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: But, just trying to get specifically as we think about modeling, you are willing to lever up more than where you are today? Is there an upper band that you think is acceptable? Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : As our sheet grows and as our profits grow with this five-year plan that Jim has described, we expect to grow our share repurchase program with it. Matt Troy - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: All right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rob Salmon with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, good morning, and thanks for taking the question. I guess, Jim, as a clarification for your 2016 OR guidance, you guys highlighted a bunch of track mile sales, as well as the Roanoke office. So I would imagine it's going to be sold. Should we be contemplating that there is some? Could you clarify to the extent that gains are incorporated in that sub-70% OR guidance that you're targeting for the full year, because obviously it's a tough volume backdrop, and there'll be some mix headwinds as well, as we lookout to this year? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : So, speaking specifically to real estate sales, gain on real estate sales including any gain we record on sale of the Roanoke office building would not be included in operating income, but would be below the operating income line in other income. So that would have no impact on the operating ratio. And the proceeds from any line sales I think would be rather minimal in conjunction with the restructuring or rationalization of the 1,000 miles we've referred to. There could be some proceeds from that, but again, the main focus of that is reduction in capital spending, and to some extent, expenses going forward. Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Understood, and I appreciate that clarification there. I guess, getting back to Tom's earlier question with regard to sidings. In asking it a little bit differently, could you give us a sense of what the siding capacity is today across your different franchises and it what the train length currently stands at? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Mike? Michael Joseph Wheeler - Senior Vice President-Operations: Yeah, sure. Most of our sidings form the railroad are 8,000 feet long. As we build new sidings, and we've built a lot of new sidings over the years, and we've built some up in the 10,000-foot, 11,000-foot, 12,000-foot range, so we've got a lot of siding capacity out there relative to the size of the trains we're running now. Our intermodal trains are running around 6,000 feet on average; a lot of capacity there. And the rest of the overall network is in the 5,000 feet to 6,000 feet, so we have got plenty of capacity on our sidings out there. Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you so much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question. Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Yeah, thank you for the time this morning. So when framing your targeted expense reductions, I want to confirm that we should use 2015's GAAP results as a baseline and better understand how we should incorporate what are natural volume driven OpEx fluctuations and general expense inflation to those numbers going forward? So since volume and sensitive cost should be down in 2016, is your $130 million productivity target for the year \u2013 is that fully incremental to the cost savings that you naturally see from lower volumes? And maybe longer term, as volumes return to growth per the plan, how should we compare that rise in volume-driven expense and the broader cost inflation you'll see to your longer term target for $650 million in savings over five years? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Okay. So first, comparisons are to GAAP results in 2015, so the cost savings that we have outlined are in relation to GAAP reported earnings in 2015. And Marta, why don't you take us through the dynamics of the productivity and other elements of the question. Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : Yes, they are compared to GAAP. The $130 million in savings does not include the benefit of the restructuring cost. So if you're looking year-over-year and you're looking at total expenses, you would expect a decline of $130 million plus the $93 million of the restructuring costs that we had. Otherwise, it's all in there, the pluses and the minuses. So I mean if we have growth, if we have volume growth you're exactly right. We would have incremental expenses associated with that volume growth and that would not be in the $130 million. Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay. Understood. And maybe from a high level, just looking at the guidance to get below 70% OR this year. If I plug the 70% OR into consensus revenues, it looks like something around 10% year-over-year EPS growth on your 2015 GAAP base of about 5% to 10%. Is that the bogey that we should be looking at or is there something underlying maybe consensus revenue is too high or something else that we should be thinking about before using that as kind of our sense of your internal targets here? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Look, we say sub 65% operate \u2013 excuse me, sub 70% operating ratio in 2016 is our goal, and that's what we're working toward through whatever combination of growth or lack thereof, and expense savings. If we're heading into a recession, obviously the degree of difficulty gets that much higher, but we are committed to this goal and we're pushing hard to achieve it. Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : And I will point out too that ,and Alan can elaborate on this, but I would point out too that while we're expecting volume declines in coal, that's not the case for all of our commodity groups. Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : We'll pivot if we need to as well. And if we need to pivot harder on costs we will certainly do that. We're not going to sacrifice our service, but everything else is on the table, we'll cut whatever we need to cut short of hurting service. Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : I guess just a follow up on that, if volumes do come in, kind of as you expected is something approaching the double-digits on your GAAP earnings base the question for this year? Or is that within the range of possibilities in your view? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : I mean, you can do math on the EPS effect of driving the operating ratio below 70%. Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : All right. Thank you for the time. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Jason H. Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you operator and good morning everyone. First question has to do with your CapEx going forward. Obviously with shutting down some of your lines that you had with coal and looking at the shutdown, I think, what did you say, you have 1,500 miles of track, rearranging some of your locomotive needs and car types, where is the new mix going to be? Is the mix going to change in terms of what you're investing in as we look in Norfolk Southern in 2020 versus 2015? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Well by 2020, we will be done with PTC, and so you will see that roll out. You'll see more focus on core investments in our core network; that will certainly be part of the equation all the way out to 2020. We will continue to invest in locomotives and equipment and other structures and other critical aspects of the infrastructure. So other than the absence of PTC, no major change in the mix of our investments other than perhaps greater concentration on core lines. Jason H. Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. That's a good clarification. And, Marta, just to get some clarification for 2017 kind of in relation to everyone trying to pinpoint an EPS number for you, you talked about your tax rate dropping down. It sounded like there were several items that hit it, but it sounded like some of these items might be continuing into 2016 here. What should we look at in terms of your tax rate for the year? Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : Yes, you're correct about that. The Tax Extenders Act also extended the credits already for this year. So we would expect \u2013 in prior years, we've guided to an effective tax rate about 37.5%, but for 2016 we think it will be more like 37% even. Jason H. Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC: 37% even? Okay, thank you so much for the time as always. Operator : Our next question comes from line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Good morning, Jim, Marta, Mike and Alan. If we look back at the plan on page eight, you see a lot of revenue growth, and I just want to understand in this slower growth market, you're expecting pricing to scale up to 2.5% from zero over the last few years. Your volume growth to accelerate \u2013 and I don't know \u2013 it says 2015 to 2020, so I don't know if you're counting 2015 and 2016 within that CAGR, which would be a pretty big upside for 2017 through 2020. But does that set up for trouble, I guess more importantly how much of the 65% is built on revenue top-line versus the costs that you've laid out? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : In the plan, revenue growth is an important driver of operating ratio improvement and bottom line improvement as well. And right now it's a difficult environment in which to pitch growth, we understand that. And that's why we're so focused on cost savings, right now. Cost savings, keeping our service at the current level and running a safe railroad are our top priorities in 2016 and we will do what we need to do to achieve the results. That's the other thing to appreciate about the plan; it's a flexible plan, a dynamic plan. If we need to pivot to a different strategy, we certainly can and will. Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. But is there a limit of how much in that 65% is tied to the top line versus your cost? I'm just trying to understand at least for the base case that you've set so as things change, we can kind of understand what shifts need to be taken on maybe more aggressive cost-cutting? Is the plan based half on top line, half on costs, or as it is right now? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : There are elements of both in the plan. It's a balanced plan. We think it's the right plan for our markets, our customers and our franchise. It does assume some volume growth, and pricing as well. Now, Alan feels confident about the pricing potential here. The volume growth is obviously a bit more of a wildcard. We think we have the opportunity to grow volume over this five-year period. Pricing coupled with even modest growth is an important driver of bottom line performance for us, and everybody else in the industry. If we have to pivot to a different strategy and take the expenses down even more aggressively, we will. Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks. And if I give you follow-up on Triple Crown, Alan, maybe just a little bit on volumes. Why did the Triple Crown, when you shut it down, volumes not turn back to intermodal? Did it lose to truck or are they still in transition? And then, I guess ultimately, why was it eliminated? I presume because it wasn't additive to margins. So, just want to understand that shift in the business, why you weren't able to recapture it in kind of different ways, whether it's through third-party or what have you? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Ken, that's a good question. We've worked with our channel partners to get as much of it back as possible. But almost by definition, the Triple Crown franchise was set up not to compete with our conventional intermodal franchise. So there's not a lot of overlap. It's not yet fully defined how much we'll move back into our intermodal network. And frankly, Ken, we're seeing some move into our merchandise network too, which once again underscores the benefit of our improved service product that our merchandise network can compete for Triple Crown business. James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Remember... Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So it's still on transition, is what you are saying? Because it seems like a lot of obviously that opportunity \u2013 was it lost again to truck or is it still moving around? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Ken, most of it will ultimately be lost to truck. Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Because our conventional network does not run in a lot of the lanes that Triple Crown ran in. James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : The important takeaway here though is, as we have said, despite the volume decline, we expect the restructuring to be accretive to earnings modestly. Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Helpful. Thank you very much for the time. I appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.: Thanks, and good morning. I wanted to just follow-up on the 2016 volume question to be clear on that front. Is your guidance for a sub-70% OR assuming that volumes are down this year? And if so, could you talk about the magnitude of the volume decline you're expecting? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : The volumes are currently in play right now and it's a tough start to the year, no doubt about it. If we're heading into a recession, this is going to be a tough slog for everybody. We will pivot to additional cost cutting if we have to, we \u2013 the sub-70% operating ratio is our goal and we're going to do whatever we possibly can short of going into recession and that makes life difficult for all of us, for sure. But, sub-70% is our goal, we are working hard to achieve it through a combination of expense reductions and whatever volume and pricing increases we can manage. Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Got it. And, maybe to just follow-up on the OR target for 2016. So, you highlighted in 2015, the OR was 71.7%, when you exclude the impact from Roanoke and Triple Crown, is there any way to frame up how much of the improvement, half of that base, you expect in 2016 just from the strategic changes you've made if you total up the impact from Roanoke, Triple Crown and some of the other changes in the coal network? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : So again, remember, we're comparing to GAAP results including the restructuring charges in 2015. That gives you a head start on lower expenses right there in 2016, but that doesn't factor in the $130 million in productivity savings we're looking for. Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. And one last quick one on that. Marta, sorry if I missed it, but D&A obviously has taken a step up. What's your expectation for D&A this year? Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : Pardon me. What did you say? Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.: Depreciation and amortization. Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : Depreciation. James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. That was up in part, because of the Triple Crown restructuring. Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : Yes. Yes. So, depreciation, when you exclude the restructuring charge, was up $10 million in the fourth quarter. And so, we would expect a similar amount in each quarter \u2013 to increase it in each quarter in 2016. Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Very helpful. Thanks for the time. Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please proceed with your question. Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities, Inc.: Thanks very much, and good morning. So, your service metrics improved quite significantly in Q4, but it looks like a lot of that was pretty backend loaded. So, from a cost perspective, even though your T&E overtime was down, and your recrews were down. It would seem like you wouldn't have realized that full benefit in Q4. I was just wondering if you could help us to think about that particular issue? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : That's true. That's true. We did not see the full benefit of the service improvements in terms of expense reductions in Q4. Mike, talk a little bit about the trend and what we expect in the first quarter. Michael Joseph Wheeler - Senior Vice President-Operations: Yeah. If you look at the service metrics through the quarter, they did improve each month through the quarter and it was near the end of the quarter that we got back to our historic highs, which is what we're currently operating at. And that's why we feel like the productivity savings we've got going forward are going to be very, very achievable, because we did get to that level now. Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities, Inc.: So, do you happen to have what T&E overtime and recrews would have looked like year-over-year in December, as an example? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Hang on just a second. Michael Joseph Wheeler - Senior Vice President-Operations: So, what's the question? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : What did it look like in December to give us a run-rate for first quarter? Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : Just for T&E. I gave the whole $13 million for the entire quarter, Mike, was the reduction in overtime. And so, what we're saying is that occurred disproportionately. James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Right, right. Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : In December, so. James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Right, right, correct. We don't have that broken out just by December. Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities, Inc.: Okay, that's fine. But it was back-end loaded? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Correct. Yeah, it was back-end loaded as the improvements happen sequentially each month through the quarter. Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities, Inc.: Right, that's all my questions. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Larkin with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi, good morning, everybody. And thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to dive a little more deeply into the rationalization of the coal network, which I guess will net 1,000 fewer truck miles this year and 1,500 in total through 2020. Are there any regulatory hurdles that have to be negotiated through here especially this year, as you're talking about taking so many miles out of the system, particularly if there is an abandonment that is required, given that maybe some of these lines are going to be attractive to short run or regional railroads? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : First the 1,000 miles we are targeting in 2016 and the 1,500 miles by 2020 are not limited to the coal network, that would be across the entire expanse of our network. Now a lot of that will be in the coal fields for sure. Second in general, these line rationalizations would not require regulatory approval, because they will not be full-scale abandonments. John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you. And then I think you called out the continuing program to convert DC locomotives over to AC locomotives. Could you give us a sense for, how many locomotives are involved in that program? And what the savings per locomotives would be relative to purchasing new AC locomotives? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : It's an important program, very important part of our long-term capital strategy for locomotives. Mike? Michael Joseph Wheeler - Senior Vice President-Operations: Yeah, so if you kind of look at the run rate, you have to look at it pretty far out, because we've got about 1,200 of these Dash 9 locomotives that are starting to hit the age, where you got to do something with them. So we'll be doing these 1,200 locomotives over the next 10, 10-plus years. And the cost to rebuild is about half the cost of a new locomotive and we get a great reliable locomotive with increased tractive effort. So we're pretty excited. And the early indications are really, really positive on the test results. John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So order of magnitude on the savings per locomotives maybe in the neighborhood of a $1 million, $1.5 million somewhere in that range? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Capital versus buying new? John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes. James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, that's probably about, right. Yeah. John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Buckingham Research. Please proceed with your question. Mr. Kauffman, your line is live. Jeff A. Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Thank you. Thank you very much. Sorry, I had you on mute. Most of my questions at this point have been answered, but let me come back to Marta with a detailed question. When you're talking $2.1 billion of CapEx, that's a gross CapEx number right, not a net CapEx number? Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : That's correct. That's all of our capital for 2016 and the components are in that pie that was in one of my slides. Jeff A. Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. I saw the slide, I just want to make sure I was counting it right. And that's it, all my other questions have been answered. Good luck. Thank you. Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein Investment Research. Please proceed with your question. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey good morning. Alan, just a question for you on the fuel surcharge program. It says you're \u2013 here on the slide deck that you're shifting from WTI to diesel. I guess the first question is, are you expecting to get a 100% of the fuel revenue that you lost through these new fuel programs or will we also be seeing some of that recovery in the lost fuel revenue in core price? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : We're going to see much of the recovery in core price, because new fuel surcharge programs are paying pretty low also and as we compete with modal competition, their fuel surcharge programs are low too. So, we're focused primarily on price. We do not want to give up price to move to an on-highway diesel fuel surcharge program, but we are making progress in that arena. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: And as far as kind of the progress you are making like is it the number of years to get that lost fuel revenue back as core price? Is this like a three-year, five-year, one-year, like how long do you think this is going to take to kind of reclaim some of that lost value that you had from the design of the surcharge program? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah David, it's a multiyear program for us, because our contracts average a term in excess of three plus years. So, that's one hurdle to getting it done immediately. The other hurdle is the volatility in the commodity prices. And our \u2013 once again, our commitment to focusing on price and not given up pricing just to move to another fuel surcharge program that may also be out of the money. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. And then, Marta, maybe just as a quick follow-up. The $200 million a quarter or so that you're going to do through buybacks, are you planning to add more leverage this year or is this all going to come organically from operations? Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : We'll add leverage in keeping with the size of our balance sheet. I mean, you can see if you look over our past few years of our balance sheet, you can see that we're borrowing up to about 2.5 times EBITDA. So, we're going to keep our balance sheet strong, keep within our credit ratings band. So, it will be a mix of using the cash that we have on hand, the profits from operations and leverage. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. So, we should expect some added leverage this year then? Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : Yeah. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, good morning. Hey, Marta, just real quick on the CapEx spend wheel in the deck. Can you guys split out the $2.1 billion between growth and maintenance CapEx? Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : Yes. We can. It's basically in line with what as Jim said was not a huge change from our past strategy. So, if you \u2013 if you pull out PTC, which you could see... Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Right. Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : ... there is about $246 million; the remainder is about two-thirds, one-third core and growth. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Perfect. And then, I'm curious. So, why does that 17% of sales, feel like the right spend number by 2020, I mean you've got PTC falling off, you're going to have 1,500 miles of mainline that will be rationalize, service creates latent capacity, all the heavy lifting on intermodal has long been done by that point and your loco plans really focus more on rebuild. So I mean why wouldn't that number potentially be a lot lower than 2017. And I guess I just want to be comfortable that you and the Board are really focused on maximizing free cash flow and not necessarily OR or EPS? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Of course. Of course, we're very focused on free cash flow and free cash flow equals cash from operation minus capital spending. So from that standpoint, lower capital spending is better. But we do certainly have a lot of replacement needs going forward. And it's a very asset intensive business we're in here. And we expect to continue to aggress to invest appropriately prudently, but responsibly to keep that investment in great shape for our customers. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: So real quickly to that point though, I mean you're spending call it, $600 million for growth this year. So is that about how much capital you need to spend to simply grow the business 2% to 3%? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Well I think, by 2020 the growth capital starts to moderate and probably before then, in fact. As you know, we have built out a best-in-class intermodal terminal network, we're in the final stages of completing that terminal network, that takes some of the pressure off the growth part of CapEx. It's conceivable, we could bring CapEx down further that certainly would be healthy from the standpoint of free cash flow, but we also want to make sure that we are investing responsibly for a safe and efficient operation. Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : Yes. And I think you should consider that 17% to be just a general guideline. And not a \u2013 not to exceed sort of thing, not (96:20). Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Perfect. Thank you guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Cleo Zagrean with Macquarie. Please proceed with your question. Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Good morning, and thank you for your time. My first question is about the flexibility of your five year cost reduction plan. Where is the high flexibility you see? Please help us understand where is the highest opportunity for cutting costs like you said without affecting services. Maybe by highlighting, where do you think your network offers more opportunity versus peers and then in case demand is lower, what kind of pivoting do you have in mind? Thank you. James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : So, we went through the categories of cost savings. We're targeting in the $650 million. Labor is the biggest contributor and then, reduce fuel consumption in the car fleet and locomotive maintenance. Additional cost savings would come from all of the above. We would be seeking to call each of those cost levers even harder, if we have to. And we would be seeking additional cost savings as well through adjustment of our network in kind of long-term down volume scenario. Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Appreciate that. And then, my follow up relates to intermodal. This quarter, we saw pricing down about 2% ex-fuel. Can you help us understand what drove that, was it new business, was it renewals with existing customers, some mix impact? And then, if you could share with us your outlook for present volume growth this year for domestic and international, I would really appreciate that. Thank you. James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Alan? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey, Cleo. The reason why we saw the decline in pricing or RPU ex-fuel for intermodal in the fourth quarter was the Triple Crown restructuring. If you strip that out, RPU ex-fuel for intermodal was actually up 4%. Reflective of the pricing actions that we've taken throughout the year. Our customers are committed in the intermodal network to long-term growth and they understand that we need to be able to invest in their \u2013 in the network to accommodate the growth. And so we're taking a long-term view of this. We're accelerating pricing across all markets, as we push to a disciplined market based pricing approach. Intermodal will be taxed in the first half of the year, due to the Triple Crown restructuring, but as we bring back more domestic business with our approved service product and continue to benefit from shifts to East Coast ports. We expect volumes in our intermodal franchise to improve throughout the year. Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our final question will come from the line of Ben Hartford with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Ben J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks for fitting me in here. Take a look at that, that five year outlook for intermodal, the 5% annualized growth. I'm assuming that domestic intermodal you're expecting to exceed international. One, I want to confirm that. And then, two, if that's the case, kind of implied upper single digit annualized domestic intermodal volume growth going forward. I mean is it safe to assume that your outlook \u2013 your intermediate term outlook for intermodal domestic, intermodal really hasn't materially changed, despite the fact that crude now is close to $30 as opposed to $100 about a year ago. Any perspective on that, that'd be helpful. Thank you. James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Compared to the compound annual growth rate for our intermodal franchise in last five years, we actually do see a slowing of growth. Alan give us a little color on that. Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, Ben. Frankly, it's consistent with the rest of our five-year plan, it's conservative. It is less than what we've had in the past, but it's a number at which we can continue to push price and continue to encourage additional business on our lines, as trucking regulations are implemented in the last half of 2017, it's going to tighten capacity in 2016. And so that will be a spark for domestic intermodal growth. And we've talked frequently about the strength of our international franchise, and a continued shift mix from West Coast to East Coast ports, and our strategic alignment with shipping partners who are adding capacity to the East Coast. Ben J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. So, in that 5% outlook, do you have assumed domestic intermodal volume growth exceeding international? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : It approximates, and so we feel like there is a level of conservatism in our plan. Ben J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. Mr. Squires, I would now like to turn the floor back over to you for concluding comments. James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Thank you all for questions today, and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.",

(Broker) Operator : Greetings and welcome to the Norfolk Southern Corporation First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. And a question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Katie Cook. Thank you. Ms. Cook, you may now begin. Katie U. Cook - Director- Investor Relations : Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon. Before we begin today's call, I would like to mention a few items. First, the slides of the presenters are available on our website at norfolksouthern.com in the Investors section. Additionally, transcripts and downloads of today's call will be posted on our website. As noted in our disclosures found on slide two of our presentation, please be advised that during this call, we may make certain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially from those projected. Please refer to our Annual and Quarterly Reports filed with the SEC for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. Additionally, keep in mind that all references to reported results, excluding certain adjustments, that is non-GAAP numbers, have been reconciled on our website in the Investors section. Now, it is my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's, Chairman, President and CEO, Jim Squires. James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Norfolk Southern's first quarter of 2016 earnings call. With me today are NS's Chief Marketing Officer, Alan Shaw; our Chief Operating Officer, Mike Wheeler; and our Chief Financial Officer, Marta Stewart. We'll share the details of our strong first quarter financial results with you momentarily. But let me begin by saying how proud I am of the men and women of Norfolk Southern who are so successfully executing our strategic plan their flexibility and initiative are driving shareholder value even in the midst of a challenging and ever-changing marketplace. Turning to our results on slide four, our team delivered a record-setting first quarter operating ratio of 70.1%, 630 basis points lower than last year's first quarter. This performance was in the face of weak commodities, a strong dollar, and coal volumes down 23%. Norfolk Southern's earnings for the first quarter were $1.29 per share, 29% higher than last year's dollar per share. Marta will go over the details shortly. We were able to generate these results; thanks in large part to improved network performance. Mike will follow with an update on operations. But let me highlight here that our team increased the composite service measure by 23%, increased train speeds by 15%, and reduced terminal dwell by 14%. These strong improvements helped us control costs, while enhancing the value of our product. Better service is, of course, a pre-requisite to growth and a foundation of our strategy. It is what allowed us to grow in the first quarter in markets like automotive and intermodal even within a challenging macroenvironment. Furthermore, this focus on improved service helped to counterbalance weakness in commodities like coal and crude oil. Alan will share all the details of our top line results in a moment. With respect to our strategic plan, and as noted on slide five, our focus on strengthening Norfolk Southern is yielding results. We are now on track to achieve productivity savings of about $200 million for the full-year, up from our previous target of $130 million, and we still expect to achieve a full-year operating ratio below 70%. Last quarter, we showcased a number of initiatives to right-size our asset base. As this year progresses, we continue to explore and implement additional initiatives, including, as we announced yesterday, our reduced train operations at Knoxville yard. By 2020, we expect to achieve annual productivity savings of over $650 million through cost reductions in labor, materials, fuel, and purchased services. Our plan is dynamic, and our longer-term expectations include growth in both pricing and volumes. As previously noted, we are targeting 2.5% compound annual growth in pricing, and a similar rate of growth in volumes over the five-year plan period. Our goal, as we have said, is a sub-65% operating ratio by 2020, accompanied by double-digit compound annual growth in EPS. Based on our strong first quarter results, we are clearly moving in the right direction. Our plan also provides for significant return of capital to shareholders. Over the past 10 years, Norfolk Southern distributed nearly $15 billion through share repurchases and dividends. This year, we plan to distribute $800 million through share repurchases, while continuing a steadfast commitment to maintaining our dividend. We have the right team in place. They have demonstrated their ability to perform. Delivering superior shareholder value is their abiding objective and mine. I have every confidence as shown by our strong start to 2016 that this team will go above and beyond to produce results. I'll now turn the program over to Alan, Mike and Marta, who will provide more details on our 2016 results and outlook, and then, return with some closing comments before taking your questions. Alan? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon to our audience. We appreciate you're joining us today. On slide seven, you can see that our first quarter revenue declined 6% year-over-year to $2.4 billion. A majority of the decrease was attributable to lower on-highway diesel and WTI prices, which reduced fuel surcharge revenues compared to last year. Remaining decrease in revenue was due to a 23% decline in coal volume, driven by unseasonably warm weather and to the Triple Crown restructuring. Coal now represents less than 15% of our revenue, down from 29% in 2010. Excluding the impact of Triple Crown, our volumes are relatively flat despite the declining commodity markets. Due to our diverse portfolio and improved service product, revenue per unit less fuel increased year-over-year for the third quarter in a row as a result of our pricing focus, which more than offset the negative mix impact from increased intermodal volumes and declines in higher rated commodities. As you can see on slide eight, merchandise revenue increased 2% in the first quarter of 2016 with a 3% increase in volume. Volume grew in all business groups, except chemicals, which was impacted by decreased crude oil shipments. Automotive volume was up 18% in the quarter, exceeding North American vehicle production growth of 5% with relatively easy comparisons from last year. We do not anticipate year-over-year growth to continue at this level. Comparisons will become more difficult as the year progresses. For the year, we anticipate growth to be better aligned with North American vehicle production, which is now projected at an annual growth rate of 1.4%. Coil steel and plastics benefited from automotive production, while housing and construction activity drove growth in aggregates, cement and lumber. Turning to intermodal on slide nine. Overall volume was flat, notwithstanding the impact of the Triple Crown restructure. Excluding our Triple Crown subsidiary, intermodal volume increased 6% with a 15% increase in international business, resulting from our network reach and service. Domestic growth, excluding Triple Crown, was impacted by the inventory overhang that we discussed last quarter, though volumes improved sequentially each month as a result of service gains. Lower volumes of higher rated Triple Crown freight and lower fuel surcharge revenue decreased intermodal RPU by 12%. However, excluding the impact of Triple Crown and fuel surcharges, intermodal RPU increased 1% as pricing initiatives offset the negative mix associated with increased international volume and truck capacity. Moving to the coal market on slide 10, utility coal met our previous guidance of 15 million tons for the quarter, a decrease from last year due to warm weather and low natural gas prices. Exports slightly exceeded our guidance of 2.5 million tons to 3 million tons for the quarter, although challenges continue in an oversupplied global market. We maintain our previous export guidance through 2016. Excluding fuel, revenue per unit increased 3%; RPU was positively impacted by $10 million in liquidated damages in the first quarter, as rate increases were offset by unfavorable changes in the mix of business. As referenced on slide 11, warm weather in our service territory continued through March, resulting in stockpiles well above average levels. We expect this impact to extend into at least the fourth quarter and anticipate utility volumes continuing at the first quarter pace until stockpiles return to target levels, assuming normal weather patterns. Concluding with our outlook on slide 12, coal volumes in 2016 will be impacted as utilities work down the stockpile build-up resulting from the warm winter. Low oil and gas prices have significantly reduced rig counts and drilling activity, which will negatively impact our volume of crude by rail as well as natural gas drilling inputs, including frac sand and pipe. The Triple Crown restructure will dampen intermodal volume for the rest of the year. Longer term, our improved service product, combined with increased regulation in the trucking industry, provides stronger growth opportunities for domestic intermodal. Additionally, international intermodal volume benefits from our alignment with shipping partners adding capacity to the East Coast. Our pricing outlook is favorable, reflecting the value of our service product. While lower on-highway diesel and WTI prices and associated fuel surcharges continue to affect top line growth, that impact has greatly subsided. We focus on growth by providing a service product the market values, while negotiating market competitive prices. This quarter, our improved service levels, especially benefited intermodal and automotive and allowed Norfolk Southern to aggressively manage through the changing economic environment. While executing against our strategic plan, we are enhancing shareholder return by successfully operating a network that efficiently and fluidly handles a diverse portfolio of business, and strategically, inserting NS as a valued component of our customers' supply chains, which will generate greater opportunities for growth even as individual markets fluctuate. Next, Mike will describe operational improvements that have reduced our costs and enhanced the value of our products. Michael Joseph Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer : Thank you, Alan. I am pleased to announce that we are continuing to operate at high service levels, while also making significant strides in our cost reduction initiatives. Thanks to the commitment and focus of our employees on executing these key drivers of our strategic plan. The following results are a validation of NS employees' hard work. Let me begin with one of our core principles on slide 14, which is safety. While our injury ratio saw a slight uptick in the first quarter, as compared to the same period last year, we've actually seen a 5% improvement in our injury count. However, this was more than offset by a reduction in hours worked. We also achieved a reduction in the number of serious injuries resulting in an improvement in our serious injury ratio. Turning to service on slide 15. You can see we are maintaining the high service levels we delivered in the fourth quarter. We have achieved this while aggressively and successfully pursuing cost reduction initiatives, which is something we committed to on our last call. We remain confident we can continue to keep service at a high level, while we focus on identifying and implementing further cost reduction initiatives. As you can see on slide 16, our speed has continued to improve, which has aided our asset utilization. We are continuing to operate at our historic highs on this key metric. Dwell increased from the fourth quarter due in part to seasonal impact, but we were significantly below first quarter 2015. We are encouraged that our overall velocity as measured at the car level is near our previous record levels. Taking a look at our resources on slide 17, we continued right-sizing our workforce in the first quarter to match the business levels. These reductions occurred in all the operating departments. We had 1,300 T&E employees furloughed at the end of the quarter along with 450 non-T&E employees. We are in the process of recalling approximately 500 T&E employees to prepare for seasonal volume increases and to cover attrition, although for the full-year, we are ahead of our plan for head count reductions, which Marta will update you on later. On the locomotive side, aided by our high velocity and the execution of our strategic plan to run a more efficient and profitable railroad, we continue to rationalize our locomotive fleet. In addition to currently storing high-adhesion road locomotives, we have right-sized our yard and local fleet, a total of a 150 units have been removed from this fleet, representing a 12% reduction. We accomplished this without negatively impacting customer service levels. In addition, we plan to add 50 new locomotives in the second quarter, which will allow us to remove less efficient road locomotives from the fleet. Now, on slide 18, the cost reduction initiatives just discussed, coupled with our efforts to keep the railroad operating at a high level, have resulted in significant productivity savings. Through the first three months of the year, we've been able to realize significant improvements in key areas. Our 2.8% reduction in crew starts has outpaced our drop in volume, driven in part by our improvement in train length. That percentage is even higher when considering the sharp reduction in recrews, which along with the drop in overtime, is indicative of a very fluid railroad. All of these together are driving improved productivity as seen in the gross ton miles per T&E employee. So certainly some positive results. As Jim stated, this is indicative we are ahead of our $130 million productivity savings and now expect $200 million in productivity savings for the full-year. Some of this was frontend-loaded due to the benefit of not having last year's weather and service costs in the first quarter. On slide 19, I would like to update you on the status of our previously announced additional cost reduction initiatives. We have ceased road operations on the West Virginia Secondary, as well as completed the consolidation of the Pocahontas and Virginia divisions. We also continue to make progress with the idling of the Ashtabula coal terminal, which should be completed in the second quarter. As seen on slide 20, we've also consolidated our operational alignment from three regions to two. In addition to reducing regional supervision across all departments within operations, this initiative further streamlines our network and improves communication and coordination across the railroads. Lastly, on slide 21, we have also made significant progress with our yard rationalizations. We have been executing on this rationalization of our operation for several years, starting with the idling of Buckeye Yard in Columbus in 2009, continuing with Roanoke in 2013, and now Knoxville, Tennessee. As recently announced, we are idling terminal operations at our hump yard in Knoxville, effective May 1. 130 positions will be impacted by this reduction in operations. The annual savings on this initiative is approximately $13 million. Our ability to realize these savings is due in large part to our expansion at our Bellevue hump yard and the capacity that has given us. In addition, we have curtailed activities at many of our smaller yards. In all, we have reduced to rationalize yard operations at 25 locations across our system. We see a lot of positive signs from our operation and we will continue to execute our tactical and strategic cost control initiatives, and at the same time, ensure we continue to provide a great service product to our customers. Thank you. And I will now turn it over to Marta, who will update you on the financials. Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's take a look at our first quarter financials starting with operation. Slide 23 summarizes our operating results compared to last year's first quarter, and as Jim already mentioned, reflects a record-setting 70.1% operating ratio. As you know, the first quarter historically has the highest OR of the year and so this result is very supportive of our anticipated full-year operating ratio below 70%. Revenues, as Alan described, were down 6% in the quarter. However, this was offset by a larger decline of 13% or $264 million in expenses. The net result was an increase of $117 million or 19% in income from railway operation. Taking a look at slide 24, the 13% decline in operating expenses reflects the aggressive efforts our team is taking to reduce expenses and control costs. Every cost category, except for depreciation, declined in the quarter. Let's take a closer look at each of the components. Slide 25 depicts the significant drop in fuel costs. As you would expect, most of the decrease is price-related. In addition, consumption per unit improved as gallons of fuel use declined by 4% on the 2% reduction in traffic volume. Turning to slide 26. Compensation costs were down by $60 million or 8%. As Mike discussed, our efforts to minimize overtime and recrews combined with a lower overall head count resulted in $45 million of lower payroll. Commensurate with the reduced compensation base was the lower level of payroll taxes, which were down $13 million. Additionally, we lacked the $11 million in cost related to last year's signing bonus and had $10 million in lower pension expense. These items were partially offset by health and welfare rate increases of $15 million. As shown on the lower left of the slide, our average head count for the quarter declined by about 1,900 positions both for the year-over-year and the sequential comparison. As Mike described, some of this is seasonal and we now expect a full-year head count reduction of 1,500 versus the 1,200 from our previous forecast. Slide 27 details our materials and other category showing a decrease of $52 million or 21%. Reductions totaling $42 million were due to a decline in all areas of material usage : in locomotives, freight cars and roadway. The largest drop was in locomotive materials as a result of the 7% decline in locomotives and service. In addition to the decreased number of locomotive, we greatly reduced locomotive overhauls and strategically utilized parts from the fleet of DC locomotives that are slated for AC conversion. Additionally, fewer freight cars and the mild winter weather also contributed to lower material usage. For the remainder of the year, we expect the decline in materials to moderate to about a $10 million quarter-over-quarter favorable variance. Moving on to slide 28. Purchased services and rents were down $44 million or 10%, largely due to $34 million and lower Triple Crown costs associated with its much smaller operation. Additionally, expenses related to engineering and transportation services declined by $10 million and equipment rents were down $3 million, notwithstanding the strong automotive volumes as velocity-related benefits offset these volume metric effects. Turning to income taxes on slide 29. The effective rate for the first quarter was 35.5% versus 37.4% in 2015. A combination of small items including a state tax law change and corporate-owned life insurance proceeds slightly lowered the rate. For the remaining quarters of this year, we continue to expect a roughly 37% effective income tax rate. Slide 30 shows our bottom line results with net income of $387 million, reflecting an increase of $77 million or 25% and diluted earnings per share of $1.29, up 29%, compared with last year. We're making solid progress and remain committed to continued improvement. Wrapping up our financial overview on slide 31, cash from operations for the first three months was $879 million. Capital spending through the first quarter was approximately $400 million. Due to the reduction in traffic volume, we've re-visited our capital plan and have modestly reduced our full-year capital budget from $2.1 billion to $2 billion even. Turning back to cash flows, the improved operating cash and level CapEx resulted in free cash flow of almost $0.5 billion. With respect to shareholder returns, we repurchased $200 million of stock and paid $176 million in dividends during the quarter. And with that, I thank you for your attention and I'll turn the program back to Jim. James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Marta. Norfolk Southern has adapted to a challenging environment and delivered strong first quarter results. The NS team remains focused on executing our plan to reduce costs, drive profitability and enhance value for all NS shareholders. We're on the right track and showing tangible results. And with that, we will now open the line for Q&A. Operator? Operator : Thank you, Jim. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. And our first question comes from the line of Justin Long from Stephens. Please proceed with your question, sir. Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.: Thanks and congrats on the quarter. The first question I had was, I was wondering if you could provide any expectation for the sequential progression of the OR throughout the year. You mentioned in the prepared remarks that 1Q is usually the highest OR of the year. So I'm just curious if you think that typical seasonality will hold true in 2016? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : So, Justin, as you properly observed, the first quarter is traditionally the highest operating ratio quarter of the year. And so with our guidance for a sub-70% operating ratio for the full-year, we would expect to see declining operating ratios from here. And now with that said, we do certainly have some headwinds out there. The commodities landscape is anything but certain right now. And we're heading into some tough comps in the second quarter; some of the highest volume weeks of the year last year, and a variety of other areas as well. The revenue outlook is somewhat uncertain, but we are confident that we can deliver. We're pulling out all the stops on costs as you saw in the first quarter. And we intend to deliver a sub-70% operating ratio for the full-year. Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Great. And then, maybe as my follow-up on pricing, I know you don't give details on core price. But I was wondering first if you could talk about how much of your 2016 pricing is locked in as of today and then maybe just on a relative basis for that pricing that is locked in, how that stacks up to the level of increases you saw in 2015? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey, Justin, we've got about three-quarters of our business for 2016 locked up right now with pricing. And I would say at this point pricing is above the levels that we were seeing at this time last year. Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Great. I'll leave it at that. Thanks so much for the time. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Matt Troy from Nomura Asset Management. Please proceed with your question. Matt Troy - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my call. Just a quick one. I think a couple of quarters ago people had asked about your decision to maintain the WTI-based surcharges you've now said you're going to move in the last couple of quarters to on-highway diesel. Just wondering if you could frame for us roughly what percentage of your fuel surcharge programs are currently on the on-highway diesel framework and what's the opportunity over what timeframe to migrate that? Thanks. Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Matt, we've gotten our WTI-based revenue from a little bit over 50% to somewhere between 40% to 45% depending upon traffic mix. Matt Troy - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Okay. And my follow-up would then be just on the \u2013 a simple question on pension. You said it was lower by $10 million in the quarter, I'm wondering if you could just dimensionalize for the year is that at good run rate? Should we expect pension expense to be about $10 million lower per quarter? Or do you have an annual forecast there? Thanks. Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : Yes, Matt. You're correct. That pension trend that set for the first quarter will continue for each of the quarters the rest of the year. Matt Troy - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Great. Thanks, everybody. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Allison Landry from Credit Suisse Group. Please proceed with your question. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks. So thinking about the improved free cash flow here in the first quarter, is there upside potential to the $800 million of share buybacks you alluded to? And then, in terms of CapEx, you did take it down about $100 million, but do you see further opportunities to take that down even lower? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Allison, I'll start. We are certainly working hard to adjust our CapEx as appropriate to keep it within limits to generate satisfactory returns. And that's why we have modulated our capital spending both this year and last year downward in the face of declining revenue relative to our original expectations for the year. Marta, why don't you comment on the buybacks we've outlined today? Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : Okay. The buybacks are something that our board reviews continually. Each time we meet with our board, we look at that, we look at the free cash flow projection. And right now, we're comfortable with the guidance that we gave of $800 million for the full-year. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Thank you. Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : You're welcome. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter from Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question, sir. Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Jim and team, congrats on a great job. So stepping back from the active events around the M&A and you fought that back and a lot of weight on your shoulders to prove that you can achieve. So great job out of the gate now that you can just focus on actually running the business. But earlier, Michael, you talked about recrews down about 51%. Just wondering operationally, what are you changing in order to achieve that and what structurally when you take a step back? Obviously, you're shutting down a bunch of the different local networks that you've talked about and combining systems, but what operationally do you need to change? And is there more room to improve from those changes? Michael Joseph Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer : Yeah, Ken, well, obviously, like we talked about last year getting the right resources in place, crews and locomotives and those are in place. And with that, we've been executing our operating play very well. That's allowed us to reduce the recrews and do all the productivity things we've seen as well as all the high service levels we provided. So that's the big driver of it. We've got the resources, we've got the right operating plan and we're executing that operating plan. Now, going forward, we've always said that we're going to continue to take a look at what opportunities are out there. You saw what we've announced yesterday. We continue to look and we will, but we're always going to make sure that we protect the service products that we have and keep that at high levels, continue to reduce costs. Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Jim, when you step back, is there a master plan of different buckets that when you look at the 65% OR target that you can tell us and walk us through at some point, whether it's train lengths, what you need to do on sidings, reduction on employees or locomotives that you feel need to be done to get there? Or is this piecemeal each time you improve, you just keep coming out with, oh, we can close this now? Or is there something master that you can set targets on a little more specifically? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Sure. And we have outlined some targets along those lines, Ken, to go with the annual productivity savings, totaling more than $650 million by 2020. For example, we have said that we intend to bring employment down significantly with associated compensation benefits expense savings by 2020. And that's a function of productivity \u2013 labor productivity initiatives across the board. We also have targets for our locomotive fleet and for various other resources that will drive those productivity savings. Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Is that something you're going to share with us, kind of, targets and goals, so we can watch you along the way? Or are they just more internal target? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : We'll certainly update you as we move along. As we have today with regard to our labor targets and Mike also got into the locomotive fleet size and efforts there to rationalize that asset. Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Great job. Thank you for the time. Operator : Now our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee from Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. Wanted to ask you about the productivity, the $200 million upsides from $130 million. Can you give a sense of how much was in the first quarter? It sounded like maybe some of it was a little bit pulled forward due to weather and some other favorable operating conditions. But just wanted to get a sense as to what was in 1Q and then maybe how we think about the cadence for the rest of the year? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. That's right, Chris. We entered the year with a running start, and we had some built-in favorability from the absence of weather and service-related spending in the first quarter of last year. And that boosted productivity in the first quarter. We were also benefiting from other initiatives that we kicked off last year that gave us a lot of momentum and energy entering 2016. And we're going to keep that going. We've revised upward as we've said the productivity target for the full-year to $200 million. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): So just trying to understand how much that $200 million might have been in 1Q and then what we can expect for the rest of the year? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : $200 million for the full-year is our new goal as I said. Again, that was bit front-loaded (36:48) in the first quarter and Marta went through, for example, the run rate on mechanical spending relative to last year will lessen somewhat in subsequent quarters. So, call it, fast start. We're going to stay at it, and for the full-year, $200 million. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. That's helpful. And then, just thinking about the head count as we go forward, obviously, you updated the target there. That would suggest roughly flattish maybe a little bit down \u2013 or maybe a little bit up a little bit over the course of the rest of the year. Just want to think is that right way to think about how that cadence plays out, see a (37:23) seasonal uptick generally in volume over the next couple of quarters, but found that you can handle that with the existing resources you have? Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : So our guidance, Chris, was that for the full-year, we think we will be down 1,500. So I don't know if you're looking at it sequentially or year-over-year, but the way you think about it is, if you look at our last year average that we have in our financial data book, we think we're going to end the year 1,500 below that. Makes sense? Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. That's helpful. Appreciate it. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey, thanks. Afternoon, guys. So outside of the \u2013 about $10 million or so of liquidated damages, is there anything else that you would call unusual in this quarter? And I guess, I'm trying to go back to that first question about the sequential margin trend because we typically see \u2013 I don't know \u2013 400 basis points or 500 basis points in margin improvement from 1Q to 2Q, and I don't know if that's a realistic expectation given the strength we saw in the first quarter. Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : Well, Scott, let me reference you to something that Jim said about the weather-related. If you recall last year, we had some weather and service-related costs in each of the first three quarters, but they were definitely weighted towards the first quarter. So that was $42 million that we called out last year. So that's the running start that he and Mike referred to. So that would tell you that we had more of a reduction in the first quarter than you would normally expect. That makes sense with the $42 million of the $82 million was incurred in the first quarter of last year. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. So maybe we've got $40-so-million of lower-than-normal weather costs and then a little bit of a liquidated damages to think about for the first quarter of this year. Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : That's right. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : And the third item would be the materials that we highlighted that we had a materials year-over-year reduction of $42 million in this first quarter, but we forecast that will be just a $10 million reduction in the second, third and fourth quarters. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : What's the change there? Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : That's the materials. We had some items in the first quarter that that I called out in terms of locomotive overhauls that were greatly reduced and some specific things we did with freight cars and locomotives in terms of using parts that is a first quarter-only item. So part of the materials reduction will continue, but a large part that we had in the first quarter will not. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And then, just in terms of head count, so you're already above the 1,500 people you're talking about for the year. And we're not really seeing the seasonal volume uptick, your service metrics are at great levels right now, and then, you just announced some additional closures yesterday or two days ago. So, I guess, I'm a little confused why we're not raising the head count target even more? Michael Joseph Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer : Well, we do need to bring the folks back to cover attritions and we need those folks to make sure we continue to maintain the service levels that we have. That's a key point. And we historically do see higher seasonal volumes in the second quarter and third quarter than what we have in the first quarter. And that's expected to cover that as well. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : What are you assuming for volumes in the second quarter? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Well, we expect sequentially higher volumes in line with the usual seasonal pattern. Alan, why don't you break that down a little bit for Scott? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Scott, it will be down year-over-year, though, because, as Jim noted, some of our greatest volume comps were in the second quarter of last year. We're going to continue to have headwinds in our coal market, which I've outlined. We will not have the level of growth in our automotive franchise that we had in the first quarter due to the fact that we had some pretty easy comps in the first quarter of last year. And there are a couple of models that are built at plants served by NS, which are effectively being taken offline due to low demand. So we are going to have some headwinds with respect to volume in the second quarter. But ultimately, service is driving more intermodal volumes for us. And Triple Crown will be a headwind for us into the fourth quarter of this year. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Thank you, guys. Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : You're welcome. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl from Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question. Jason H. Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC: Yeah. Thank you, operator. Hey, guys. The old saying, you got to walk before you run, and it looks like at least you guys are starting to jog. Just a question, sort of your physical plan going forward, I know as one of the callers alluded to before that you guys made some recent streamlining announcements. What in terms of maybe some track sales or maybe some track divestitures might be left here in 2016 and when should we expect more color on them? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : We have previously announced a goal of short-lining, idling, or downgrading a 1,000 miles of track this year. That remains our goal in terms of the track structure. Mike, other thoughts on infrastructure-related right-sizing? Michael Joseph Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer : We continue to look at it. We've got a lot of modeling that goes on to try and find where we can that and we take the opportunities. We will do that. We have some of those things you're talking about on the table going forward that will be announced later on in the year. Jason H. Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay. That's fair enough. Also, how should we think about coal next year? I know it's very negative now and all the other railroads are talking about massively high stockpiles, warmest winter on record. How should we look at it next year if we get more normalized weather patterns? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Jason, if stockpiles return to target by the end of the year, then coal volumes will be close to where we were at a run rate last year, where we in our utility markets we were 17 million, 19 million tons is what we were looking at, and export's going to be highly depended upon what happens with the overseas market. Jason H. Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC: Right. I understand that. So where are we now with stockpiles in your region? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Jason, they're about 100 days right now. And target I would tell you is probably about 60 days depended upon the geography. So there is a lot of inventory overhang that needs to get worked through this summer in order for us to get back to target. So we're going to need a hot summer to support that coal franchise. Jason H. Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC: I'll keep my fingers crossed for you. Well, listen, guys, I appreciate the time as always. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, good afternoon, everyone. And thanks for taking the question. And, Jim, if you guys keep delivering, earnings up 29%, some of those critical stuff, I think, in past three months probably goes away pretty quickly. I just want to ask you, Marta, because you grouped in materials and other and I think purchased services and some other line items. So can you go over the guidance for those two broad categories again as they're supposed to trend throughout the year. Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : Okay, certainly. So in materials, we were down $42 million in the first quarter, but quarter-over-quarter for the remainder of the year, we think that's going to be down $10 million, okay. And then in purchased services... Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Sorry, Marta, I just want to clarify. So sequentially down $10 million or, meaning, year-over-year? Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : Quarter-over-quarter. Year-over-year. So second quarter of 2016 compared to second quarter of 2015 and so on, we think that will be down $10 million in materials. And then, with purchased services and rents, the predominant reason for the reduction there was the reduction in Triple Crown services. So that was $34 million of that decline. And that will continue at that level for the \u2013 at approximately that level for the second quarter and third quarter. In the fourth quarter, it will be about half of that because recall that we downsized Triple Crown in the middle of the fourth quarter of last year. Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Got it. That's helpful. Thank you for clarifying. I guess, let me just slip one more question, if you guys don't mind. So, Jim, what can you leverage on the service side now that it appears you have your cost structure a little bit better than where it was last year. Service does appear to be improving for Norfolk. When markets come back, what's the plan on the marketing cycles? We've talked a lot here about the cost side. James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Sure, absolutely. We are well-positioned to grow as commodities rebound and other markets recover from inventory overhang. And that's the great benefit of having service at the current level. It sheds cost and it positions us for growth. So we are very confident that we can grow into this level of service and will just as soon as business picks up. Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Rob Salmon from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, good afternoon, guys. Marta, with the benefits from the Knoxville closing, it sounded like, if I heard you correct, it's about $13 million on an annualized basis. Are there any costs that we should be thinking about in terms of that will be incurred in Q2 in anticipation of the savings that we should be modeling in? Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : No. No. You're good with that $13 million that Mike talked about. Again, it is going to be effective May 1 and the $13 million is annualized. So roughly, half of that we'll realize this year with mid-year implementation. Michael Joseph Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer : Correct. Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Right. That's helpful. And then, with regard to the train length, I saw that increased about 2.5% on a year-over-year basis. Is that predominantly driven by the growth that we saw in terms of traffic in your merchandise network? Or was this more broad-based and that's not a fair apples-to-apples comparison? Michael Joseph Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer : No, you're exactly right. Our intermodal and the unit trains stayed at very highly levels. But the growth was in the merchandise section. In fact, that section grew 6%. Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And how should we think about the cadence looking out from here? Are there incremental initiatives that should allow further growth? Or is the growth going to come from volume eventually picking up? Michael Joseph Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer : I would say both. We'll be able to handle the volume growth on to the train network. The other thing is we continue to have initiatives looking at where we can build big trains particularly between terminal and terminal, including more use of the distributed power technology. And we're doing more and more of that. And big trains terminal-to-terminal where it makes sense. Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And are there any goals that you're willing to share in terms of targets for the back-half of the year at this point? Michael Joseph Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer : No, not at this time. Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks for the time. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of David Vernon from Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Just a question for you on some of the intermodal pricing and the outlook for intermodal rates both in the near term, it looks like the RPU ex-Triple Crown and fuel surcharge grew at about a percent. And I'm just wondering what your expectation is in the context of that pricing above inflation what we should be expecting in that core intermodal rate? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Well, David, recognize that that 1% growth had a negative mix component from flat domestic and a 15% increase in international, which tends to be a shorter haul that have a lower RPU, 40-foot (50:13). So I'll strip that mix and we had pricing in intermodal that exceeded rail inflation and pricing in intermodal that drives sufficient shareholder returns to allow it to compete for capital. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: So you're not seeing any pressure there from any temporary looseness in the truck market on the intermodal rates? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : To be sure, truck capacity is limiting probably the level of increase that we could get, but it's not causing rate decreases. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. And then, maybe just as a quick follow-up. Obviously, Jim, this is a pretty amazing inflection point in sequential productivity. And I guess, as you think about the outlook obviously, you're going to be delivering more, but should we be thinking this first quarter is the \u2013 like you said, a running start and is there is going to be the peak for the rate of change in productivity going forward or are you also holding some things back for later in the year? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Yes. No, I think that's a fair assumption. We front-loaded some of the productivity gains. As I said, we had a very fast start to the year with a lot of momentum and energy based on the plans that we made and the things that we did last year to position ourselves for it. So, yes, we have the pedal to the metal. And that's where it's going to stay. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: All right. Well, a 70% OR in the first quarter is truly impressive. And great results, guys. Thanks. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz from UBS. Please proceed with your question. Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah. Good afternoon. And I echo the other comments, very strong results obviously. Let's see. Can you comment a little on the look on markets where \u2013 I know you said that the second quarter comps are more difficult volume-wise. But as you look at things, I guess, macro variables changing and so forth, where might you be most optimistic that you could see some improvement in markets? Would it be in steel with some of the actions that might take place that might help the domestic producers? Where might you actually see a little more optimism looking beyond maybe the tough comps here in the near term? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Tom, we've talked about the coil steel, benefiting from the automotive market. As you alluded to, the recent tariff activity has improved steel pricing and steel capacity utilization. So there are some aspects of the steel market that are performing well within our metals and construction, of course, is frac sands. And we're going to have a pretty significant decline there due to the decline in drilling activity as is pipe. I would tell you that once the retail and wholesale inventory levels normalize, we see a lot of opportunity in that consumer-based market because of our improved service product. And even with pressure on corporate profits now, shippers are looking to shift to intermodal because it still is a lower priced option than truck. Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : So what's the reasonable timeframe to see the volumes look a little bit better? You think they can grow later in the year? Or is that just hard to tell? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : It's going to be wholly dependent upon what happens with commodity pricing, the pressures in crude oil, frac sand and coal, and then, what happens with the retail and wholesale inventory levels. Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And then just a short follow-up. On the comp and benefits, can you give me any sense of how to model that year-over-year looking forward, Marta? Does that change because incentive comp is more of a headwind or different? Or do you think it's down for year-over-year the next several quarters? Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : Yes, I think you keyed on the one thing that's going to be different in the second through fourth quarters. In my prepared remarks, I talked about three things and they're going to continue. Just to summarize those that head count is going to continue, but at a moderated levels we've already discussed. The inflation that we had guided to at 3.5% and you saw the $15 million in health and welfare, that's going to continue. The pension, as someone else asked a few minutes ago, that's going to continue. But the one thing that is going to be different in the second, third and fourth quarters is the year-over-year headwind from incentive comp. Because, as you'll recall, last year in the first quarter, we had been accruing at a beginning of the year bonus accrual level, but as the year went along and we didn't meet expectations, we had reversals of those accruals, and so each of the quarter's last year had year-over-year incentive comp reductions. And so depending on how our performance is, the remainder of the year you will see headwinds from that item Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you for the time. Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : You're welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Brown from Raymond James. Please proceed with your question. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, good afternoon. Hey, Jim, I just wanted to ask you a little bit about the opening of the Bellevue hump yard and the Englewood flyover from last year. So first, are you guys seeing the returns on those projects that you expected? And then, two, I'm just curious if those projects have been instrumental in the ability to close Roanoke and Knoxville hump yards, even if they've been a key driver on productivity. James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : No doubt about it. The Bellevue capacity and throughput has facilitated asset rationalization elsewhere on the network, including at the terminal level and elsewhere as well and certainly the other flyover has helped with our meets in and out of Chicago. So yes to both. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, great. And then, I am curious, at this point, has rationalizations impacted schedules or transit times at all on the intermodal side maybe positively or negatively? Michael Joseph Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer : No, no. We are continuing to run at the high levels that we've had in the past, so it's all been good. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, great. Great quarter. Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ben Hartford from Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. Ben J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah, thanks. Marta, can I circle back on the incentive comp discussion? Did you provide what the headwind was in the first quarter, if there was any in terms of IC? Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : It was approximately flat in the first quarter. If you do look at the full-year of last year, it was a year-over-year $150 million, but it was all in the second, third and fourth quarters. Ben J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. So will there be catch-up in 2Q, 3Q, 4Q from the first quarter? Or was there just none for some reason even though \u2013 despite the quarter strength? Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : It's more of a year-over-year thing, Ben. So the first quarter of last year, we had an incentive comp accrual and then this first quarter of this year, we had a roughly similar amount. As you move into the remainder of the year, the issue will be the year-over-year comparison. Ben J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Got it. Alan, I guess, maybe your view on international intermodal and SOLAS and the container weighting discussion, what is your take in terms of potential pull-forward of international intermodal ahead of the implementation midyear and what type of effect do you expect if and when that is implemented? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Ben, we've heard the theory that that could cause some volumes to be pulled forward. But as we've talked to our customers in the shipping lines, we haven't seen any activity to that regard. Ben J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): I assume there are concerns, but any changes in behavior that you see from shippers preparing for that potential implementation? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : No, nothing meaningful. Ben J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks. James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : All right. Thank you very much for your participation in today's call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. We thank you for your time and participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful rest of your day.",

Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc. Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc. Operator : Greetings, and welcome to the Norfolk Southern Corporation Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Katie Cook, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Katie U. Cook - Director- Investor Relations : Thank you, Christine, and good morning. Before we begin today's call, I would like to mention a few items. The slides of the presenters are available on our website at norfolksouthern.com in the Investor section, along with our non-GAAP reconciliations. Additionally, transcripts and downloads of today's call will be posted on our website. During this call, we may make certain forward-looking statements which are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and may differ materially from our actual results. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. Now it is my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's Chairman, President, and CEO, Jim Squires. James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Katie, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to Norfolk Southern's second quarter 2016 earnings call. With me today are NS's Chief Marketing Officer, Alan Shaw; our Chief Operating Officer, Mike Wheeler; and our Chief Financial Officer, Marta Stewart. Our results this quarter, as shown on slide four, underscore the flexibility built into our team's planning and execution. Volumes came in below expectations, so we quickly reigned in costs, pushing operating expenses down 11% in the face of a 10% decline in revenue. As a result, we posted a 68.6% operating ratio, 140 basis points or 2% below last year. Earnings per share for the quarter were $1.36, just 4% lower than last year's $1.41. For the first six months of 2016, our 69.4% operating ratio set a record, while EPS increased 10% year-over-year. These results reflect an unwavering focus on cost control and steadfast commitment to customer service. Thus, even as we aggressively reduced spending, we drove significant improvements in network performance, as shown by the 13% uptick in the composite service metric in the quarter, an 18% increase in the first half. Turning to slide five, even in the current challenging environment, we believe we can achieve at least $200 million of productivity savings for the full year, and an operating ratio below 70%. Longer-term, we will continue positioning for topline growth while targeting annual productivity savings of over $650 million by 2020 and an operating ratio below 65%. Given our strong start this year, we are well on our way. Now, Alan will cover trends in revenue; Mike will provide more detail on how we're managing the operations; and Marta will summarize our financial results. Then we'll take your questions. But before I turn over the microphone, let me add a word of thanks to all our employees. Your intelligence and hard work are the keys to our success. Thank you. And now I'll turn the program over to Alan and then return to take your questions. Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, Jim, and good morning to our audience. We appreciate your joining us today. Norfolk Southern continues to face economic headwinds, especially in regard to energy prices. Declining coal shipments and fuel surcharge revenue, coupled with the Triple Crown restructuring and reduced crude oil volume, lowered top line in the second quarter. Excluding Triple Crown and fuel surcharges, intermodal revenue increased slightly year-over-year. In addition to decreased fuel surcharges, the mix associated with lower coal volume and increased intermodal reduced our second-quarter revenue per unit, despite accelerated pricing growth in the quarter. Within our merchandise market as shown on slide eight increased shipments of cement and steel benefited our metals and construction volume. While second-quarter and expected full-year automotive volume growth is in line with North American vehicle production, second-half volumes will be influenced by competitive losses and plant-specific outages associated with decreased model demand, limiting year-over-year comparisons. Chemicals market declines were driven by crude oil and by plant closures and consolidations that reduced industrial intermediates traffic. Our agriculture markets were impacted by increased competition from local corn moving via truck and weaker feed exports. Merchandise ARPU, excluding fuel, increased 2% due to positive pricing despite the negative mix associated with decreased industrial intermediates and frac sand. As reflected on slide nine, international intermodal growth of 4% partially offset losses in both domestic and Triple Crown freight. Our alignment with the ports and shipping lines, adding capacity for growth, will benefit the international segment over the long term. Intermodal continues to be impacted by excess capacity in the truck market, a condition we expect to change next year. Lastly, the Triple Crown restructure will affect our year-over-year volume comparisons until midway through the fourth quarter. Excluding Triple Crown and fuel surcharges, intermodal posted an increase of 1% in revenue, volume, and RPU. RPU benefited from strong pricing, despite the adverse mix associated with increased international freight. Moving on to coal on slide 10, coal volumes declined as a result of sustained low natural gas prices, high stockpiles, and continued weak export conditions. RPU excluding fuel remained flat, with positive pricing neutralized by mix, increased volumes of thermal export coal and declines of metallurgical export coal lowered RPU, which was further affected by volume declines in certain long-haul utility lanes. Current weather conditions and natural gas prices are offering some support for the more efficient coal plants. However, we still have a significant utility stockpile overhang through which to work before volumes normalize. On slide 11, continued mild weather early in the second quarter limited utility shipments and increased the stockpile overhang. Reported May stockpiles were at the highest point over the past few years. Although there was some improvement in June, it is expected that this inventory overhang will linger into 2017. With normal weather patterns, we expect to handle between 13 million and 15 million tons of utility coal per quarter until stockpiles reach target. However, recent hot weather and higher natural gas prices may push that upper boundary into third quarter. Continuing with our outlook on slide 12, continuing economic challenges dampen our volume expectations for the third quarter, although we expect volume to slightly improve sequentially as compared to the second quarter. In the fourth quarter, we will have somewhat easier comparisons to last year, during which volumes were impacted by the Triple Crown restructuring, warm weather, commodity price declines, and higher inventories. These factors, plus positive volume trends in construction-related steel, agriculture, and intermodal markets, point to a modest increase in fourth-quarter volume. Our 2016 pricing remains strong overall, though we do see some softness in truck-competitive sectors. We continue to focus on maintaining a service product that the market values, commanding a higher price and attracting service-sensitive business. Lastly, as we monitor market conditions and changing volume expectations we will control all aspects of our business impacted by these shifts. Marketing is collaborating closely with operating and finance departments to correctly align our resources with current volume trends. To further discuss our operations, I will now turn it over to Mike. Michael Joseph Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer : Thank you Alan. I am pleased to announce we are continuing to operate at high service levels while achieving significant results in our cost-reduction initiatives. As Jim noted, thanks to the commitment and focus of our employees on executing these key drivers of our strategic plan. The following results are due to NS employees' hard work. Let me begin with safety on slide 14. While our reportable injury ratio increased in the second quarter as compared to the same period last year we have seen an improvement sequentially this year, which is encouraging. We also maintained a low serious injury ratio. Turning to service on slide 15, you see we further improved our already high service levels from the first quarter. This marks the sixth consecutive quarter of improved service to our customers. For the second quarter, our service composite improved 13%, which was driven by a 32% improvement in train performance and an 11% improvement in shipments making (10:58) connection. So it is good to see all components of the service composite improving. What is equally encouraging is we have maintained and achieved this while aggressively and successfully pursuing cost-reduction initiatives as supported by our 68.6% operating ratio. We remain confident we can continue to keep service at a high level while we focus on continuing to identify and implement further cost reduction initiatives. As you can see on slide 16, our train speed and terminal dwell improved 12% and 9% respectively compared to the same period last year. Overall velocity, as measured at the car level remains near our record levels and continues to aid our asset utilization and improve service for our customers. This has been a driver in being able to store 450 locomotives. We are also very pleased to see our service and velocity metrics remain very high even with the idling of Knoxville, a major hump terminal, on May 1st. Now on slide 17, our ability to keep the railroad operating at a high level while implementing aggressive cost-cutting initiatives resulted in significant productivity savings. Our reduction in crew starts was in line with our drop in volume, and we have continued to improve our train length, re-crews, and overtime. Together, this resulted in improved employee productivity. Also, our T&E head count was down 9%, which helped drive the reduction in our overall corporate head count. I will now turn it over to Marta, who will highlight the effect of these improvements. Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Let's take a look at the second quarter financials. Slide 19 summarizes the operating results and highlights the expense control focus that Jim discussed. While revenues declined by 10% on the 7% lower volume, our operating expenses were down 11%. This led to a much-improved operating ratio of 68.6%. The next slide shows the expense reductions by category. As was the case in the first quarter, all categories except for depreciation were lower. Depreciation was up 4%, reflecting continued investment in our capital assets. Now let's take a closer look at each of the other components. Slide 21 depicts the drop in fuel expense, totaling $81 million or 32% for the quarter. Lower oil prices resulted in a 25% decrease in the price per gallon, while consumption fell by 6%. Turning to slide 22, compensation costs were down by $57 million or 8%. As shown on the lower left of the slide, our average head count for the quarter declined by about 2,000 employees versus last year and was flat sequentially. Since we did not see the normal historical rise in volumes from the first to the second quarter, we were able to hold employment levels lower than previously expected. This reduced head count, along with lower overtime and fewer re-crews, resulted in $50 million of year-over-year savings. The associated payroll taxes were favorable by $11 million, and we had $9 million in lower pension expense. These items were partially offset by $14 million in health and welfare rate increases associated with our agreement workforce. For the remainder of the year, we expect head count to remain relatively flat. But we will face about a $30 million per-quarter headwind for incentive comp, since last year's third and fourth quarters included reversals of accruals. Of course, both of these expectations are based on our current volume projection. Purchased services and rent is depicted on slide 23 and was down $54 million or 12%. Lower costs associated with the curtailed Triple Crown operations accounted for $38 million of the reduction, and expenses related to joint facilities and haulage declined by $8 million. Slide 24 details our materials and other category, reflecting a decrease of $33 million or 14%. Reductions totaling $26 million were due to declines in materials usage for locomotives, freight cars, and roadway, with the largest drop related to locomotives as a result of the fewer units in service that Mike mentioned. For the remainder of the year, we continue to expect favorability in materials costs, but at a somewhat moderated level of about $15 million per quarter compared with the third and fourth quarters of last year. Next, taking a look at non-operating income on slide 25, we had a large relative decrease of $15 million in this category, which was primarily related to three items : reduced income associated with our leased coal properties, fewer gains on property sales, and costs for external advisors. Moving on to income taxes on slide 26, the effective rate for the second quarter was 36.3% versus 38.1% last year. The lower effective rate reflects a combination of small items including corporate-owned life insurance, tax credits, and state tax law change. For the full year, we continue to expect an effective income tax rate of roughly 37%. Slide 27 shows our bottom-line results, with net income of $405 million, a decrease of 6% versus 2015, and diluted earnings per share of $1.36, down 4% compared with last year. Wrapping up our financial overview on slide 28, cash from operations for the first six months was $1.4 billion, covering capital spending and producing $500 million in free cash flow. With respect to shareholder returns, we paid $350 million in dividends and repurchased $400 million of our shares. Going forward and in light of the still-soft volumes, we have trimmed capital spending for the full year by another $100 million, and now project $1.9 billion in total CapEx for the year. We remain on track for full-year share repurchases of $800 million. Thank you for your attention, and I'll turn the program back to Jim. James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Marta, and we'll now take your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question and answer session. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great; good morning. Alan, you mentioned a lot of core pricing going up or even flat in some categories. Can you give us \u2013 it sounds like though, some competition pressuring some of the volumes in different instances as well. Can you talk about overall your thoughts on pricing, given what's going on in the truck market, going what's given on in different commodities on an aggregate basis? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, Ken, good morning. Pricing is still moving up for us. We accelerated pricing year-over-year. We are facing some competition with respect to truck. Doesn't mean we're taking lower prices; it more, Ken, limits our upside potential in certain truck-competitive markets. Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I'm sorry, just \u2013 so in aggregate, still kind of above inflation? I mean, can you give a parameter of how in aggregate you're thinking about pricing overall? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. We are taking a measured and disciplined approach to pricing. We're focused on competitive pricing above rail inflation. We continue to exceed that, and we are exceeding the pricing levels that we achieved last year. Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, wonderful. And then a follow-up on a different subject. But just looking, Jim, talking about your long-term double-digit growth and sub 65% target. Great to see the progress with the $200 million. When you think about the $650 million, to get to that scale, is that new programs? Is that shutting additional yards? You mentioned one of the hump yards you shut down. Can you kind of give \u2013 maybe some parameters on other \u2013 as you've moved along in this development, your thoughts on how you're going to get there? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Sure. What we've previously outlined a goal of $650 million in annual productivity savings by 2020, and we are making good progress on that thus far. We're only six months into a five-year plan, so we still have a lot of ground to cover. But the big buckets of that $650 million, as you know, are in comp and benefits, fuel consumption, locomotive maintenance, and reduced equipment costs and fees. And we're making progress in all of those areas. We have plans in place to continue pushing productivity gains for the remainder of this year and a five-year plan period. Kenneth Scott Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks for the time this morning. Appreciate the insight. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : Yes, good morning. I wanted to ask you a little bit about how we might think about operating ratio in the second half. It sounds like you're having a little more constructive outlook for volumes, that there could be some improvement. I know you've got good operating leverage in your scheduled carload network, and presumably in intermodal as well. So I'm just wondering. I think you talked about some costs pressures from incentive comp and so forth. How would you think about operating ratio in second half, and maybe the impact of operating leverage if volume improved relative to what might be happening on the cost side? Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : Yes, Tom, thank you. Good morning. We still are guiding towards the below-70% operating ratio for the full year. You are correct that we had good movement on that in the second quarter. For the remainder of the year, the two items that I will point out \u2013 you mentioned one of them \u2013 that will cause the 68.4% to maybe go up a little bit but still stay below 70%, is the incentive comp and then also the rate of decline in the materials expenses. But we're comfortable with our, continuing our guidance of below-70% for the full year. Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : And how do you think about volumes? Like, I mean, I guess if we see volumes develop a little bit better and you do see kind of less-worse third quarter and then improvement year-over-year in fourth quarter, is it fair to think that there'll be nice impact in terms of operating leverage and nice impact to the OR? Or should we be kind of cautious on how we anticipate that coming through? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Certainly volume growth represents upside. Volume growth beyond our expectations would represent upside, particularly if it occurs in lines of business with high operating leverage. So, yes, that's certainly a possibility. We believe we have the capacity to take advantage of natural operating leverage in those businesses. Now I'll turn it over to Alan to talk a little bit more about the volume outlook generally in the second half. Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Tom, I spoke a little bit about it in the remarks as I walked through our different commodities. For us, it's going to be a coal and intermodal outlook, and merchandise ups and downs are going to be dependent upon energy prices. If you take a look at the forward curve for commodities and energy prices, the fourth quarter is higher than it stands today, although I'll note that just this month WTI has pulled back 12%. So that creates some caution to our outlook. But generally, we see that sequential growth in the third quarter. Fourth-quarter comps should be much easier for us, because fourth quarter last year is when we saw the commodities downdraft and we saw the Triple Crown restructuring towards the middle of the quarter. Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : Right. Okay; great. Thanks for the time. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I just want to clarify a response to a previous question on pricing. Did you say that your year-on-year pricing is actually above what it was last year? Or just that you're getting higher price versus last year? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Ravi, I did say that our year-on-year pricing is higher than it stood at this point last year. We are taking a long-term approach, as are our customers. There is an expectation that the trucking market is going to tighten at some point next year. And we've started to see some sequential improvement in demand in the truck market just this month. And we're leveraging the benefit of our improved service product. Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, got it. And not that anyone knows what the weather will do, but does your 4Q volume growth forecast assume a normal winter or a warm winter, just given that we're having record heat this year? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : We are assuming normal weather patterns. And certainly weather and natural gas prices will determine how quickly stockpiles return to normal within the coal network. In any case, we don't believe that that will occur until sometime next year. Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Good morning. Thanks. I just wanted to follow up on the OR commentary for the back half. I just want to make sure I understand it correctly. So potentially a little bit worse sequentially in Q3, but then maybe with volume growth in Q4, the normal sequential deterioration that you'd see in the OR then; maybe the cadence is off. Is that the right way to think about it? Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : I think the right direction, I think you're right, Allison. I think the right way to think about it is, it's very dependent on the volumes that come. So you all are familiar with our incremental margin hierarchy, which is when the volumes come back in merchandise that is the most positive incrementally and then coal and then intermodal, because of the specific costs that it has. So it's very dependent on the volume. You're not going to see a very \u2013 you're not going to see a huge change in any of these items. I guided to the two specific items in expense going forward that will be slightly different in the third quarter and fourth quarters. But as Mike and the operating team continue to run the railroad very, very efficiently, you're mostly going to see a continuation operating expense-wise of what you saw in the second quarter. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, that's helpful, thanks. And, then thinking about CapEx and maybe if you could provide any initial thoughts on spending for 2017, considering what will likely be two consecutive down years for GTMs and then the percentage of the locomotive fleet that's in storage. James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Sure, I'll take that one, Allison. So we have previously guided to CapEx at 19% of revenue through the completion of PTC. Thereafter, we expect to be able to reduce CapEx by several percentage points relative to sales. And we've been aggressive this year on CapEx in light of volumes, revenue and cash flow that have not met initial expectations. We've reduced CapEx as Marta mentioned, fully $200 million relative to our original plan. And that's important because we're focused on making the investments we need to make. We will invest as required to operate safely, efficiently and provide a high level service product. Beyond that, it's all about the returns. If they are there, we'll invest more; if they are not, we won't. We recognize the need to generate ample free cash flow for shareholders and that's all part of our strategy. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Then maybe just a follow-up on that. So, Marta, I think you had mentioned at some of the conferences in the last few months that you guys are still expecting to acquire, I think another 50 new locomotive units next year. Is that still the way that you guys are thinking about it? Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : That's correct. We have 50 new locomotives coming in next year. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, great. Thank you for the time. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great, thanks good morning. Just wanted to follow-up on that CapEx question and just sort of just conceptually thinking about maybe the cadence of volume growth as you look out over the course of the next year or so and the progress of locomotive that you need to take on. I guess maybe the question comes up of why wouldn't we maybe see CapEx fall a little bit before PTC spending goes down? You do have lower incremental spending on equipment coming. I just want to make sure I get all of the moving parts when think about that, maybe for 2017 and 2018? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : I'd like to turn it over to Mike to talk about our locomotive strategy in particular. Since that's obviously a significant capital budget item. To reiterate what I said a minute ago, we will invest as necessary to provide a safe, efficient, high-service product. After that we'll see. It just depends on the returns on the incremental dollar of investment. What I would love for investors to take away from this call is our commitment to disciplined capital spending in the here and now. And as noted, we've tightened the reins on capital spending this year just as we have on expense to reflect lower than expected revenue and cash flow. And, that's really important in our business. It's an asset-intensive business; we've got to stay disciplined on CapEx as with expenses and that's part of our plan to drive free cash flow. Mike, why don't you talk a little bit about the locomotive strategy specifically? Michael Joseph Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer : Yes. Well, we still do have the 50 locomotives new next year. We continue to progress down the really innovative DC-to-AC rebuild strategy that we have in place, which over the next several years will allow us to bring the age of our fleet down and get good locomotives at a much lower capital cost than new. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay, that's helpful. So it's productivity as well. That makes sense. Can I ask a question, just a follow-up on productivity, the $200 million or better I think for this year? Can you give us a sense of maybe how that might be portioned out into the back half of the year? Maybe where you are and how we should be thinking about for 3Q and 4Q. James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : So we've outlined an annual productivity objective, and that's where we're going to stay in terms of our productivity goals. We have seen significant progress in productivity in the first half; obviously you see that in the numbers. We've said that we continue to believe we can do $200 million or better for the full year. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. So thinking about it, roughly, equal? Or any sense of what the progress has been toward that goal this year? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : We did say in the first quarter that we frontloaded some of the productivity. You saw that in the first quarter. And we continued on track during the second quarter. For the full year, we're still thinking we can do at least $200 million. Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : Right. And generally speaking, the front-end loading that Jim described is in the materials area. And, so the detail that we gave with regard to the $42 million materials reduction in the first quarter and then $26 million this quarter, you can see that front-end loading there because we expect $15 million going forward. So if you look at that difference, that's the area where we had the front-end loading. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. That's perfect. Thank you very much for the time; I appreciate it. Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : You're welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question. Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Yeah. Thanks for taking my question here. The STB has promised a decision on the NIT League's competitive switching proposal by the end of this month, which is just a few days away. I was hoping you could shed some light on what your expectations are to both the timing and the content of that, when we receive it, based on your engagement with the agency. James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : The STB had publicized a schedule for issuing rulings in that case and several others earlier this year. My understanding is that's not a deadline; it's not binding on the STB. It's their current expectation as to when they'll issue rulings. So I don't have any further insight to shed on the timeline or what may come from the STB. We have certainly made our case for the status quo when it comes to competition in the industry, and we'll just have to wait and see how the STB rules there and in the other matters that are pending. Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Understood. Maybe one more, the truck competition in your carload merchandise business, can you shed a little light on where you might be bleeding share to truck, or you seeing a bit more acute pressure on price in some of this carload business, as you alluded to earlier? And from a high level, do you have a sense of how much this has been a drag on your overall volumes? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Bascome, we talked about intermodal. Your question is specific to merchandise at carload, correct? So I'll address that. I mentioned the fact that we are seeing additional competition within our Ag markets. That also has to do with the strength of the crop in the Southeast; it opens up local \u2013 local corn into our network, which can move via truck. We're seeing some truck competition in the paper market into the Southeast. So it certainly has had an impact, as we know, on our domestic intermodal volumes and also on our carload business. Going forward, it's \u2013 we're going to be looking closely at energy prices, the impact they have on truck, on truck availability and on commodity prices and retail inventories. Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Thank you for the time. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rob Salmon with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, good morning, and thanks for taking the question. I'm going to kind of circle back to Chris's question regarding productivity. You guys have done a good job extending train lengths. They were up a little bit in the quarter. However, if I'm looking at head count per carload that was essentially flat. Can you walk me through some of the puts and takes and what it would take to get back to a little under 70 where you peaked out a couple years ago with regard to head count per carload? Is this a mix issue, or should we be thinking about a lot of operating leverage as volumes build, particularly in the merchandise and intermodal? Michael Joseph Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer : Yes, there is a mix issue there. And as volumes are softening, we take train starts out of the network to build up other trains, and that's a balancing act. You don't want to do that real quickly, because you don't want to hurt the service on the network. So that's the challenge there. But the good news is going forward that gives you great operating leverage. And for us, we've got capacity on the trains in all commodity groups, really. We've got capacity on the network and we've got capacity in our resources of locomotives and crews. So we've got a lot of leverage to the upside. But if volumes remain soft, we continue to whittle at the resources to make sure that all the productivity and efficiency is there. Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Can you give us a sense of the \u2013 how much below you are the optimal train size opportunity in your merchandise and intermodal networks as I think about what that leverage could be? Michael Joseph Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer : We've got a good ways to go both on the merchandise side and the intermodal side. We're very comfortable where that's at. Being able to add more units to both of those trains before we start train starts and then if we need to do train starts we'll add that on; that will be a good news story. But we feel very comfortable about capacity on both of those, particularly the intermodal. We have such a great double-stack network that gives us a lot of efficiency. Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And any sense in terms of just the magnitude of delta versus optimal? Michael Joseph Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer : No, because I think you get down to \u2013 get down to the lane level and the terminal level and a lot of details there. But we take every opportunity we can. Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Understood. Appreciate the time. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Jason H. Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everybody. Two quick things from me. One following up on your commentary in the intermodal versus truck marketplace, I think you guys said that there's been some sequential improvement especially over the last month. I was wondering if you could elaborate on that and let us know, has it been an increase in truck spot pricing? Has there been a decrease in available trucks? Any color would be appreciated on that comment. Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Jason, we have seen an increase in truck spot pricing. It's increasing sequentially; it's not increasing year-over-year. Jason H. Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. That's a good update. Also, maybe this one might be for Jim. Jim, I think when we came into this year in terms of the total restructuring plan at Norfolk you talked about 1,600 miles of track divestitures and that you would do 1,000 or at least let us know where the 1,000 was going by the end of this year. I think you've done just over 300 miles so far this year. Wondered if you can give us an update. James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Sure. We're making good progress there, as in other areas of productivity and restructuring, and we're on track to hit or exceed that mileage goal for the full year. Mike, why don't you talk a little bit more specifically about some of the areas where we're working that? Michael Joseph Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer : Yeah. So we've got a lot going on there. We've got two pieces to this : this is the \u2013 where we're doing some short-lining and we've got a short line of the West Virginia secondary that'll happen here, actually next week. So that's a piece of it. We're looking at other parts of the railroad as well. But the other piece to it on the network rationalization is where we've spent a lot of time looking at where we can take resources out of the track structure without hurting service or safety. And that's been a good news story. We've got over 1,000 miles of that that's already happened on the railroad. And some of the benefits that we've seen in our cost reduction is related to that. More to come as we go forward. So we feel very comfortable about meeting or exceeding that. And I think we're thinking about giving an update on the third quarter on the details of actually where these are at. But anyway, kind of a wrap-up is we're ahead of schedule on it and we're seeing good costs come out of the network. But more importantly, the safety and service has remained high on those areas. Jason H. Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC: That was a great update, guys. I appreciate the time as always. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey, thanks. Morning, guys. Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : Morning. James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Scott. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Marta, can you help clarify one thing? So I get the incentive comp's a year-over-year headwind in the third quarter. Is it a sequential headwind from 2Q to 3Q? Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : It's a very small sequential headwind going forward. As you saw, it wasn't one of the year-over-year items that I needed to highlight, so that gives you an indication it's a smaller size. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : So if it's a small sequential headwind and you're expecting some volume improvement, I guess I'm a little confused why you think the operating ratio gets worse in the third quarter than the second quarter. Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : We're really just talking very tiny basis points. I think in response to Allison's questions, I think the best thing when you're looking at the expense projection sequentially going forward, other than the two items that I mentioned, the incentive comp and the materials, we think you will see us at about the run rate that we had in the second quarter. So we're really talking degrees, very small degrees. And again, I'll emphasize it depends on the volume growth and the commodities that it comes in. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay, that makes sense. Can you give an update just on the fuel surcharge side and how much of the business you've transitioned over? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes, Scott, first and foremost, we are focused on price. And, so as we enter into any negotiation, that's our target initially. We have been successful and made some progress; and right now about 40% of our revenue is tied to WTI. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay, and then just lastly, Alan, can you just give us an update? What's the mix of your coal business in terms of how much is App versus Illinois Basin and PRB today? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : So, the second quarter we saw a mix increase of Central App. So we had about 34% of our volume was Central App, about 30% was Northern App. Illinois basin was about 21%, and then PRB, Scott, fill in the rest. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Thank you, guys. Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : Welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.: Thanks and good morning. So first, I was wondering if you could just comment on how you are thinking about the progression of your intermodal volumes in the back half of the year. And bigger picture, do you think this recent weakness in intermodal volumes that we've seen for the industry as a whole is a temporary headwind? Or do you have concern the consumer could be rolling over? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Justin, we think we're going to have continued improvement in our intermodal volumes. June was a good month for us. We see continued growth as we, and our customers see the benefit of our improved service product. Secondly, our customers are preparing for a tightness in truck capacity. And what you're seeing there is more growth with asset-based carriers. So, we do think it's a temporary headwind. As fuel prices go up, that will also benefit us. But certainly we're paying close attention to retail inventory levels. Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.: Okay, but just to be clear, you think your intermodal volumes will be up in the back half? Is that what you said? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes. Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.: Okay, great. Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Ex Triple Crown. Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.: Ex Triple Crown? Okay, got you. Secondly, we've always heard about coal being the highest-margin business for the rails. But with your coal volumes down over 20% year-to-date and the pressure we've seen over the last couple of years, has this changed? Has the gap between coal margins and your consolidated margins closed? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : There continues to be pressure on our coal franchise. That market is dynamic, and so are we, and so we are focused on improving the profitability and the returns on all of our lines of business. Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. But that gap between coal and everything else really hasn't changed? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : As I suggested, we're focused on improving the profitability on all lines of our business. Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. I'll leave it at that. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. So, Jim, appreciate that you guys managed through a pretty difficult second quarter with a sub-70% OR. But we do have a lot of the industry that's running even sub-65% OR, if not even well below that, in the current volume environment. So, and as we've talked a lot about the OR progression kind of sequentially flattish, if not even up a little bit into the back half of the year, how much of your productivity savings are really just hoping for volume growth versus \u2013 what more can you do structurally? I mean we've seen Triple Crown, we've seen the hump yard closures, we've seen you go from two operating regions to three operating regions or three operating regions to two operating regions. So what structurally is left in the network that you can identify from a cost standpoint? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Well, the key to delivering on a plan is flexibility, and that's what we demonstrated in the second quarter. The plan is dynamic. It is flexible and able to address changing market conditions, as we've outlined. We will continue to evaluate efficiencies in all areas and ensure that we have the opportunity to adjust things going forward as necessary. Certainly there is a component of growth assumed in our longer-range plan, and we believe we'll see that. If we don't, we will make adjustments as necessary to achieve our goals. Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. But as of now, then, there's nothing really structurally on the plate that you're looking at changing operationally for the company? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : We've made a number of changes that I would characterize as structural already, and we'll be on the lookout for further opportunities there. Cost-cutting is always a combination of short-term cost reductions in response to immediate business conditions and then a long-term outlook on structure. And we have initiatives in place in both areas, both short-term reductions as necessary and longer-term structural activities that will help to shape the cost structure of the company in the future. Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thanks for that. And just, real clarification on CapEx. I know we talked a little bit about the outlook heading into next year and the years beyond. But should we be thinking CapEx actually can come down? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Post-PTC, we have guided to CapEx below current levels relative to sales. So, yes, when we get to that point. As I've said, the keys are safety, efficiency, and customer service. That forms your baseline for capital spending. Beyond that baseline, it's all about the returns on the incremental investment. And we will look carefully at every additional dollar we spend. As I mentioned, what we would love investors to focus on out of this call is the way we have managed CapEx this year. In response to business conditions, we have been every bit as determined to modulate CapEx as we have expenses. And that's our commitment going forward as well. Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Appreciate the time. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Alan, I just wanted to get your view on export coal trends. Clearly volatile, but you did a little bit better than the 3 million tons per quarter in 2Q. So you see the coking coal benchmark nearing $100 per ton; API 2 is close to $60 per ton. Do you think you can perhaps run closer to 3.6 million tons throughout the rest of the year if the pricing holds? Or was there something kind of one-off that helped boost volumes this quarter? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Brian, it is an extremely volatile market. We are impacted by the health of the producers and bankruptcies, and they are doing everything they can to produce coal and sell it overseas, but it's highly dependent upon global demand and seaborne trade. And right now those are fairly weak. So, our guidance has typically been 2.5 million tons to 3 million tons a quarter. We exceeded that, as you noted, last quarter. We're going to continue with that guidance for this quarter. But it's so volatile and there's a lot of pressures there that it would be difficult to call an upside or a downside to that. Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, fair enough. And then I don't know if you've commented on it specifically, but if you could, in the context of a long-term strategic plan, what type of options do you think there are for Lambert's Point considering the way that the markets are now? China demand is down, and clearly the volatility remains. Have you thought through or is that built into the strategic plan at all? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : What is built into the strategic plan is our continuing focus on monitoring our markets and adjusting our resources accordingly. And, you saw that as we've idled Ashtabula and we've idled Knoxville yard, and we combined the Pocahontas division with the Virginia division, which was effectively a coal play. Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Right. And, just one quick follow-up for Marta. In the past, you've given out the net fuel impact which was obviously quite significant in 2015. I think it was about $20 million unfavorable in the first quarter. Do you have the impact and what it was in the second quarter? Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : If you look at our fuel surcharge revenue, it was $50 million in the quarter which was a $69 million reduction. So comparing that to the drop in fuel expense of $81 million, there was a little bit of a net, small tailwind in the quarter. Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. All right. Thanks for your time. Operator : Our next question comes from line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question. Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks good morning. You mentioned in your prepared remarks in the automotive sector some competitive losses and lesser demand impacting the back half. Could you just elaborate a little bit on what you're seeing and perhaps some feel for the magnitude of what that might be? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes, Scott. We said that there are some specific models typically in passenger cars, in which the plants are undergoing retooling which are going to impact our volumes in the second half of the year. We also as you'll recall on our first-quarter call pointed towards the fact that comps would get a lot more difficult towards the latter end of the year because the second half of 2015 service started to improve and we started to work through the backlog of shipments in the automotive network; that in and of itself will put pressure on year-over-year comps. We still feel consistent with what we said on the first-quarter call that our overall volumes for the year in automotive are going to approximate the North American vehicle growth which Ward's right now puts at 1.1%. Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Great, thanks. And then I don't know if I \u2013 you might have mentioned, I don't know if I caught it. The $100 million reduction in the CapEx this year, could you elaborate on maybe what the top two or three categories are that you're able to trim in the here and now? Thanks. Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : All right. Yes, Scott. We've actually so far this year had $200 million in capital reductions. On the first-quarter call we lowered our CapEx forecast for the full year from $2.1 billion to $2 billion. Today we've indicated as Jim has mentioned a couple of times that we are modulating our capital. We're being proactive as we see the volume softening and lowered another $100 million. So we're currently at $1.9 billion. And the reductions have come in three general areas. The first area is in the unit costs; and that's a very good news story because what Mike and the operating team has been able to do is, in our maintenance of way area, they are reducing, because we have more track time and some other efficiencies that they have come up with, the self-constructed assets that we do on our right-of-way. They've got less labor cost per unit. They have also got slightly lower pricing on some of the materials. So the reductions there are in the unit cost. So they are putting in the same number of units that we had planned but it costs less. The next biggest grouping is in the locomotive area. Mike mentioned that we do a lot of our locomotive work in-house. We have rebuilds that we had in the capital plan. As the year went on and the volumes didn't come, we pulled out some of those rebuilds. So we have the flexibility to defer those and do them at a later year when we need the locomotives. And the third area is spread around all the various parts of the capital budget. And that is where we've either been able to trim the costs, in some cases in the materials cost, or we've been able to defer it, because the volumes haven't come. An example of that would be parking at an intermodal terminal. So, we might say we were going to expand parking, but we'll do it next year. Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : You're welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Larkin with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. John Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes. Good morning everybody, and thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to focus in on intermodal a little bit, if that's okay. In your case, international freight looks a little better than domestic. That's kind of backwards relative to what we're seeing across the broader industry. Is there any particular reason why your intermodal is up? You've apparently grabbed some market share there, is that a service issue? Is that pricing, cost differential? Just geographic franchise advantage? What's really driving that? And then what's holding back the growth of domestic? Was it the service quality issues, which perhaps caused a bit of a market share loss? Are you gaining any of that market share loss back on the domestic side? Thanks. Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : John, the international is a story of our network reach and it's a story of a shift, although moderate, but continual, from West Coast ports to East Coast ports. And certainly, our port partners on the East Coast feel that the widening of the Panama Canal will continue that progression. With respect to our domestic intermodal franchise, that has clearly been limited by surplus dry van capacity in the truck market, and then high retail inventory levels. As both of those moderate, we'll start to see growth in that network. And our continued improvements in our service product are helping us convert from highway to rail. John Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it. Thank you very much for that. And then on the labor side, are there any major labor contract negotiations forthcoming here? And what would you expect labor cost, fully loaded with fringes, to inflate at here over the next couple of years? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : I'll turn it over to Marta to comment on projected labor inflation. The entire industry, as you know, is engaged in collective bargaining over the terms of industry-wide agreements going forward, and we'll just have to see how that proceeds. Obviously, it's a protracted negotiation. It always is. Particularly in an election year, though you tend to see that even more protracted than usual. Marta, what are you seeing in terms of labor inflation down the road? Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : So for this year, 2016, we guided to overall comp and benefit inflation, labor inflation, of 3.5%. And that's a blend of wage inflation and medical inflation, which has been running quite high this year. For next year, it's still too soon to give a number. But we'll try to clarify that for you on the January call. John Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Appreciate it. Thank you. Marta R. Stewart - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Finance : You're welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Vernon with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning, and thanks for taking the question. Marta and Jim, I just want to try to get a sense for what's between where we are today, at a $200 million annual run rate of productivity, and the $600 million that you've got in your longer-term plan. I think I'm hearing you say, Marta, that expenses are going to be kind of flat to maybe sequentially up a little bit here in the back half. I'm just trying to get an understanding of what is it that is between us and that higher productivity number. Is it capital investment, system investments, labor? And then maybe as a follow-up, are you thinking at all about maybe some more extensive co-production with CSX in some of the lower-density markets like coal, whether it's at the terminals or in the actual coal lines, up into the coal fields themselves? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : So, six months into a five-year plan, we've made substantial progress on productivity, and we're sticking to our $200 million projected annual savings this year, at least $200 million. So we're well on our way to the $650 million by 2020. As you know, the components of that $650 million are heavily weighted to compensation and benefits savings, and that's a variety of elements. We have additional room to run in terms of fuel consumption improvements, that's part of the longer-range plan. We'll continue to whittle away at locomotive maintenance costs. That's another component of the plan. And reduced equipment cost is a fourth element where we still have opportunity. Now, in terms of co-production, anywhere it makes sense to for us to share assets with others operationally we will certainly be open to doing so. That's a way to improve asset utilization for both parties. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: But maybe just as a follow-up to that, like, as you think about going from that $200 million to, say, $400 million or whatever it's going to be on labor and compensation, how important is volume inflection to getting to that number? Is there something you're going to do operationally or investment-wise that's going to allow you to then run that much more productively in a year or two? Like, I'm just trying to get a sense for what the keys are to unlock that additional benefit. And I know it's an annual process where you're looking at ways to pull cost out, but is there anything you can point to that says : When we get here, this is going to help us run a lot more productively? James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Well, certainly volume helps productivity. There's no doubt about it, because of the incremental operating leverage inherent in the business. But the key to the plan is flexibility. And we believe that we can achieve these levels of productivity going forward. We recognize the plan is dynamic, volume conditions are changeable, and we'll make the adjustments as necessary. If required, we'll go after deeper structural costs to achieve our goals. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: All right. Well, thanks a lot for the time, and good job so far as far as getting the cost out. Talk to you soon. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Buckingham Research. Please proceed with your question. Jeffrey A. Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Thank you very much. A lot of my questions have been asked, so let me just throw out a quick one. If I back out the fuel impact, it looks like revenue per unit was just a little bit less than flat. Can you break out the mix versus pricing component of that? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : It is all mix, Jeff. If you take a look at the mix effect within coal, our export volumes trended more towards thermal coal than metallurgical coal. You take a look at it within intermodal. And as we've talked about, domestic volumes were pressured. The TCS restructuring impacted RPU and international business has a lower RPU than us. And then take a deeper dive into our merchandise market, and you can see declines in frac sand and crude oil pressure in overall RPU. So it was slightly down ex fuel, but it was all a mix impact. Jeffrey A. Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: All right, if I back out the mix, what does core pricing look like, say, this quarter and relative to last quarter? Alan H. Shaw - Chief Marketing Officer & Executive Vice President : It's up this quarter over last quarter, and it's up over the same quarter last year, and it's up over rail inflation. Jeffrey A. Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. Hey, congratulations. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC. Please proceed with your question. Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. Just wanted to touch on a little bit broader topic of new technology that you might have coming down the pipe. I know in the past technological innovation, like distributed power, has allowed you to increase train length; and some of the Trip Optimizer software has given you some pretty interesting fuel improvements. I guess the first part of that question : Are we pretty much done now? I know you've talked a bit about train lengths and how there's still a little bit of opportunity, but it sounds like it's more product-driven rather than technologically driven. And just correct me if I'm wrong there. And the second part, is there anything \u2013 and perhaps this is for Mike. Mike, when you look down the pipe, is there anything that gets you excited in terms of technological improvements that could lead to some further cost savings? I know within trucking we're going as far as talking about autonomous trucks. Could we eventually see one-person crews, that kind of thing? Just love to get your thoughts on that. Michael Joseph Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer : Yeah. Well, on the run rate of the things you talked about, which is DP and the fuel efficiency technology we're using, we still have run rate to go there and we still continue to implement it across the railroad. So we still have some opportunities going forward. And, as Jim noted on the fuel efficiency as part of our plan, that's a part of it. So yeah, we feel like opportunity there. On the technology side, I don't see that there's any one big thing that we're kind of hanging our hat on. But I will tell you that we have technology embedded throughout our organizations on making us better. Whether it's using alerts or using mobile platforms for the supervisors out in the field, things like that, we have just continued to utilize technology throughout our operational organization to make us safer and more efficient. Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: And on one-person crews? Michael Joseph Wheeler - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer : That's a \u2013 that's a big industry initiative. And there's going to have to be a lot with the regulatory side there as well. Of course, you know we've got a lot of one-person crews at our railroad now, whether it's pusher, or whether it's remote control. But we work with the regulators on what are the opportunities there going forward in the industry. Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: Okay. All right. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. Mr. Squires, I would now like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments. James A. Squires - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer : Well, thank you very much for attending today's conference call. And we'll be back to report on our third-quarter results in a few months. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.",

Donald Allen Broughton - Avondale Partners LLC Operator : Greetings, and welcome to the Norfolk Southern's Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Katie Cook, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Ms. Cook. You may begin. Katie U. Cook - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Thank you, Rob, and good morning. Before we begin today's call, I would like to mention a few items. The slides of the presenters are available on our website at norfolksouthern.com in the Investor section, along with our non-GAAP reconciliations. Additionally, transcripts and downloads of today's call will be posted on our website. During this call, we may make certain forward-looking statements which are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and may differ materially from our actual results. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. Now, it is my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's Chairman, President and CEO, Jim Squires. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Norfolk Southern's third-quarter 2016 earnings call. With me today are NS's Chief Marketing Officer, Alan Shaw; our Chief Operating Officer, Mike Wheeler; and our Chief Financial Officer, Marta Stewart. Our results this quarter, summarized on slide 4, reflect the successful proactive measures and strategies that Norfolk Southern continues to employ as we relentlessly focus on delivering results through efficiencies and asset utilization. We continue our focus on deploying resources to improve service and network performance, while streamlining our corporate assets. Targeted cost initiatives and the disposition of surplus operating property, combined with the lapping of prior-year restructuring costs, drove a 67.5% operating ratio. This marked an improvement of 220 basis points or 3% compared to last year, as operating expenses came in 10% lower relative to a 7% decline in revenue. We extended the high performance levels we have reliably delivered throughout this year into the third quarter, resulting in a record 68.7% operating ratio for the nine-month period. As a result of our efforts, earnings-per-share for the quarter increased to $1.55, up 4% compared to last year's $1.49. For the nine-month period, earnings per share increased 8% year-over-year. Importantly, we have significantly improved network performance as shown by our composite service metric, which was up 8% for the quarter and 14% for the year. These results, in addition to feedback I am receiving first-hand from our customers, confirm what we already know. Our commitment to customer service in tandem with our disciplined cost measures continues to move our company in the right direction. With respect to network initiatives, Mike will go over our progress in greater detail, but let me highlight that our team has already exceeded the 2016 rationalization goal of 1000 miles, and we'll continue to pursue these kinds of opportunities in the future. Turning to slide five, as we entered this year we had committed to lowering our operating ratio below 70% for the year, which I am pleased to say we are well-positioned to achieve even with economic headwinds. Our cost savings initiatives will generate productivity savings of at least $200 million for the year, upwards of $250 million in fact, and we will contain capital spending to $1.9 billion, which is lower than our original $2.1 billion plan, as we continually reassess the optimal deployment of capital in this changing economic environment. Our employees have consistently demonstrated their commitment to reliably delivering superior results in what has been a dynamic and challenging economic environment. We have worked hard to build a flexible strategy, one that stages us well for top-line growth coupled with annual productivity savings, which are targeted for over $650 million by 2020. This team's strong start in 2016 reinforces my confidence in our ability to achieve a sub-65% operating ratio by 2020 and deliver substantial shareholder value. Now, Alan will cover trends in revenue; Mike will provide more detail on how we're managing the operation, including the progress I mentioned on our line rationalization initiatives; and Marta will summarize our financial results. Then we'll take your questions. Thank you, and now I will turn the call over to Alan. Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Thank you, Jim, and good morning to our audience. We appreciate your joining us today. So easing economic headwinds contributed to a 3% sequential improvement in revenue. As compared to the second quarter of 2016 (sic) [2015] (5:39), our $2.5 billion in third-quarter revenue represented a 7% year-over-year decline, primarily driven by decreases in energy-related markets and the Triple Crown restructure. The hot summer and sequentially higher natural gas prices softened declines in utility coal, though high stockpile levels continue to dampen year-over-year comparisons. The Triple Crown restructure enhanced our overall efficiency and profitability, while yielding year-over-year volume and revenue declines since the fourth quarter of 2015. While energy prices improved in the third quarter, they remained below last year's levels and negatively influenced fuel surcharge revenue and several merchandise commodities, including crude oil and natural gas products. Amid the challenging economic conditions, intermodal remained a bright spot with improved service driving growth in domestic business. Despite pricing gains, revenue per unit declined 3% due to negative mix associated with increased intermodal freight and decreased coal volume as well as lower fuel surcharge revenue. Merchandise revenue and volume, as shown on slide eight, fell 4% in the third quarter. Our chemicals franchise, impacted by continued reductions in crude oil shipments as well as plant closures and consolidations in our industrial intermediates markets, further declined from the second quarter and was the primary driver of the year-over-year merchandise decrease. Agriculture was impacted by reduced feed, wheat and corn volume compared to 2015. Automotive shipments were down as a result of a competitive loss, as mentioned on our second quarter call, and production declines at several NS-served plants. A weak pulp board market combined with increased truck competition negatively impacted paper and forest products volume. These decreases were partially offset by metals and construction volume, which increased year-over-year and sequentially due to stronger shipments of steel and aggregates. As compared to last year, merchandise RPU increased 1%, reflecting positive pricing gains, partially offset by negative mix associated with increased aggregates and coiled steel as well as reduced industrial intermediates and machinery volume. Turning to intermodal on slide nine, volume declined 1% as year-over-year growth in domestic and international volume nearly offset the declines related to the Triple Crown restructure. Excluding Triple Crown, volume was up 6%, while revenue increased 5%. Despite excess truck capacity, our approved service product drove an 8% year-over-year increase in domestic intermodal business. International volume increased 1% compared to a strong third quarter last year. Lower volumes of higher-rated Triple Crown freight and lower fuel surcharge revenue negatively impacted RPU, down 7% as compared to last year. Excluding Triple Crown and fuel surcharges, RPU was up 2% in this highly competitive truck price environment, while revenue improved 8%. On slide 10, coal revenue was down 18% for the quarter, with a 15% volume decline as compared to last year. Year-over-year utility volume continued to be negatively impacted by low natural gas prices and above-normal stockpile levels. Warmer summer weather and sequentially higher natural gas prices improved coal dispatch and utility deliveries as the third quarter progressed, generating 18.4 million utility tons, a 28% improvement from the second quarter. Future utility volumes will be dependent upon weather conditions, natural gas prices, and stockpile levels. Between May and September, stockpiles declined by approximately 20 days of burn, though they remained 25 days above targeted levels and are expected to impact utility volumes into next year. Assuming normal weather conditions and natural gas pricing consistent with the current forward curve, we expect to handle between 15 million and 18 million utility tons in the fourth quarter. While there has been recent strength in spot pricing in the seaborne markets, U.S. export supply has been constrained by the impact of bankruptcies and production rationalizations. Third quarter thermal exports through Baltimore declined significantly as tonnage shifted to the domestic utility market. For the fourth quarter, we expect to handle 3 million to 4 million export tons, with sequential increases in thermal coal through Baltimore. Coal RPU excluding fuel was down 2% in the third quarter, with positive pricing offset by the mix of reduced export volume. Turning to our outlook on slide 11, we expect fourth quarter volumes to be flat or increase modestly year-over-year due in part to somewhat easier comparisons. In mid-November we will cycle the impact of Triple Crown. The fourth quarter of 2015 also marked the start of the unseasonably warm winter that generated access coal stockpiles, the effect of global steel oversupply, as well as the beginning of the impact of increased manufacturing and retail inventories. Lastly, we expect a lower year-over-year fuel surcharge revenue decline with WTI and on-highway diesel prices close to fourth quarter 2015 levels. Though some coal stockpile correction occurred in the third quarter, we expect the ongoing inventory overhang to impact fourth quarter utility coal volumes. Sustained low oil prices and a narrow spread between Brent and WTI will continue to limit crude oil rail volume. Though automotive volume for the full year is expected to exceed North American vehicle production growth of 1%, fourth quarter shipments will decline as compared to last year. We anticipate year-over-year service-driven growth within intermodal. We will maintain our focus on improved pricing, reflecting the value of our service product. Overall revenue per unit will be impacted by the ongoing mix headwinds associated with increased intermodal and decreased coal freight. Our long-term view on both markets and pricing enables us to navigate the current economic headwinds while positioning us for future growth. Marketing continues to work closely with operations and finance, executing on our financial plan amid dynamic market conditions, controlling what we can control, ensuring that resources are in place to support expected volumes and allowing us to take advantage of opportunities for long-term growth. I will now turn it over to Mike to discuss our operational performance. Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Thank you, Alan. I am pleased to announce we are continuing to operate at high service levels while making outstanding progress on our cost reduction initiatives. As Jim noted, the progress we have made is a testament to our employees and their commitment and focus in executing the key drivers of our strategic plan. Let me begin with safety on slide 13. While our reportable injury ratio increased in the third quarter as compared to the same period last year, we had an 18% improvement in our serious injury ratio. Turning to service on slide 14, you see we continued to execute at a very high level, as evidenced by our service composite, train speed, and terminal dwell metrics. This is the second quarter in a row with the service composite above 80%. For the third quarter, our service composite and train speed both improved 8%, and dwell improved 3% versus the same period last year. Overall, our velocity as measured at the car level remains near record levels and continues to aid asset utilization and strong customer service. What is most encouraging is that we had been able to do this while aggressively pursuing cost-reduction initiatives, as evidenced by our 67.5% operating ratio. The improvements in our service metrics demonstrate our continued commitment to driving productivity improvements and increasing customer service. Now, on slide 15, these cost-cutting initiatives, coupled with our ability to keep the railroad operating at a high level, continue to result in significant productivity savings. The reduction in crew starts for the third quarter significantly outpaced the decline in volume, and we have continued to improve our re-crews, overtime, and train length. Through the third quarter, we have achieved our highest average train length on record. Even with this significant improvement in train length, our velocity has been roughly the same as our record levels of 2012 and 2013. Together this resulted in improved employee productivity. Turning to slide 16, in our previous call, we said we would give an update on our network rationalization efforts. We have been going at this in a very deliberate way, with three separate strategies tailored to the specific circumstances with the goal of maintaining or improving service to our customers while reducing our costs and investments needs. To that end, the most visible way we are changing the network is getting a short-line carrier to operate lower-volume segments. We have completed one large transaction with the West Virginia secondary and another transaction is in process. This benefits NS by enabling us to improve capital allocation, continue to serve the customers, and maintain our network reach. As illustrated on slide 17, we are also concentrating flows on fewer routes. For example, we idled one of our steepest and most difficult to operate lines in the coal fields by rerouting coal trains onto our main line, which had excess capacity. To retain flexibility, the old route was left in place for now in case there is a business rebound. We have done this at several locations, even outside the coal network, and are continuing to identify opportunities across the system. Lastly, on slide 18, even if we decide to continue using a route, we have found it is possible to reduce speeds without effecting customer service. These are our secondary mainlines. By reducing speeds, we can extend the life of track without affecting safety and delay reinvestment needs. We also realize some modest expense savings as well. This is a new strategy for NS, and reflects a willingness to reexamine our business model in the face of economic realities. Using our full toolkit we have already exceeded our 1,000-mile goal for 2016, while velocity and service have remained near our historic highs. I will now turn it over to Marta who will cover the financials. Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. The third quarter results showed continued strong cost control in the face of modest overall volume decline. Let's take a look at the financial details, starting with operating results on slide 20. While revenues were down 7% on 4% lower volume, operating expenses declined by 10%. The 67.5% operating ratio for the quarter was a 3% improvement over last year's third quarter, and the operating ratio of 68.7% for the first nine months with an all-time record. Slide 21 shows the expense reduction by income statement line item. Every category of cost was lower in 2015, a result of targeted expense reduction initiatives and the lower volume. Additionally, the comparison was affected by last year's restructuring costs, particularly in depreciation. Now let's take a closer look at the components. Slide 22 highlights the major drivers of the variance in compensation and benefits. While the overall net change was relatively small at $11 million, it contained some offsetting items. First, with regard to employee count and employee hours, the efficiency improvements in the first half of the year continued, as overall head count was down over 2,400 employees versus last year and was down slightly sequentially. This reduced head count, along with lower overtime and fewer re-crews, resulted in $47 million of year-over-year savings, and the associated payroll taxes were favorable by $5 million. We also had $9 million in lower pension expense. These items helped offset increases in incentive compensation of $39 million, wage inflation of $14 million, and health and welfare rate increases of $12 million. For the remainder of the year, we expect head count to remain relatively flat sequentially. With regard to incentive comp, wage rates, and health and welfare costs, we expect to have similar year-over-year increases in the fourth quarter as we had in the third quarter. Slide 23 depicts purchased services and rents, which was down $65 million or 14% year-over-year. The largest reduction was attributable to $37 million in decreased Triple Crown costs. Recall that the curtailment of Triple Crown operations was effective on November 15 of last year, so our fourth quarter variance for this item will be about half this amount. Also contributing to the reduction in this line item was $7 million of lower equipment rents. This was due primarily to the improved velocity Mike described, and we expect this benefit to continue into the fourth quarter. Next is fuel expense as shown on slide 24. The $40 million or 18% decline in fuel cost for the quarter was largely a result of lower oil prices, which decreased the price per gallon by 12%. We also had lower consumption due to the lower traffic volume. Slide 25 details our materials and other category, which decreased $54 million or 22% year-over-year. This improvement reflects $28 million of gains on the sale of two operating properties. Next, reductions in material costs totaling $15 million were primarily for locomotives and freight car materials. And the last variance on the slide is principally due to moving costs associated with last year's Roanoke office closure. Turning to non-operating items on slide 26. This too was affected by the prior-year comparison, as we had a large gain on the sale of a non-operating property in the third quarter of 2015. Somewhat offsetting this decrease were higher returns from corporate-owned life insurance. Moving on to income taxes on slide 27, the effective rate for the third quarter was 34.8% versus 37.6%. The lower effective rate was related to the increased life insurance returns as well as to the effects of stock-based compensation and several other smaller items. For the full year we now expect to have an effective income tax rate of roughly 36%. Summarizing our third quarter earnings on slide 28, net income was $460 million, up 2% versus 2015, and diluted earnings per share were $1.55, 4% higher than last year. Wrapping up with year-to-date cash flows on slide 29, cash from operations was $2.3 billion and free cash flow was a little over $1 billion. With respect to capital returned to shareholders, we have paid $523 million in dividends and repurchased 603 million of our shares. We remain on track for full-year capital spending of $1.9 billion and share repurchases of $800 million. Thank you for your attention, and I'll turn the program back to Jim. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Thank you, Marta. Let me close by saying that the focus, agility and determination of our team are readily apparent in our performance this year. As we move forward we are well positioned for growth opportunities longer-term and confident in our ability to drive shareholder value. And with that, we will now open the line for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Jason Seidl with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Jason H. Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Good morning, Jason. Jason H. Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC: I guess I wanted to start off with sort of your RPU, and you mentioned in the coal business, RPU I think was negatively impacted a little bit by a mix shift away from some of the export. But I think in your commentary you also said that sequentially as we look to 4Q that we should start seeing a pickup on some of the thermal exports. Should I assume that that's going to positively impact your RPU reported when we see the fourth quarter numbers, all things being equal? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: No, Jason, the thermal coal typically goes through Baltimore, which is a lower length of haul for us. And so I want to make it clear that, while we will enjoy the increase in the coal through Baltimore and that growth, that will be a drag on RPU... Jason H. Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. No, that's good clarification. Also, you guys noted you are ahead of schedule here in your, let's call it network rationalization, I know you have that pending stuff down in Delaware that you're doing. In terms of how it flows through the income statement, I'm assuming there's very little, but it's probably more on the CapEx side. Is that the right way of looking at the 1,000 miles that you've done already? And is there potential that you exceed that \u2013 I think the original mark was 1,600 miles ultimately that you looked at? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Mike, why don't you take that question? Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Sure. Yeah, Jason, you are exactly right. There is some modest expense savings, but the main driver is it allows us to reallocate capital, and going forward we plan to meet our goal for 2020, and we're going to keep looking for opportunities and if there's more we'll take them. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Jason, the short-line strategy is about putting the right player on the field for the business, too, and serving the customer. And that's really what it's all about. There are some benefits financially as well, but this is really a strategy to provide the best service provider we can for the customer. Jason H. Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC: And in terms of that ultimate number of 1,600 miles, is that something that you're likely to exceed now, or is it just, that's what you identified and that's it? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Just technical correction, it's actually 1,500 miles is the goal. Jason H. Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC: 1,500, sorry. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: But we're on track. We are making great progress and we think there's definitely more to come. Jason H. Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you, guys for the time. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Good morning, Scott. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Alan, I wanted to just follow-up on the coal price \u2013 the coal RPU first. Are you seeing any of the pick-up in met export yet? And just given that the much higher, the benchmark, how quickly can you start raising your met rates, and do you plan to do so? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Scott, I'll address the first question. Initially we're going to see a slight uptick potentially in export met in the quarter. Most if not all of our uptick is going to be on the thermal side. As I noted in the comments, it's somewhat restricted by production, and the producers need to have some sort of comfort level that the prices that are out there now are sustainable. I don't think anybody believes they are going to stay at $200 per metric ton, but if they can get some sort of visibility that the prices are going to be at a level where they can bring back production, that will encourage more business \u2013 more production, and more business on us. We've taken a look at some of our export pricing in the fourth quarter, and we anticipate doing that again in the first quarter dependent upon market conditions. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : So given that of \u2013 a little bit more shorter length of haul export, that's lower RPU, a little bit more met, and then sounds like higher met pricing, in aggregate, would you think that coal RPU is flat, up, down sequentially? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: I think in the fourth quarter the shift of more lower length of haul thermal coal through Baltimore will offset pricing increases that we have. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay, got it. And then, Marta, just one for you on the operating ratio. I think at some point earlier this year you talked about kind of hoping for a sub-70% OR each of the second through fourth quarters. Is that still the way to think about the fourth quarter? Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yes, we're still expecting sub-70% OR in each of those quarters. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Thank you, appreciate it. Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Scott, I'd like to clarify a point. As I was talking about the offsets, I was speaking sequentially, not year-over-year. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Got it. Okay. Thank you. Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yeah. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Danny C. Schuster - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi, good morning. This is Danny Schuster on for Allison. Thank you for taking my question. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Good morning. Danny C. Schuster - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): I just wanted to ask how your same-store core pricing looks sequentially versus last quarter, and how we should think about that over the next quarter or two here? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Sure. Alan? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Sure. Danny, we're continuing to get traction in our pricing, and we are negotiating pricing in excess of inflation. As we've noted before, we are facing some limitations in the upside due to loose capacity in the trucking market. Danny C. Schuster - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, great. Thank you. And just wanted to follow up on some of your commentary on slowing speeds on secondary mainlines. How much longer do you think you can extend the life of the track, and how much of a dent cannot make in your overall maintenance infrastructure spending on an annual basis looking forward? Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Well, it really doesn't extend the life of the track. I mean, we are going to have that track, because it's part of our network reach always, and we'll have it maintained at the right level for the lower speeds. But it does \u2013 but it does allow reduced maintenance levels over time. Danny C. Schuster - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks, good morning. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Good morning, Chris. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): I wanted to ask about sort of the progress on the productivity side, so $250 million I think is the target now. I just wanted to get a rough sense of maybe how we think we're sort of progressing towards that $250 million? And maybe some initial thoughts on 2017, whether you should see this sort of a linear progression towards the $650 million or so over time, or just how we kind of think about the progress there? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Chris, let me address first the $250 million that we're currently targeting for the full year. We increased our outlook there from $200 million last quarter, reason being we found that even with the sequential uptick in volumes in the third quarter, we were able to hold the line on resources and did not incur additional overtime. In fact, year-over-year, overtime was again down considerably. Similarly, employee head count declined modestly sequentially; we had been forecasting flat. So that's the source of the \u2013 some of the additional productivity pickup in 2016. Marta, why don't you address 2017? We'll come back you with a more robust outlook on productivity and across the board in January when we report our fourth quarter earnings, but... Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Right. Mike and his folks are working now on our specific productivity initiatives for 2017, and as Jim mentioned, we're going to give you more details on our January call. We do expect to keep pushing on that, and they were \u2013 worked very hard this year, especially in light of the overall decline in volumes in the year, to accelerate as much of the productivity improvements as they did into 2016. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. That's helpful, that's great color. And then as a follow-up, just thinking about some of the network initiatives that you guys are undertaking and maybe some of the outsourcing into short-line or sales there, in terms of operating property gains on sales, should that be something that will be part of the calculus as we move forward? Is that something that might be recurring, or is it sort of more a little bit more one-time, you know, you see that it's a little bit lumpier here and there in various quarters? Just want to get a sense of maybe how to think about that bigger picture as you go through your process. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Sure. Those gains on sale do tend to be lumpy, and \u2013 so that, you know, there's a certain level of gains that we have experienced over the course of a year, but quarter-to-quarter it can vary quite a bit. We don't see the opportunity to recognize gains there from sale or disposition of operating properties, so much as a result of the line rationalization program; rather an initiative to just identify and dispose of surplus operating property. And so that's what we booked in the third quarter. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. So not necessarily core to the bigger picture productivity targets that you have? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Right. Right. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Thomas Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah, good morning. I wanted to ask you, you've commented a little bit on pricing but wanted to see if you could give perspective, I think one of the other railroads talked about \u2013 obviously, UNP talked about some, I think market challenges they said, in the coal and international intermodal markets. It was a little unclear whether that was increasing rail competition, or whether that was kind of structural pressures from customers. Are you seeing anything in those two markets where you'd say, the utilities are pushing us harder and we can't really resist, or change in container shipping line, the consolidation, Hanjin bankruptcy, if that's having an outsized impact on your pricing? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Let me comment on the question more broadly, and then I'll turn it over to Alan for the specifics. Alan mentioned loose truck capacity. Competition is alive and well, and we're facing intense modal competition. Nevertheless, with our service levels where they are, with the service product that we're offering, we feel confident that we will be paid for the value of our service rendered. And let me let Alan address the specific market that you referenced. Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Sure. You know, our price plan is consistent across all markets. And within coal we've talked about taking a look at the export pricing, ex-fuel surcharge; even though we had a pretty negative mix within coal, our coal RPU was only down 2% in the third quarter. Within international intermodal, we are continuing to line ourselves with folks who are adding capacity to the East Coast, and while the Hanjin did create a slight impact to us, we're taking a long-term focus on our pricing, because we have a better service product and we know service is key and core to our focus on pricing. Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great, thank you. For the second question, I just wondered if you could give a comment an incremental margin perspective in 2017? I mean I guess if we go back to \u2013 it's tough to know what volumes are, but if they're up a couple percent it seems like you'd be positioned to put a very strong incremental margin, maybe better than the kind of normal 50% we think of, just given the cost take-out, given capacity in the system. Is that a reasonable conclusion, that if you get a couple points of volume you might do a lot better than the typical 50% incremental next year? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Tom, I think we'll defer answering that question to January, when we'll come back to you with a more comprehensive outlook, including our expectation with regard to productivity, operating leverage, inflation and so forth. One thing I think worth flagging, though, is some rather extraordinary inflation factors next year, in particular health and welfare benefit costs. Marta? Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yes. We do expect that next year \u2013 as Jim said, we'll give you the total amount for the compensation and benefits, its expected inflation, in January, but we do already know that we're going to have higher inflation in the union medical. Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : Right. Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: And with regard to your incremental margin question, it really does depend on if we have growth, and as Mike and Jim have both said, with services positioning us to get that growth, if we have growth we will have incremental margin improvement in all of the categories. But recall that we have the incremental margin hierarchy which, dependent on where the volumes come, the order is \u2013 the most incrementally margin positive is merchandise, then coal, then intermodal. Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thank you for the detail. Appreciate it. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: You're welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions. Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah. Good morning everyone. Jim, can you talk to the commentary around slowing network speeds? I mean, I understand that on your secondary lines you could get some more capital out of it, especially if your volume's down. But I think generally when we've looked at significant OR improvement for other rails, it's been driven primarily by getting velocity up in the network. So is that the real long-term strategic vision, that in aggregate we want to have speeds lower or higher? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Well, definitely higher, and I think Mike emphasized that. The great thing about what we're doing is that we are able to slow down our trains in some parts of the network, without slowing network velocity overall. So it's a very targeted initiative. It does result in cost savings, primarily from longer maintenance cycles, on those branch lines. But overall network speeds are up, and that's where we want them to stay. Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.: And just remember, these secondary mainlines do have lower speeds originally before we reduced the speed. So it's not like our main lines that have the high speeds. So reduction in speed wasn't that significant, but it is in the capital reallocation. So that's why \u2013 because of that, we've still been able to keep our network velocity high, like I said, at the carload level at our record levels. Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And, Jim, sorry, I'm really stuffed up here. But can you talk a little bit about terminal rationalization? Because I do think that might be where some difference is between getting velocity higher, versus what the East Coast railroads have been able to do in the past. And I know when you launched your new plan you'd called out terminal rationalization as a piece of that opportunity. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Sure. Absolutely. And that's something that we're going to continue to look at, and there may be opportunities there. On the other hand, we want to maintain a certain level of customer service. We've underscored the importance of that several times. And having a robust classification yard network is one component of providing good service in our merchandise franchise. Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yeah. I'll just remind you that we did reduce one of the pump terminals out of our network this year, earlier this year, and then also one of our other pump terminals we've reduced the throughput, and therefore the cost, about half. So we continue to look at that, but all in light of making sure we keep the service product at the high levels. Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions. Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Morning, everyone. Jim, I think you mentioned that you continue to price above inflation. Do you have any thoughts on what inflation's looking like for next year? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Again, we'll defer an answer to that until January and give you our outlook there. It's obviously an important piece of the puzzle. But we did want to flag one inflation item in particular, that health and welfare benefits cost increase should be substantial next year. So that's a bit of a headwind, and there are some other things that are in play as well on the inflation front, but let us defer a complete answer until January. Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yes. And generally speaking, like we did this year \u2013 this year we gave for 2016 an overall comp and benefits inflationary increase of 3.5%, and the other expense categories are generally in line with inflation that you see in the rest of the economy. Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Understood. And just as a follow-up, given some of the changes you are making to the network, both with the rerouting as well as the short-line outsourcing, are you kind of fundamentally rethinking some of your end markets and where your growth comes from over time, and maybe, like some other rails, deemphasizing coal a little bit and focusing more on intermodal? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: No, I think we are continuing to focus on opportunities for growth wherever we can find them. We are intent on growing this company in the years to come, and want to have a solid platform for doing that across our different lines of business. Now naturally, the line rationalization opportunity is greater in some parts of the network than it is in others, particularly in the coalfield, and we've been through in past quarters what we have done specifically by the way of line rationalization there. But the end markets are what they've been, and the growth opportunities are what they have been as well. Alan, do you want to add a little color to that? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yeah. I would suggest that markets are dynamic, and so are we. So we are going to manage to the changing markets that we see. We are going to put a good service product out there that our customers value, and our customers' customers value, in an attempt to pull more business off the highway. That could be in an intermodal container, it can be in a gondola, it can be in a boxcar, it can be in a hopper. Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Very good. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.: Thanks, and good morning. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Hi, Justin. Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.: You talked about productivity of $250 million this year, but could you comment on how much of that amount is coming from restructuring Triple Crown and restructuring the coal network, or does that productivity number exclude those items? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: It excludes those items. So we don't count as productivity the restructure \u2013 lapping of the restructuring costs for Triple Crown, for example. Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Right. So the \u2013 if you look at the change from having had the restructuring charge last year to this year, we don't have that difference in the productivity improvement. We have ... Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: ... the benefit of running a more profitable, a more focused Triple Crown network and a more focused coal network. So the benefits after the changes are in productivity, but the variance due to the restructuring charge is not in that number. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: And with regard to the line rationalization initiatives, the productivity benefit there comes from reduced labor costs, from materials, maintenance expenditures, et cetera. So the line rationalization initiatives are not in it of themselves a productivity producer, but they spin off lots of productivity benefits in the forms I just mentioned, and others. Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.: Okay, great. That's helpful to clarify. And secondly, I know you aren't giving too many specifics on next year, but I was wondering if you would be willing to share any initial thoughts on how you believe volumes could trend in 2017, and maybe just directionally, it might be helpful if you could walk through some of the commodity groups where we could see meaningful moves, either up or down? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Okay. We can do that, bearing in mind that we'll present that in the context of an overall outlook in January. But Alan, talk about what we're seeing right now in terms of volume ups and downs next year. Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Certainly. I'll provide a broad overview, and then we'll be back with you on our January call. Intermodal, we continue to see growth in that franchise. Once you strip out the year-over-year impact of Triple Crown that will become readily evident. Ex Triple Crown and fuel surcharge in the fourth quarter, our intermodal revenue was up 8%. Coal is another one, and I want to make it perfectly clear, we had some very strong sequential improvements in coal in the third quarter, and coal in the fourth quarter is doing fine for us. Coal dispatch in the East right now is a load follower, and so it will be heavily dependent upon the weather. If we have a warm winter like we had last year, we're going to be in the same position in January as we were in January of this year. So that's why I think it's prudent for us to speak in more detail with you on our January call about volumes. Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.: Okay, great. And any thoughts on general merchandise as well? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Merchandise is going to have some puts and takes in it. Energy continues to be pressured, so we'll probably have some negative comps within our crude oil franchise. We're continuing to monitor steel capacity, plant utilization and steel pricing. That could potentially have an impact. So that's \u2013 we'll provide more color on the January call. Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Great. I'll leave it at that. Thanks for the time. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your questions. Kenneth S. Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Good morning. Just a clarification real quick. Marta, you had mentioned some asset sales had declined below the line, but then above the line, in operating income and other, you had an increase of $29 million this quarter. Just can you detail when and where you would put that above the line? Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yes, So as you know, Ken, and I think you and several others \u2013 of your colleagues had mentioned this over the years, there's historically been diversity in the industry of where land sales are. Over time the industry has moved to where almost everyone has the operating land sales in operating expenses, and then the non-operating ones down in other income. And so that's what we're doing here, too. The reason why I called it out this quarter was because it was so large. Kenneth S. Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Great, I just wanted to clarify that. Thank you. But \u2013 I know you're not giving too much detail on 2017 yet, but maybe just in general terms, Jim, can you talk about your thoughts on cash, and more specifically CapEx, given the reduced line maintenance and PTC kind of rolling over. Do you look at CapEx dropping down to, I don't know, 15%, 16% of revenues, or do you have some general thoughts on where you think CapEx goes? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Sure. We would expect to peg CapEx at 19% of revenue next year, and for 2018 as well. That's our current thinking on the level of CapEx, reflecting the continuing spend on Positive Train Control through 2018. After that, our plan is to reduce CapEx to 17% of revenue. That's obviously something we're going to continue to monitor, and we want to make sure that those investments are generating appropriate returns as we go through the plan period. But right now, that will be our plan, 19% for the next couple of years and then 17% thereafter. Kenneth S. Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So no real roll-off, given any of the, I guess, cost-savings or line rationalizations, in your view, for the next year or two? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: We're going to stick to the 19% of revenue for the next two years. Kenneth S. Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: We'll generate some savings from the line rationalization program, but we would expect to deploy that capital elsewhere. Kenneth S. Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Great. Thanks for the time. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions. Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: Yes. Thanks very much. So I want to come back to the land sales on the operating results, Marta. I know when you had given us some guidance around materials and other last quarter, and your operating ratio, you were giving us $10 million reduction in materials and an OR that would actually be up slightly in the third quarter. Yet with your land sale you're actually down $54 million and your OR was better, so it seems like it was really driven by the land sale. So my question is, you pointed us to sub-70% for fourth quarter, is that contingent or at what level of land sales would you expect to go into that number, and so should we still be looking at a $10 million reduction in the fourth quarter materials? And is your \u2013 and I think, Jim, you mentioned your longer-term targets are not including land sales, but I'm just curious whether you'll be giving us guidance on what the operating land sales will be in 2017? Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: So the \u2013 let me take that in two pieces. First of all, the materials guidance was for decline of $15 million in the third and fourth quarter. And so materials did come down $15 million. You are correct that the land sales is something that is variable, and so we didn't forecast that. And so the other biggest increase in that line was the land sale gains. And even without any land sale gains \u2013 and the timing of those are variable, so there may or may not be some in the fourth quarter, but even without the land sales gains we think we'll be below 70% OR in the fourth quarter. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: So looking into 2017 and beyond, we will update you on any and all land sales of which we are aware at the time, but granted it's difficult to forecast the timing of closing in a lot of cases, as with non-operating property. You pretty much have to \u2013 you have to close before you book the gain, and timing of closing can be uncertain. So when it happens we'll make sure we let you know, and if possible in advance. Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: And I will say that historically these haven't been very significant. In the last couple of years they've ranged between $10 million and $20 million for the whole year. So $28 million in one quarter is large, which is why we called it out. But certainly Mike and his folks, and Alan and his folks in the real estate side, are looking to monetize any surplus assets after they've analyzed it to make sure that it doesn't have other opportunities for us, now or perhaps in the future. Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: Okay. And did I hear you, it's below 70% excluding any land sales for fourth quarter for OR, is that right? Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Correct. Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then you mentioned some of the rerouting operations. What point do you decide \u2013 you mentioned you are keeping them open for now, contingent on whether volume will come back. At what point do you decide this is a structural or kind of a permanent business level on those lines, and decide to in fact close down those operations? How much OR improvement and synergy or efficiency can we get if you start closing down some of these reroutings that you've done to date? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: That's a judgment call. And we do abandon lines from time to time, on a fairly small scale. Every year we have line abandonments that we undertake. The savings \u2013 the additional savings would be rather modest from going from mothballing to outright abandonment, because for all intents and purposes we're not spending any money on a line that has been mothballed, as we went through earlier. Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much for the color. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research. Please proceed with your questions. Brian Adam Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Yes, hi, good morning. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Good morning. Brian Adam Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC : I just wanted to ask you about fuel surcharges and \u2013 within the contracts, to the extent you made progress during the quarter, transitioning from WTI to on-highway, and maybe just add on to that, to the extent that we do see a rise in fuel prices, how much incremental fuel costs might you have to absorb before you start to see those surcharges start kicking in? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Alan, why don't you take the question about the trend in the fuel surcharge mechanisms, and then Marta, maybe you can comment on the leverage aspect. Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: First and foremost our focus is on price, when we renegotiate contracts. And so we're not going to give up on price to change a fuel surcharge program. We have reduced our revenue that is tied to a WTI-based fuel surcharge from about 53% to slightly below 40% at this point. Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Okay. So with regard to the effect on the income statement, our fuel surcharges in the third quarter were down $46 million year-over-year, and our fuel expense line was down $40 million. You can see that that was a $6 million compression in the \u2013 in our operating income. Brian Adam Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Got it. I guess just as fuel may start to rise, how high would that need to go \u2013 I mean how much additional expense might you absorb before seeing a meaningful contribution from the fuel surcharge? Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: As we discussed in the past, our primary trigger in the merchandise area, which is largely where that 40% Alan mentioned still on WTI, the primary trigger point is 64. So as prices rise from where we are now, the closer they get to 64, each of those we will have that compression similar to what I described there. And so one way to look at it is to examine the change in WTI and OHD that we had, third quarter '15 to third quarter '16, and then see what that did to our fuel surcharges. And then you can extrapolate from there, depending on how you're forecasting oil prices to go up in the future. Brian Adam Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Got it. If I could just sneak one quick one then, just on pension, if you snap the line today, can you give us a look at what '17 looks like from a headwind or tailwind perspective? Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Well it's possible with -- if you snap the line today with interest rates where they are, we would have some increase in pension expense. But as you probably know, the interest rates for making those calculations are determined as of the end of the year. So once we see what interest rates are at December 31 we will get an estimate for our pension expense for next year, and we will provide that information to you on the January call. Brian Adam Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Got it. Thank you. Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: You're welcome. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your questions. Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks. Good morning. Just curious any thoughts or considerations with regard to weather, third quarter or fourth quarter impacts? Thanks. Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yeah, we \u2013 as you know, we had hurricane Matthew strike our southeast area on October 6, and fortunately we were able to get our network back up very quickly and provide service back to our customers. Really pleased about that, shows the resiliency of our network and really shows the planning and coordination that we put in, into place in advance. From a cost standpoint the impact is really immaterial, very, very minor. Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. Thanks. And just curious about the automotive segment as we look into 2017. I realize you're not providing any material guidance, but just thoughts and considerations as we move into next year in that segment? Thanks. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: What are you seeing there, Alan? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Well, we are closely aligned with North American vehicle production, and so as that goes into 2017, is kind of how our automotive volume goes. We're going to be closely monitoring the energy markets, we're going to closely monitor steel markets and retail inventory levels throughout the holiday season as we look into our volumes for 2017. Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, good morning. Thanks for getting me on the call here. Just to go back to the network initiatives, I know you said your velocity and services have been maintained and that's important to the network overall. But from an actual head count perspective, I think Mike you mentioned a few actions that were taken, but can you give us an actual impact on head count that these network initiatives on the rationalization of 1,000 miles, and what 1,500 would do \u2013 can you give us an impact on head count? Because if you look at the five-year plan, you're looking at 65% of the savings coming from comp and benefits. Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yeah. Well, just remember these are our secondary mainlines, so we don't have as many folks maintain those as our core mainlines, so that's why I talked about modest expense savings. But as we continue to rationalize, we will have some head count reduction, but it will not be at large, significant levels. But I'll just say that we are on track for the head count reductions we've got in our 2020 plan. Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then Alan, a quick one for you on intermodal. You talked about that, the modal competition from truck and taking share off the highway. Of course it's a very loose market right now, so how are you balancing that business and trying to get volume while maintaining price for the longer term, as you mentioned? And I guess, what's your expectation for the truck market and when it gets tighter? And what really drives that? Is it the ELD or is it something else? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: The key determinant for us and our growth has been an improved service product within the intermodal franchise, so that's how we're balancing, that's where \u2013 we and our customers are taking a long-term view of our capacity and the benefit of our service product, which is how we're focusing on price. With respect to the trucking market, we do anticipate that it tightens next year, potentially towards the latter half of the year with the implementation of ELDs and a normalization of inventory levels \u2013 that's one of the reasons I referenced that earlier \u2013 it'll probably be at a higher \u2013 the new norm is probably higher than it has been in the past, but we still think that a reduction in the inventory sales level is warranted, and would ultimately benefit volumes for us. Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks for your time. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your questions. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi, good morning and thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to follow up and wonder if you could add some color on the short-lining approach you guys are taking. Are you guys actually selling assets at this point, or just hiring a short-line operator to do some of the feeder moves, if you will? And is this \u2013 and is there any union implications that we should be worried about, as far as your expansion of that program going forward? Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.: So these are all leases that we've done. We've been doing leases for many years now, that's how we do the short-line program. And no, we work very well with our organizations on these leases and don't expect any impact there. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: The unions are okay with sort of shifting the work over to the lower cost operators? Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.: I didn't say that. I don't think that they're okay with it. They understand where we're going and they understand that it's not a big part of our network. It's very small, and typically we give them the opportunity to either go with the short line or come work with us, because they are great assets that we'd like to have, but it's their choice. So that's how we work through that. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. And then Marta, maybe just as a quick follow-up, I think you talked about a sub-70% OR in 4Q. That would imply a little bit of an acceleration on the rate of improvement on the margin line. Is there anything specific that you would point out to as driving that, or is that just a function of the moderation in volume against what you guys have already executed on the productivity side? Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Well, it includes a continuation of the efficiencies that Mike and his team have been able to get out. And one thing I will make sure everybody remembers is that the fourth quarter of last year had restructuring costs, and so that was one thing that elevated the operating ratio in the fourth quarter of last year. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: You're welcome. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please proceed with your question. Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities, Inc.: Thanks very much, and good morning. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Good morning. Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities, Inc.: I wonder if you could talk a little bit about how you balance service versus cost efficiency? That concept has come up a number of times. I noticed that the service composite has improved meaningfully on a year-over-year basis, but it's been pretty stable at 80% on a year-to-date basis. So just curious if that's a service level that you're consciously managing to, or is there room for that to continue to go higher even as you achieve productivity gains? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Well, we think we're at a pretty steady state in terms of composite metric right now. Which by the way we would characterize as a network performance metric. We are also measuring and managing to customer service metrics directly in each of our different lines of business. The two go hand-in-hand, we watch network performance metrics and in the field we manage to them. But at an enterprise level we're also obviously very focused on customer service metrics, direct measures of customer service as the customers see them. But our strategy overall is to reduce any and all spending. Wherever we see an opportunity to reduce spending, we will. However, we are going to seek to maintain a consistent level of customer service. That's the smart thing to do from a cost savings standpoint and it also is our platform for growth in the future. Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities, Inc.: Thank you. That's all from me. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Don Broughton with Avondale partners. Please proceed with your question. Donald Allen Broughton - Avondale Partners LLC : Good morning, everyone. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Good morning, Don. Donald Allen Broughton - Avondale Partners LLC : Most of the good questions have been taken, so I'll ask one of the housekeeping questions. Perhaps I missed it in your opening comments, Marta, but can you give us a little bit more insight on the tax rate? How sustainable is that, because that was certainly a good almost 300 basis points less than I was looking for? Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yes. We did have a under 35% tax rate in the quarter, which was lower than we had been guiding to, and that was primarily due to corporate-owned life insurance, which \u2013 when those returns come in, they are not taxable. And so that affects the effective tax rate in the quarter that those returns are booked. And then the other main reason was stock compensation. I mentioned those two in my prepared remarks, and there a couple of other items were smaller. One of them is tax credit. If you'll recall last year, Congress passed the extension of the tax credits in the fourth quarter of last year. So those were all booked in the fourth quarter. Since they extended them into 2016 when they did that, then we've been able to do those in each of the quarters it gives us a lower effective rate throughout the year rather than getting booked all at once. And then the last... Donald Allen Broughton - Avondale Partners LLC : Good to know. So we should expect an oscillation back towards a more normalized tax rate in fourth and ongoing quarters, then? Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: In the \u2013 in next year, a more normalized rate, but in the fourth quarter, we expect to stay at 36%, and then for the full year, as I mentioned, for the full year we think we'll be around 36%. Donald Allen Broughton - Avondale Partners LLC : Thank you so much. Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Jim Squires for closing comments. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Thank you for your time, everyone, this morning. This concludes our third quarter conference call. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.",

It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Katie Cook, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Ms. Cook. You may begin. Katie Cook : Thank you, Devon and good morning. Before we begin today's call, I would like to mention a few items. The slides of the presenters are available on our website at norfolksouthern.com in the Investor section, along with our non-GAAP reconciliations. Additionally, transcripts and downloads of today's call will be posted on our website. During this call, we may make certain forward-looking statements which are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and may differ materially from our actual results. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. Now, it is my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's Chairman, President and CEO, Jim Squires. James Squires : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Norfolk Southern's fourth quarter 2016 earnings call. With me today are NS's Chief Marketing Officer, Alan Shaw; and our Chief Operating Officer, Mike Wheeler; and our Chief Financial Officer, Marta Stewart. Our results summarized on slide four, are a testament to the dedication of our employees.  In 2016 their efforts were instrumental in the achievement of a record operating ratio for Norfolk Southern, as well as in meeting and exceeding our other financial and operational goals even in a tough economic climate. We have stayed focused on our core mission of safety, service and productivity while also driving positive changes throughout our organization. The significant progress we achieved in 2016 will power Norfolk Southern's success in delivering shareholder value both in the near and the long-term. For the fourth quarter, our discipline cost focus and successful initiatives to enhance efficiency, drove a 69.4 operating ratio, yielding a 510 basis point or 7% improvement compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. Even if you exclude last year's restructuring costs, the operating ratio improved by 310 basis points. Earnings per share for the quarter increased to $1.42, up 18% compared to the prior year period, as operating expenses came in 8% lower relative to a 1% decline in revenue. For the full year, we achieved a record 68.9 operating ratio, which was 370 basis points or 5% better than 2015. Earnings per share increased 10% to $5.62. In recognition of these results as well as the confidence we have in our strategy, the Board approved a $0.02 per share, or 3% dividend increase effective with our first quarter 2017 dividend payment. Slide five highlights the important components of our success in 2016. Our measure of network performance, the composite service metric increased to above 80 for the year versus 72 in 2015. We achieve this improved performance while accomplishing strategic network and organizational changes, such as the line and yard rationalizations that Mike described on our last call, as well as divisional and regional consolidations, the reorganization of our Pocahontas Land Corporation subsidiary and proactive management of capital spending. Asset utilization improved as we rationalized our locomotive fleet, improve the efficiency of our freight cars and increased utilization of other roadway assets. Simultaneously, we reduced our average employee count for the year by 7%, exceeding the 3% decline in carloads, and we also reduced overtime by 38%. In total, these initiatives generated 250 million of productivity savings for the year. We continue to invest in the health of the railroad, adapting to the economic environment by judiciously investing $1.9 billion in capital, well below our initial $2.1 billion plan. Over year-ago, we anticipated that Norfolk Southern would achieve a sub 70 operating ratio for 2016 and our team delivered, producing a record 68.9 OR. Likewise, we are committed to delivering on our longer-term targets and I'll update you on our strategic plan after Alan, Mike and Marta fill you in on the fourth quarter results. Alan? Alan Shaw : Thank you, Jim. And good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. On slide seven, I\u2019ll begin with an overview of our fourth quarter. Revenue of $2.5 billion was down 1% versus fourth quarter 2015. Due to strong intermodal growth our year-over-year grew for the first time this year in the fourth quarter. Both intermodal and coal revenue and volume increased sequentially over the third quarter. The Triple Crown restructuring continue to impact year-over-year comparisons, though to a lesser extent in the fourth quarter, an increase in export coal tonnage, softens the decline in coal volume and revenue. The utility volumes were negatively impacted by continued high stockpile levels. Merchandise revenue was affected by the ongoing decline of crude oil volume. Overall revenue per unit declined 3% in the fourth quarter as positive pricing was offset by mix associated with increased intermodal and decreased coal volume. Revenue per unit, excluding fuel, increased for both merchandise and intermodal, excluding Triple Crown. Our merchandise revenue on slide eight declined 1% to $1.5 billion as a result of a 3% decline in volume. Metals and construction volume benefited from increased steel shipments. Agriculture shipments grew due to increase soybean export and corn volumes. Declines in our chemicals market were driven by lower crude oil volume. Automotive volume was negatively impacted by the previously announced market share loss and flat year-over-year U.S. vehicle production in the fourth quarter. Paper and forest products volumes decline as a result of increased truck competition. Merchandise revenue per unit increased 2%, excluding fuel, reflecting some pricing games. Intermodal revenue as shown on slide nine increased 4% versus last year to $583 million, with a 7% increase in volume. Excluding the impact of the Triple Crown restructuring, intermodal volume and revenue were both up 10%. Improved service and increase consumer spending resulted in a 10% increase in our domestic intermodal volume versus a soft fourth quarter 2015. Market share gains, an increase import, and export shipments via East Coast ports drove an 8% increase in international volume. Despite rate pressure from the trucking industry, intermodal revenue per unit excluding Triple Crown and fuel increased 1% in the fourth quarter. Coal revenues declined 7% to $403 million in the fourth quarter with an overall 4% volume decline versus last year. Coal, revenue and volume increase sequentially for the second quarter in a row, primarily driven by fourth quarter export gains. We handle 16.9 million utility tons in the fourth quarter inline with our recent guidance of slightly below 17 million tons, but 10% below fourth quarter 2015 volumes, due to continued stockpile overhang from the mild 2015 to 2016 winter. We handled 4.7 million export tons in the fourth quarter, as demand for U.S. coals improved a mid tightening international supply and greatly increased seaborne pricing.  Coal revenue per unit, excluding fuel, declined 2% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year with positive price improvement offset by negative mix related to reduced volume to our longer haul southern utilities and increased export volume via Baltimore. Revenue per unit was up sequentially versus the third quarter. On slide 11, our full year 2016 revenue of $9.9 billion was 6% -- was down 6% versus the prior year with a 3% decline in volume and a 3% decrease in revenue per unit. Utility coal volume and revenue decreased sharply due to the impacts of mild winter weather in late 2015 and early 2016, and low natural gas prices which contributed to the buildup of stockpiles. These factors, coupled with global oversupply and weak seaborne coal prices in the export market led to an 18% decline in coal revenue. Fuel surcharge losses of $241 million were driven by the depressed oil prices. Quarterly declines lessen sequentially throughout the year as we left higher oil prices in 2015. And we anticipate that the recent rise in oil and diesel prices will lead to increased fuel surcharge revenues in 2017. The mid-November 2015 restructuring of our Triple Crown subsidiary also reduced revenue while improving our efficiency and productivity. Our 2016 pricing gains were offset by the negative mix impact of decreased coal volume and increased international intermodal volume producing a 1% decline in revenue per unit less fuel. Overall, 2016 was challenging for many of the markets we served with freight energy prices, weaker than anticipated economic growth, elevated inventory levels and increased truck capacity, all impacting our top-line performance. Although we saw stabilization as the second-half progressed leading to volume growth in the fourth quarter. Recent improvements in manufacturing and consumer spending, as well as overall expectations for a stronger 2017 economic environment provide upside potential for the year ahead. Within intermodal, a strong service product will continue to enable highway conversions and drive organic growth. We expect intermodal volumes and RPU to benefit from tightening capacity within the trucking market due to improved demand and increased regulation, particularly, later in the year.  We expect weather related normalization within utility coal as well as the market share gain to generate between 17 million and 19 million tons of utility coal per quarter in 2017. Our guidance is contingent upon normal weather conditions and natural gas prices consistent with the current forward curve. Export coal tonnage growth will be driven by tightening international coal supply and improved seaborne pricing, which should support incremental production. We expect to handle 3.5 million to 4.5 million export tons on a quarterly basis with a significant amount of volatility as evidenced by the benchmark price. Merchandise volume is predicted to be relatively flat in 2017. Pipeline development will negatively impact crude oil, natural gas liquids shipments. Automotive volume will be affected by extended retooling efforts at several NS served assembly plants and an expected 3% decline in U.S. vehicle production in 2017. Improving construction activity will benefit lumber, steel, cement and other housing related commodities. As in 2016, we will focus intensely on our pricing efforts. A solid pricing improvement seen over the past year will benefit our 2017 revenue. We are confident in our ability to leverage the value of our service product to attain pricing in excess of rail inflation. We are well-positioned for growth and have the flexibility to align resources and service capabilities with demand. We are steadfast in our commitment to meet evolving customer expectations which supports long-term growth and shareholder value.  I will now turn the presentation over to Mike for discussion of our operational performance. Michael Wheeler : Thank you, Alan. And good morning to our listeners. Our charge for 2016 was to provide a high level service product and aggressively pursue cost-cutting initiatives to drive productivity and efficiency. We accomplish this is evidenced by 2016 being the first year on record that we had both a service composite above 80 and an operating ratio below 70. And we believe we are well-positioned to leverage this momentum in 2017. As shown on slide 14, there were significant milestones achieved in 2016 that were key drivers of our success. The efforts towards driving fuel efficiency, train length and locomotive productivity all helped to drive a record operating ratio. We accomplished this, thanks to the hard work of our employees in executing our strategic plan. Moving to Safety on slide 15, while our entry ratio slightly increased in 2016, as compared to last year, our train accident rate improved 19% and as previously noted 2016 was our best year since the Conrail consolidation, even more encouraging, this improvement was across the board in transportation, engineering and mechanical. Turning to Service on slide 16. You see, we continued to execute at a very high level as evidenced by our service composite, train speed and terminal dwell while dwell was higher in the fourth quarter as compared to the same period last year. This was a result of an extended holiday shutdown due to the majority of our customers observing December 26 as a holiday. This allowed us to control costs without affecting customer service, which was a charge we successfully executed on for the entire year. Now on slide 17, our productivity initiatives coupled with our ability to keep the railroad operating at a high level continued to result in significant productivity savings. For the fourth quarter, as compared to the same period last year, we achieved a reduction in crew starts even with an increase in volume, which was driven in part by leveraging the capacity on our current trains. We also continued to improve on our overtime and train length although recruits were affected by an earlier start to winter weather. Together this resulted in continued improvement in employee productivity. For the full year 2016, we achieved our highest average train length on record which also aided a record fuel efficiency. Even with this continuous improvement in train length, our velocity has been roughly as high as our record levels of 2012 and 2013. In all, we had a very successful year and we are confident in our ability to continue this momentum in 2017. I now will turn it over to Marta to cover the financials. Marta Stewart : Thank you, Mike and good morning everyone. The fourth quarter results demonstrated our continued efforts on cost control and execution of strategic initiatives. Let\u2019s take a look at the financial details, starting with operating results on slide 19. While revenues were down slightly, operating expenses declined by $147 million or 8%, resulting in a 69.4 operating ratio for the quarter, a 510-basis-point-improvement over last year's fourth quarter. As you\u2019ll recall, the 2015 quarter included $49 million of restructuring costs, which added 200 basis points to OI. Slide 20 shows the expense reductions by income statement line-item, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year reductions in overall operating expenses. Now let\u2019s take a closer look at the components. Slide 21 depicts Purchase, Services and Rents which was down $41 million, or 9% year-over-year. The largest reduction was attributable to $21 million in the lower Triple Crown costs associated with the curtailment of those operations in the fourth quarter of 2015. Next were $12 million of lower Transportation and Engineering related purchase service cost. Finally, Equipment rents decreased by $3 million, notwithstanding the 2% increase in traffic volume. Slide 22 highlights the major drivers of the variance in compensation and benefits, which overall declined by $40 million or 6%. Reduced employment levels down over 2300 employees versus 2015, along with lower overtime resulted in $42 million of year-over-year savings. In addition, we lapped the lump sum payment of $13 million and $10 million of lower pension expense. These items were partially offset by increases in public accruals of $21 million, wage inflation $16 million and Health and Welfare rate increases of $12 million. The bonus variance was due to the fact that we had reversals of accruals in last year's fourth quarter. The wage and health and welfare inflationary increases were similar to the run rates experienced in the third quarter. As we look to 2017, we expect that total headcount will remain steady despite the anticipated increases in volumes that Alan described. However, higher health and welfare rates, particularly in our unionized programs, will result in approximately $65 million of additional expense and as a result, we expect all-in wage and medical cost inflation of about 5% versus the 3.5% we guided to and experienced in 2016. Slide 23 details our materials and other category, which decreased $38 million or 15%. Lower usage of locomotive and engineering materials totaled $16 million and travel costs were down by $6 million. Next is fuel expense as shown on slide 24. Mike described how we improved fuel efficiency and you can see that consumption declined by 6% despite the 2% increase in traffic volume. The improvement in efficiency completely offset the 8% increase in diesel fuel price versus the fourth quarter of 2015. Moving onto income taxes on slide 25, the effective rate for the quarter was 35.1% versus 31.1% in the fourth quarter of 2015. The effective rate was slightly below the forecasted 36% due to the effects of stock-based compensation. For 2017, we expect an effective income tax rate of approximately 37%. Summarizing our fourth quarter earnings on slide 26. Net income was $416 million, up 15% versus 2015 and diluted earnings per share were $1.42, up 18%. Restructuring costs affected 2015's net income by $31 million and EPS by $0.10. Full-year results are shown on slide 27. While revenues were 6% lower than 2015, our focus on cost control and improving asset utilization allowed us to lower expenses by 11%. The resulting income from railway operations of $3.1 billion was a 7% improvement, and as Jim noted, led to a record full year operating ratio of 68.9. Earnings per share were $5.62, an increase of 10% over the prior year. Slide 28 depicts our full-year cash flows. Cash from operations totaled $3 billion, amply covering capital spending and generating $1.1 billion in free cash flow. Returns to shareholders in 2016 totaled $1.5 billion through $700 million of dividends and $800 million in share repurchases. As Jim noted, our Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend to $0.61 a share, a 3% increase. On stock repurchases, we plan currently to continue at about a $200 million per-quarter run rate in 2017. Moving on to this year's capital budget on slide 29, we project total spending of $1.9 billion, roughly even with 2016. This budget is supportive of the growth areas Alan described while continuing to invest in our core assets. We have expansions planned at various terminals and infrastructure targeted at increasing capacity on our network to provide high service levels to support long-term growth. As you can see from the chart on the slide, the majority of our spending is on roadway and while at a dollar amount similar to the past few years, those dollars are stretching further in terms of units due to efficiency in our engineering forces. Locomotive capital includes new units, as well as the conversion of locomotives from DC to AC power. Thanks for your attention and I'll turn the program back to Jim. James Squires : Now, as promised, an update on our five-year strategic plan, which I conveyed in detail on last January's earnings call. You will recognize slide 31, which is the summary page of financial targets that I shared with you at that time. The employees of Norfolk Southern more than delivered on the 2016 targets. Additionally, we are on track to reach our 2020 targets, including pricing above rail inflation, a sub-65% operating ratio and double-digit compound annual growth in earnings per share. 2016 demonstrated our flexibility as we adapted our approach to capital spending to the evolving business environment. The same proactive approach will allow us to manage our capital spending to 17% of revenue, post the 2018 positive train control installation. Throughout, we will return significant capital to our shareholders by targeting a 33% dividend payout ratio, and will continue to imply share repurchases as a significant component of our capital allocation strategy. Our management's adaptability illustrated by our capital program applies to all aspects of the railroad. Volumes for NS and the industry did not develop for 2016 as expected, particularly in the energy markets. As a result, we were swift in taking actions to streamline operations and enhance service, bolstering our productivity and supporting growth in certain opportune markets. With this nimbleness and strong momentum, we are well-positioned to guide Norfolk Southern into the future. So with that in mind, I'll update you on key aspects of our long-range plan. Slide 33 highlights our expectations for each of our major revenue groups. Overall merchandise is anticipated to track the economy generally in line with GDP. The forecast for intermodal growth is about 4% on a compound annual basis as our strong service product positions us for growth. Coal is projected to increase in 2017 from our 2016 base as inventories and weather normalize, coupled with higher natural gas prices. It is then expected to decrease slightly from 2017 levels resulting in a modest 1% increase on a compound annual basis over the combined period. Slide 34 highlights some of the strategies that we have in place to support key resource flexibility as volumes develop. We will continue to proactively manage our workforce to right size our resources as demand evolves. We have established minimum employee levels at certain core locations where it has been more difficult to recruit new hires in the past. In addition, we have an active hiring model that we are continuing to enhance. On the locomotive side, we continue to invest in the reliability of our fleet. We will take receipt of 50 new locomotives beginning in late February with the majority of them coming online in March and April. In addition, our DC-AC rebuild program significantly accelerates in 2017. Now, moving on to slide 35 and expenses, we will build on 2016's productivity initiatives by for example, rationalizing our locomotive fleet by increasing our reliance on AC units. By increasing utilization and efficiency of our freight cars through a more homogeneous and flexible fleet composition and utilizing technology to optimize distribution of MTs, by continuing our line rationalization initiatives and by improving fuel efficiency. Last year we provided a framework for our overall $650 million five-year plan productivity target, as reflected on slide 36. With $250 million of productivity savings achieved in 2016 and $100 million targeted for 2017, I remain fully confident in our ability to deliver on our longer productivity objectives. At the beginning of our journey, we designed an approach that would be dynamic and flexible and 2016 certainly put that to the test. Our achievement of $250 million in productivity in 2016, clearly demonstrated that we would take the measures necessary to achieve that goal, creating new pass to savings when needed. We will apply that same flexibility over the next four years in order to align resources with demand, achieved 650 million in productivity savings, provide quality service and drive shareholder value. Wrapping up on Slide 37, at Norfolk Southern we know that the key to our success is world-class service that brings value to our customers, thereby supporting profitable growth that leverages our improving cost structure, culminating in exceptional returns to our shareholders. Thank you for your attention, and with that we will now open the line for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi Investment Research. Please proceed with your question. Chris Wetherbee : Hey, great. Thanks and good morning. Wanted to touch base a little bit on the operating ratio as you look out for 2017, so Jim you just kind of ran through some of the productivity opportunities that you see going forward and what you think that you can achieve in 2017. I just want to get a sense of maybe how that translates to an OR. You made nice progress this year. Should we expect similar type of stair-step progress in 2017 or any color would be helpful? Michael Wheeler : Good morning, Chris and thank you for your question. Before I answer it, I want to again emphasize how much we appreciate the contributions of our employees in 2016 to our outstanding performance. We are the efforts of our employees and we certainly recognize that. Now in 2016 we generated a record operating ratio. This morning, we outlined and reaffirmed our plan to achieve a sub-65 operating ratio by 2020. We expect to make progress toward that goal each year between now and then. And we expect to produce an operating ratio in 2017 below 2016s operating ratio. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. So improvement, but necessarily ready to quantify at this point? Michael Wheeler : Correct. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. And if I could just ask a follow-up. Just when I think about, sort of, the competitive environment in the Eastern half of the United States, we've heard over the course of last couple of weeks, a couple of sort of contracts moving back and forth and I think there is some regular jockeying of market share within you know, between railroads and also you know with the trucks. But wonder you get a sense or maybe how you view the competitive dynamic entering 2017? We haven't had a lot of volume growth. But volume is coming back. You see this changing or is this sort of normal or is it a little bit more hiked? Michael Wheeler : Certainly, we operate in a competitive environment so we face modal competition across the spectrum of our volumes. Let me turn it over to Alan for some more specific commentary on the environment today Alan Shaw : Yeah, Chris I would suggest that the in kind of the share shifted you\u2019ve seen recently are not unusual. Ultimately, our firm goal is to provide a service product that allows us to compete for business and one that our customer\u2019s value which will allow us to continue our efforts to move business from the highway to rail. As we saw markets stabilize in the second half of the year, we saw growth in the fourth quarter. And we expect that to continue in the 2017. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. Thanks for the time. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Malhotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Amit Malhotra : Yeah. Thanks so much. Just had quick question on some of the strategic discussions brewing in the Eastern rails over the last couple of weeks. I know you guys can\u2019t comment, you know, probably directly. But if you look at what occurred at Canadian Pacific under the previous managed team, there are number of significant inefficiencies taken out of the system. Things like, you know, the number of crew changes on certain routes, reductions in the number of pump yards and terminals. Just trying to understand you how much of an opportunity that is for Norfolk today, bearing in mind that you have already achieved so much in terms of productivity and whether there is maybe some scope to accelerate any of that to realize your OR targets even sooner? Thanks. James Squires : Good morning. We don\u2019t comment on market rumors. We are single-mindedly focused on driving shareholder value through successful execution of our strategic plan, which as you know does include significant additional productivity improvements. We view \u2013 having achieved 250 million in productivity in 2016, we've set a goal of 100 million in productivity for 2017. We believe that number is achievable, realistic and sustainable and will allow us to continue providing an excellent level of customer service. If we discover additional productivity opportunities we will certainly go after them. Amit Malhotra : Okay. Well, I thought I tried to ask that question anyways, I appreciate the answer. Let me ask you one maybe, you can answer a little bit more directly as related to your comments about being more dynamic and flexible like. I maybe wrong, but I feel like you're really talking about maybe making the cost structure a little bit more dynamic and flexible, so you can flex down and flex up as volumes change. First of all, is that correct? And second of all, I guess with that imply that essentially your cost structure is in fact becoming more variable, which may impact you know perspective incremental margins and where do you think those incremental margins could go under this maybe new dynamic and flexible cost structure? Thank you. James Squires : We certainly demonstrated our flexibility and adaptability in changing business conditions in 2016 by producing record results despite some headwinds from the economy. And we will continue to adhere to that very flexible and adaptable approach going forward, particularly in our use of our resources. Let me turn it over to Mike to talk about some of the resource strategies we have in place for 2017 and then maybe Marta can comment on the incremental margin question. Michael Wheeler : Sure, Jim. Well, we stay in close contact with marketing and they let us know what's going on out the marketplace and on our volumes. And we are quick to adapt to whether business is going up to make sure we handle that or we\u2019re seeing areas that are that are not coming online like we thought. We're going to take the cost out. We\u2019re very flexible on that. On the resource side, two big drivers are locomotives. We continue to look at rationalizing our locomotive fleet. We\u2019ve got a lot of good plans in place. We still have some search units out there. So we\u2019re comfortable that we can handle any upside as well. But we continue to look at what we can take out and reduce costs on the locomotive fleet. On the resource side of manpower, we have committed to making sure we protect the train crews to ensure that that we have the service product we need and again going back to our conversations with marketing, we're very flexible on what\u2019s happening with what they are telling us. On the rest of the railroad, we continue to look at every opportunity where we can take cost out but still protect safety and service. James Squires : Marta, would you address the question about incremental margin? Marta Stewart : Yes. Alan described how we expect some growth in 2017. We do expect to have very good incremental margins on all of that business. As you may know, our incremental margins depend on where, which segment of our business they come in. All of them, as I said, had good margin. The hierarchy, though, as we had the highest incremental margins on merchandise because those travel largely on existing trends and don't have too many incremental variable cost. Next is coal and then intermodal as it has the highest proportion variable cost. Amit Malhotra : But this is it safe to say that on a blended basis at least incremental margin should at least be $0.50 of every incremental revenue dollars you drop to the bottom line. Is that a good number on the blended basis? Marta Stewart : We haven\u2019t guided to a specific number, but we do expect very good incremental margins on all of our business. Amit Malhotra : Okay. Great, thanks for taking my question congrats on a good quarter. Marta Stewart : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Danny Schuster : Hi good morning. This is Danny Schuster on for Allison. Thank you for taking our questions this morning. So we wanted to dig in a little bit to coal. You know you're now guiding to kind of a Cold growth CAGR of 1% over the next few years with a step up this year and a deceleration thereafter. So we just wanted to get a sense. Are you \u2013 does this kind of imply that you are expecting something like a 4% or 5% step up this year and kind of benefit a decelerate - a decline from there. And then from there we\u2019d love to dig in a little bit to see if we can get a little bit more color on what the split across your different coal businesses are? Thank you. James Squires : Sure. Alan provided some specific guidance with respect to our coal volumes as projected in 2017. Alan, why don\u2019t you go back over that and then provide a little bit of additional commentary. Alan Shaw : Danny. We talked about utility coal volumes 17 to 19 million tons per quarter for the year dependent upon normalized weather patterns and natural gas prices following the forward curve. And note that today natural gas prices are about a dollar per million BTU above where they were this time last year. And as you're aware, and from February to May of last year, natural gas was below $2 a million BTU. So that in and of itself will provide more support for our coal-fired utility customers and would provide year-over-year growth in our coal markets. We've also talked about export coal volumes between 3.5 million to 4.5 million tons quarterly resulting from improved seaborne pricing and demand for US coals. There's a lot of volatility in that. As you have seen, the benchmark pricing for hard coke and coal shift from $92.50 a metric ton in the third quarter up to $285 a metric ton in the first quarter and then the latest spot price was about $185 a metric ton. So that is going to be one that we are watching closely and we'll be sure to update our outlook for that on our next call. Danny Schuster : Okay. Great. That's very helpful. And then within utility coal, how should we think about the mix between your Southern utility customer base and Northern utility customer base and is there a length-of-haul mix we should be thinking about associated with the growth within that line this year? Thank you. Alan Shaw : In the fourth quarter, we saw a somewhat slight mix shift from our Southern utility base to our Northern utility base. We expect that to continue in 2017 as a result of stockpiles generally being lower in the North right now than they are in the South. Danny Schuster : Okay. So would that infer kind of a negative RPU mix just from that phenomenon? Alan Shaw : Danny, generally, our Southern utility shipments have a longer life of haul. Danny Schuster : Great, great. That's very helpful. Well, thank you very much for my questions. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Ravi Shanker : Good morning. So you've said that you are expecting RPU of about 2.5% through 2020 versus CPI of 2.2%. That's closed a little bit from your prior guidance. And also just wanted to check if that is going to be a similar gap for 2017 just given some of Marta's comments on labor seemed like inflation could be a little higher for 2017. James Squires : Let's talk about the rejected RPU trend in the five year plan going forward first. Alan, would you take that one? Alan Shaw : Yes, absolutely. We are going to continue to price above rail inflation. We are committed to doing that. We are confident in our ability to leverage the value of our service product, so you will continue to hear us talk about that. We had a lot of negative mix shifts in 2016 as we talked about the declines in utility coal and the declines in crude oil and the declines in natural gas liquids and frac sand. So we have started to see stabilization on that front; it's one of the reasons our volumes grew in the fourth quarter and we expect that stabilization and some improvement in truck and energy markets to manifest itself into growth in RPU in 2017. Ravi Shanker : Got it. And as a follow-up, I apologize if I missed this, but did you give us your natural gas price assumptions for 2017 and through 2020? I just wanted to see where that is and how much that will help move the needle on coal for you. Alan Shaw : Yes, we talked about paying very close attention to the forward curve; that's what we are looking at now. Right now, that's about $1.20 above gas prices that we experienced in the first and second quarters of last year. Ravi Shanker : Got it. Is there a breakeven level that you would like to see before your coal volumes start to really move? Alan Shaw : Well, we saw coal dispatch mix improve relative to natural gas in the fourth quarter, particularly in December as natural gas prices got up into $3.50. We started to see support for some of our more efficient plants at $3 natural gas and maybe even a little bit lower. It's dependent upon sourcing patterns. It depends on weather patterns. The higher the better, obviously, but we are already seeing support for our coal franchise at $3.20 natural gas. Ravi Shanker : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors with the Susquehanna Financial Group. Please proceed with your question. Bascome Majors : Yeah. Good morning. Can you update us on how much of your book of business is now including fuel surcharge mechanisms that are still below that recovery threshold and remind us how far those are from being in the money where you start to get rising revenues as fuel prices rise? James Squires : Bascome, we are now at about 40% of our fuel surcharge revenue is tied to WTI. That is generally out of the money. The rest of it is generally tied to on-highway diesel or is in a tariff that doesn't have a fuel surcharge program and on-highway diesel has a strike price that is on average close to where we are now. Bascome Majors : Okay. So maybe one time this to Marta, you know, how much of a bottom line or margin drag from diesel you begin in 2017 outlook as we see higher fuel prices on this portion of your business, but you aren\u2019t seeing your revenue offset? Marta Stewart : Well, as you saw in our 2016 results, we had of course several going the other way, but in our 2016 result, you saw both in the fourth quarter and in the year that our few revenues were down. For the full year you could see that the reduction in fuel \u2013 the fuel expense line about equal the reduction of fuel surcharge revenue. So looking forward to 2017, as Alan has already mentioning and you noted, the fuel curve is up and indeed through January, we are \u2013 oil prices are quite a bit higher than they were in the first quarter of last year. So as long as we stay below $64 a barrel and be the curve even though now its projecting to be up, it\u2019s not expected to go currently above that. So we will expect to see increase, less of an increase in our fuel surcharge revenue than we have in fuel expense. However, I would note that we do not expected to have a significant effect on our operating income where you will see it have more effect will be on the operating ratio simply because of the math because the numerator and the denominator will be moving by similar numbers. James Squires : I\u2019ll add that generally higher energy prices are going to lift many of the markets we serve and expand the value proposition of rail relative to trucks. So it\u2019s not just the fuel surcharge discussion, it will drive volume growth and pricing ability for us. Bascome Majors : I appreciate the comments you may answer. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Ken Hoexter : Hey, great. Good morning, and congrats on a record OR and good to see that the progress continue, but I want to focus on that Jim if we can because, want to get your thoughts on the 100 million in savings and perhaps define what's in there and understand, kind of where you're focused on this year and see the ramp? Last year you raise that target up to 250; see what the possibility of to improve on that? And is it as simple as taking that 100 million and saying that's 60 basis points of improvement, so you're really targeting something like a 68 OR this year or would you suggest there's more to it? James Squires : So as I went through Ken, we produce 250 million in productivity savings in 2016 and a record operating ratio for the full year. Of that 250 was above our original projection of our productivity savings in 2016. In 2017, we\u2019re targeting a $100 million in additional productivity savings. That number we view as realistic, achievable, and sustainable even while we run our network at a high service level. Again, if we see additional opportunities for productivity savings, just as we did in 2016, we will go after them, and we could see them in all of the areas in which we achieve productivity savings in 2016. Ken Hoexter : I got that but that wasn\u2019t \u2013 I understand that\u2019s what you said before. I just want to try and understand what\u2019s in there. Last year, you talked about the coal network shutting down some yards integrating divisions. Can you talk to us about what's in the target so we can understand where upside leverage can come from like you saw last year? James Squires : Sure. We\u2019re going to continue to push on all of those areas in which we achieved productivity savings in 2016. Mike, why don\u2019t you comment? Mike Wheeler : Yeah. It\u2019s across the board like Jim notes. First of all, it\u2019s in our fleet rationalization, both the locomotives that we talked about continuing to make sure we are getting the most out of those assets and looking at ways to take locomotives out of the fleet even though we\u2019re handling greater volumes. On the freight car fleet, while we are bringing some new freight cars online, overall net, we\u2019re planning on reducing the size of the fleet. That's a fleet rationalization still being able to protect our customer service. Continue to look at ways to take costs out of the branch lines without hurting service. Fuel efficiency, we\u2019ve got a big push on fuel efficiency, both from technology and the locomotive productivity that we talked about. And the last thing is we continue to look at optimizing our training plan, whether it's to improve customer service or to get productivity in the network. We do that every day and all of those things are baked into that $100 million. Ken Hoexter : Wonderful and just a cleanup to Alan, you mentioned on coal inventory, it came off a bit. Can you talked about where they are now? Alan Shaw : Yeah, coal inventories are still elevated above target. They are at about 86 days at this point. I would say target is probably closer to 60 days. Importantly, they come down about 20 days since their high of last year. The South is about at 82 days, North is about 90 days. The South has declined a little bit more as of recent. And importantly PJM power pricing is up about 15% or was up about 15% in December which has really supported coal burn and coal deliveries in that area. Ken Hoexter : Okay. Appreciate the time. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Brian Ossenbeck : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So Alan just going back to the mix impact for second, obviously it was negative for the year, if you just look at RPU less fuel when you talked about \u2013 also some of the reasons why the mix within export coal length of haul. Just want to circle back to confirm why - might be positive or least improving into next year for the intermodal being one of the \u2013 the only three big segments to really grow. It sounds like you still have some more export coal to go? And maybe you can factor in how you see auto into that as well. I think you mentioned there was kind of track production which was we thought was a 3% decline or so? Alan Shaw : Yeah, we do believe our automotive franchise will declines with the with U.S. automotive production declining 3% and then there are some specific plans that we serve that are taking some retooling. Importantly, we are continuing to get price. We are pricing above real inflation that would benefit 2017. We're going to see growth in our coal network, which as you are aware put pressure on our RPU in 2016. And we're going to continue to price in our intermodal network reflecting the value of our service product. So we see growth in RPU. Brian Ossenbeck : Okay. Got it. So it sounds like some of the buckets are changing it mostly from -- from price. I guess the other factor just to follow-up on overall volume in for next to the outlook. How do you see FX playing into the strength of the dollar and some of you markets it has some pretty good numbers in MetCon. The dollars off a bit, but I was wondering how much you think that needs to move and you sustainably moving before you\u2019d see some relief in some of those areas has been pressured for the last couple -- couple of years? Alan Shaw : Well, our imports were out more than our exports and 2016 resulted in part from the foreign-exchange issues. You talked about our metals and construction. Our steel customers are feeling pretty positive, right now. And they're looking for growth. Steel prices are up year-over-year, capacity factors are up year-over-year. Our exports we think are going to be supported, at least in the near-term by export coal volumes. So we're going to closely watch the dollar. It impacts trade and we\u2019re heavily tied to trade. There are some things going on that are going to support international volumes for us, at least in the near term. Brian Ossenbeck : Okay. Thanks for taking my call. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of time of Thomas Wadewitz with UBS Securities. Please proceed with your question. Thomas Wadewitz : Yeah. Good morning. I wanted to ask you to Alan a little bit about price. I think you had some commentary on pricing. But what would you see the progression has been if you look at 2016 and say that you know, did you see much change in pricing through the year. I think some market share wins in the intermodal and coal, you know, beg the question of whether you are being a little more aggressive on certain pieces of business? So you know, if you want to comment on that, but also just kind of the market dynamic overall, will you start change in pricing and what you think on '17, whether you just need to see truck market siding a bit that will be key driver or just how you look on the pricing overall and then, in particular related to some of the wins you had on intermodal and coal? Thanks. James Squires : We are committed to price and above rail inflation. I\u2019m completely confident in the ability of our team to continue to deliver a strong service product and the ability of our team to price to the value of that service product. But there is anywhere we\u2019re aggressive in 2016 it was on our service product. Our pricing throughout the year was consistently above rail inflation. We saw our trucking markets start to tighten in the fourth quarter, some of our other markets stabilize in energy prices moved up, which allowed us to grow in the fourth quarter. And we expect that momentum to continue into 2017. Alan Shaw : Tom, I too would like to emphasize our commitment to pricing above rail inflation, based on an excellent service product. Thomas Wadewitz : Okay. Yeah, great. What about this thought in terms of just 2017, 2018 kind of I guessed the pass on pricing, is it reasonable to say that this is just at the end of the day, you\u2019re primarily going to be driven by capacity and demand in the market? So if we really see that you know truck spot market tightening and pricing rising, that that will help you accelerate pricing and if you do see some better volume overall on rail through '17, that is it reasonable defeated pricing accelerate along with that? James Squires : The key to higher prices in our view is excellent service. And we operate in a competitive marketplace, we believe we provide an outstanding service and our goal is to obtain above rail inflation pricing going forward. Thomas Wadewitz : All right. Okay Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott Group : Hey, Thanks, morning everyone. James Squires : Morning. Scott Group : So I know you don't have earnings guidance for this year but you\u2019ve got multiyear guidance of double-digit earnings growth. If coal is going to be up high-single low-double-digits this year and then down in the subsequent years. Is there a reason why we shouldn't have double-digit earnings growth this year? Is there something that we need to consider? And then just along those lines, Marta, you gave us last year just very helpful kind of margin commentary on the coming quarter, any thoughts on first quarter operating ratio just given the tough comp versus year ago. James Squires : Let me go back over Scott first our overall outlook. We outlined and reaffirmed our plan to get to a sub-65 operating ratio by 2020. And we expect to make progress each year toward that goal. And therefore we expect to post an operating ratio in 2017 that is below 2016\u2019s full year operating ratio, and we do not give quarterly guidance. Scott Group : But is there anything that you would want us to consider in our models if this is a normal year of productivity and it's the one year we expect coal volume growth and you have a multi-year double-digit earnings growth expectation. It would seem that this should be year-over-year at least double-digit maybe even above trend. Is there something you want us to contemplate and why it might not be that way? James Squires : Certainly coal volume above the range that we have projected would provide additional upside to our plan. Scott Group : Okay. And then Alan just on the coal yields, so CSX reported a pretty meaningful sequential increase in coal yields in the fourth quarter and you guys have just a small increase. Can you just walk us through how your export coal pricing works? Is there a reason why you're not going to see that bump or is it more that the way you guys price will see that bump more or so in the first quarter than what we saw in the fourth quarter? Alan Shaw : Yes, Scott we talked on the third quarter call about how we felt like our growth in export volumes in the fourth quarter would come at the lower length of our Baltimore business as opposed to Lambert's Point and in fact, you know, that's exactly what happened. Our growth in the fourth quarter in export volumes was associated with Baltimore, not Lambert's Point. And so as a result, we had a negative mix with our export coal RPUs. We looked at our pricing on export in the fourth quarter as we said we would. We told you we would do it in the first quarter, which we did and then we are closely monitoring the benchmark price and the demand going forward. Scott Group : Maybe a better way to ask it, do you think you'll see coal revenue per car sequentially higher or lower in the first quarter than the fourth? Alan Shaw : I think ultimately that's going to depend upon mix. I talked a little bit about how our volumes in the North would probably increase at a higher rate than our volumes in the South, which will put pressure on our coal RPU, but offsetting that is going to be some strong pricing in our export volumes. Scott Group : Okay. All right, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays Capital. Please proceed with your questions. Brandon Oglenski : Good morning, everyone and thanks for getting me in. So Jim, I just want to come back to the structural opportunity on the cost structure because you guys have been running consistently with let's call it a 27%, 28% OR on labor costs. A lot of the rest of the industry is now closer to 20% on a labor OR. And when I look at your results for the past decade, you have run with headcount between 28,000 and 30,000 folks and your productivity, and sorry I am getting nerdy here, but I do like to quantify this stuff -- I think your productivity is about 13 million GTMs per head per year right now. CSX, which is a similar size network, arguably maybe little a bit bigger, running 15 million GTMs per head. Can you talk about -- is there something structural on the network where you can let attrition take headcount down and grow volume and grow productivity on the labor line because, as we look at it and I think as a lot of investors look at it, that's a big opportunity for you guys going forward? James Squires : We certainly made progress on labor productivity in 2016. That was a key driver of our $250 million in productivity savings. In 2017, as we have been through, we are targeting an additional $100 million in productivity savings, a number that we view as sustainable and a component of that will be additional labor savings. We have guided to basically flat headcount for the full-year 2017. We think that's a level of human resources that will allow us to continue driving productivity and serve as a foundation for growth as well. Brandon Oglenski : But is there anything in the network, Jim, that you look at that you think going forward, hey, we need to restructure the way we are looking at the world because we used to be more coal-focused and commodity-focused and now we want to be a little bit more nimble around intermodal? Is there something in the terminal infrastructure where you could see attrition rates, not necessarily layoffs or reductions, but really reducing the size of the employee base going forward relative to revenue? James Squires : In 2016, we demonstrated our nimbleness and our agility in responding to business conditions with respect to the labor resource, as well as otherwise and we have additional opportunities going forward as well. Labor productivity, specifically, is the largest component of our overall $650 million by 2020 and we will continue to work on that. Brandon Oglenski : Okay. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Justin Long : Thanks. Good morning and I wanted to ask about intermodal. First, could you give us some sense for the level of intermodal volume growth you are expecting in 2017 and, second, I know you guided for consolidated pricing above inflation, but do you think above inflation pricing is achievable within intermodal this year? James Squires : As we've been through our goal and our plan is to produce above rail inflation pricing for the duration of the plan period based on excellent customer service. Now let me ask Alan to comment specifically on the dynamics within the intermodal sector. Alan Shaw : Sure. Hey, Justin, truck capacity, while it has tightened, is still relatively loose, particular compared to where we were in 2014. So we think that as truck capacity tightens, particularly towards the second half of the year, then we are going to start to see more and more intermodal growth. So Jim had talked about 4% CAGR on intermodal growth over our next four years and we think that's within the ballpark of where we will be in 2017 and that's going to support that tightening truck market and reduced inventory levels will support more pricing in 2017. Justin Long : Okay. That's helpful. But just to clarify, you do feel like intermodal pricing can be above rail inflation this year? James Squires : For the planned period going forward, we will certainly strive for above rail inflation pricing based on our excellent service. Justin Long : Okay. Secondly, sticking on intermodal, I wanted to ask about the progression of intermodal margins over the course of the longer-term strategic plan. Does that longer term outlook assume that intermodal margins improve to the point where they are inline with consolidated averages at some point before 2020? And if so, what's a realistic timeframe to think about when this can occur? James Squires : Marta, why don\u2019t you go back over the basic incremental margin characteristics of each of the businesses and then address the question with regards to intermodal? Marta Stewart : All right. Justin, intermodal, although I mentioned earlier that it is third in a hierarchy of incremental margins. It is still very good incremental margins and to answer your specific question, we definitely expect improving intermodal margins throughout the four year plan period that Jim described. Justin Long : Okay. But you're not willing to say if those intermodal margins will be on par with consolidated margins at some point over the plan? Marta Stewart : We\u2019ve never split our incremental margin numbers between the three. Justin Long : Okay. I'll leave it at that. I appreciate the time today. Marta Stewart : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen Securities. Please proceed with your question. Jason Seidl : Thank you, operator. Hey Jim, hey team. Real quickly looking out at your expected CAGR on the intermodal side, you said international growth above GDP. Is there anything built-in for continued share shifts of the west coast ports and some of the build out to some the eastern ports? James Squires : Alan, why don\u2019t you take that one? Alan Shaw : Sure Jason that has been a support for our volumes over the last couple of years. It\u2019s been a continuing trend. We look for it to continue moving forward. But we\u2019re looking at GDP plus growth within the international space. There won't be a big hockey-stick there. We\u2019re looking for sustainable organic growth. Jason Seidl : Okay. So there's a little bit built in there, but probably not too much that we\u2019ve seen like see in the past couple of years? A - Alan Shaw Correct. Jason Seidl : Okay. That\u2019s all I have. Guys, appreciate the time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Hartford with Robert W Baird. Please proceed with your question. Ben Hartford : Thanks. I guess I\u2019ll just build on that last point Alan on the intermodal side \u2013 international intermodal side specifically. You had mentioned, you had emphasized organic. So when we think about some of the rhetoric around trade exiting TPP et cetera. Perhaps if you could expound upon the opportunity from share shift in the context of perhaps trade \u2013 rising trade protectionism over that for your period and to what degree do you think that might present risk to your ability to grow international intermodal above GDP over the next four years? Thanks. James Squires : Yes, if there were something that impacted international trade that would certainly have an impact on our business levels, and note that the impact on the headwinds that we faced in 2016 around inventory levels seem to be normalizing. Trucking markets seeing to be firmament and as a result we saw growth in the fourth quarter. So there's going to be puts and takes, but clearly we\u2019re watching anything that would impact international trade. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Vernon with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. David Vernon : Hi, good morning and thanks for taking the question. Maybe just a Marta if you could talk a little bit about what we should expect about the cadence for the inflation, other step-up in inflation for next year. I think you got this from the closer to a 5% than the 3.5% we saw in the current year. Marta Stewart : Yes, and that\u2019s 5% David is specifically just to the comp and benefit line. David Vernon : Yes. Marta Stewart : For the remaining items in our income statement those lines increase inflationary, but just general economic inflation, so at a lower rate than 5%. David Vernon : Okay. And then as far as kind of the cadence of how that should be coming in it, is there anything we should be thinking about in terms of incentive comp or specific timing of payments or things like that. Marta Stewart : Yes. For generally speaking that\u2019s a good point for you to bring up. Generally speaking the comp line is weighted somewhat to the first quarter of the year and that is because the incentive comps as you mentioned. So if you look at the cadence last year of the comp that should be a general guideline. With regard to the health and welfare inflation, those new rates for the industry did start on January 1. David Vernon : Okay, thanks. And then Mike maybe just a question for you. The fuel productivity got like to the all-time high in the winter quarter, like a 5% jump. I'm just wondering like what is it that\u2019s driving that? Is it some sort of change in locomotive fleet, I know you\u2019ve dozen things around, line rationalization and you mentioned also something about maybe holiday timing kind of running that a little lighter. Is this a new run rate from which we should be building our expectations until productivity, was there and is there - can you talk a little bit about what\u2019s driving the significant improvement in that particular metric in terms of the fuel consumption? Michael Wheeler : Sure. So the biggest driver is the fact that we continue to reduce the locomotive fleet that is a big push there. In addition, we've got a lot technologies, a fuel management technology that we put out there and really leveraging that. And then additionally, we really focused on fuel shutdown compliance, other rules that we put on the operations to make sure that we are getting the best fuel efficiency. All those pieces go into our record, fuel efficiency and we see more opportunity going forward this year as well. David Vernon : So it just sounds like its a little bit execution in some of the prior investment around the fuel technology. Is there is nothing structural in terms of the change in mix of the fleet range with that? Michael Wheeler : No, I don\u2019t think. Well structurally yeah, the reduced fleet, we told you last year about how much of yard and local fleets - yard and local engines that we pulled out of the fleet and still was able to protect service that was a big driver of that. We're continuing to look at that. So that's the structural pieces is reducing our yard and local fleet and then being able to handle increasing gross tone miles with kind of the current fleet gives you even more productivity. So that's the structural piece, in addition to all the technology and execution that we focus on. David Vernon : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please proceed with your question. Cherilyn Radbourne : Thanks very much and good morning. So the dividend increase was a bit of surprise to me anyway. Can you talk a little bit about your comfort level for being above your long-term target payout ratio for period of time and whether you think there might be room for that payout target to increase? James Squires : Let me begin by saying that shareholder distributions including dividends and regular dividend increases are a major component of our capital allocation strategy. And I'll turn it over to Marta to discuss your payout ratio question Marta Stewart : Absolutely. We definitely believe as Jim said that the shareholder should benefit as the company's profitability improved and board did raised the dividend by about 3%. As you mentioned, we have a long-term payout target of 33%. The board believes that we can provide modest dividend increases as we managed that payout ratio to that one-third target. As you recall, last year had a 46% target, so even with this increase, we are moderating the payout in total. Cherilyn Radbourne : Okay, but 33 remains the long-term target? Marta Stewart : Yes, that\u2019s correct. Cherilyn Radbourne : That\u2019s all for me. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Walter Spracklin : Yeah. Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. So I just wanted to focus a little bit, perhaps its for Marta on the comp and benefit line, I know, Jim you mentioned that there was a 100 million in a normal year you would have most of that productivity savings coming from the comp and benefit or the labor line. With the 5% increase, all in that you're pointing to and yes on flat headcount, I'm just wondering if the 100 million this year is factoring in perhaps a much lower component of labor productivity than in the years over your forecast period, am I right in saying that for this year? Marta Stewart : Generally speaking, the ratios of reductions are similar to the full plan. So, Jim showed in the 650 million, roughly 65% of that is comp and benefits and that percentage holds true for the 100 million. So we do expect the lion share of the $100 million of productivity improvement to come in the comp line. And one of the things we mentioned, I think Mike and I both mentioned with the \u2013 are keeping the headcount level but managing extra volumes there some productivity there. In addition to just looking at the headcount, we also have productivity in that line and overtime and recruit and extra boards, so there's other specific areas other than just account that also lead to productivity in the comp line. Walter Spracklin : So when we look at that line, we should offset the 5% increase with changes in other components of that line item being like you said overtime and so on so it's not necessarily the last year's labor times 5% higher average, average comp, we should also reflected in for overtime another aspects and do you have any sense of order of magnitude? If that's the case what impact that would be on the comp and benefit line in 2017, everything excluding the 5% and the flat labor account that you'd already mentioned? Marta Stewart : How you describe it is just the right way to look at. You\u2019re going to look at within those components. You talked \u2013 look at the compensation benefits that we had last year. We do have the inflationary growth, which is one component and then separate from that we have the productivity which will then occur the other way. Walter Spracklin : But order of magnitude not\u2026 Marta Stewart : Order of magnitude is about the same percentage in the year as we guided to for the entire five-year period. It is the lion share of the $100 of productivity. Walter Spracklin : Okay. Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for fitting me in and I\u2019ll just ask one. Could you please elaborate on slide 33, the long-term outlook the expected pipeline related headwinds in crude oil and natural gas liquids pertaining to the merchandise segment? And then if you could, kind of, hone in on your chemical segment view for 17 any additional color. Thanks. James Squires : Scott, that is directly related to the Dakota Access pipeline and Mariner East 2 pipeline. Dakota Access will impact blocking crude to the East Coast, although will still participate in some heavy Canadian crude. And the Mariner East will impact our NGO shipments out of Utica and Marshallese. Scott Schneeberger : Thanks very much. James Squires : You are welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Jeff Kauffman with Aegis Capital. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Kauffman : Thank you very much and congratulations. Most of my questions have been answered. Marta, can I focus a little bit on the pension component of the labor cost increase? You mentioned pension to become a tailwind versus a headwind. I know there was a sharp up-tick in rates post-election. When was your pension expense re-leveled and what does that look like in terms of the tailwind for 2017? Marta Stewart : So our pension expense, we think for 2017, to answer your last question first, we think it\u2019s going to about flat with 2016. And you are correct that the interest rate change would push that up a little bit. However, we also had asset gain in the plan. So net-net for 2017 we see pension expense staying relatively even. Jeff Kauffman : Okay. And just a quick follow-up, if I run the utility coal and export coal numbers that you provided for 2017. It looks like we are going to be up double-digit in both of those areas. Number one, am I thinking through that right in terms of 2017 volume? And number two can I assume that\u2019s going to be more heavily weighted in the first two quarters of the year? James Squires : I am not seeing the double-digit growth in export coal when the guidance that we provided. Jeff Kauffman : Okay. But the utility side? James Squires : The utility side, you know what we\u2019ve given you the guidance that\u2019s our best look right now. Jeff Kauffman : Okay. All right, well, thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rick Paterson with Loop Capital. Please proceed with your question. Rick Paterson : Thank you. Good morning. Could you please update us on the number of furloughed train crews and stored locomotives? And with regard to crews, when you recall furloughed employees, what percentage typically come back? I would imagine that percentage also erodes over time as we move further away from furloughed dates. How should we think about that? James Squires : Yes. So on the furlough, we still have right around 100 employees furloughed on the T&E side and it's primarily in the coalfields, though if there is continued upswing in coal, we could handle that, but it's down to about 100. We started recalling them in the middle of last year across the network to handle the sequential volume increase and protect service, so we did that. And on the recalls, you are right. When we first start out, we get up into the high 90% recall rate when we recall furloughs and the longer it goes, it starts declining after that. Although with some of the things we've put in place with our extra boards over the last year, overall, we got a higher return rate, which we are real pleased with. On the locomotive side, we still have about 350 locomotives stored available to us. Rick Paterson : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research. Please proceed with your questions. Brian Konigsberg : Thank you. Appreciate you fitting me in. It's been a long call; a lot of questions have been answered. I have a couple small ones. Marta, actually you mentioned in response to the pension question asset gains. Is that asset gains within the pension plan, or are you expecting to have asset sales in '17 elsewhere within the network itself? Marta Stewart : That was within the pension plan that I was describing. Brian Konigsberg : Okay. With the productivity initiatives going on, you did have an asset sale in '16. Would you anticipate some assets to break loose as you work through rationalization of the network? Marta Stewart : Our real estate department is always taking a look at where we have assets that we can sell. We especially described in the third quarter where we had a large operating asset sale. In 2017, they will continue to look at it. As you know, looking over the last 3 years, that number can be somewhat variable, but 2 years before that, it was smaller, varying $10 million to $20 million and this year was a little bit higher, over $30 million. So that will depend on the properties that they come up with. Alan, do you have anything to add to that? Alan Shaw : Yes. They are distinct transactions and as we all know with real estate, the closing date can move forward or move back. So it's an initiative of ours. It's been an initiative for several years. It provided benefit in 2016 and we expect that it's going to do even more so in 2017. Brian Konigsberg : But it's not explicitly in the plan, is that right? Alan Shaw : We always do budget for a certain level of gain from sale of both operating and non-operating properties, so that's a standard item in our budgets. Brian Konigsberg : Okay. If I could just add one more quick one maybe for Mike. So you had a good - I guess you did very well on lengthening or expanding the train lengths and actually keeping up the velocity. Maybe just talk about what the opportunity is on lengthening more in '17 and how do you balance that with the velocity and the service metrics? Michael Wheeler : Yeah. Sure. It's something we focus on a lot. We feel like we've got -- not feel -- we know we've got capacity on our trains, particularly on the intermodal and merchandise networks, so we will continue to see it grow, a lot of work going on there to make that happen. But we are doing it very thoughtfully so that, one, we keep our terminals fluid and be able to keep the overall velocity of all the assets to the railroad flowing. And we also spend time with our customers on working with them on how we can increase train lengths as well and we both benefit. So a lot of initiative there and still opportunity going forward. Brian Konigsberg : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Squires for closing comments. James Squires : Thank you very much for your time this morning. We will continue to push hard to drive shareholder value through successful execution of our strategic plan. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

Now, it is my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's Chairman, President and CEO, Jim Squires. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Norfolk Southern's First Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. With me are Alan Shaw, Chief Marketing Officer; Mike Wheeler, Chief Operating Officer; and Marta Stewart, Chief Financial Officer. We are pleased to report another strong quarter of financial and operational results. Our first quarter record results reflect the successful execution of our strategy to drive both service and operational performance in a growth environment. As shown on slide 4, we achieved a record first quarter operating ratio of 70%, despite rising fuel prices, as well as record income from operations of $773 million, up 7% compared to the prior-year period. Earnings per share increased 15% to a record $1.48. Capitalizing on our 2016 success, we have stayed focused on our core mission of safety, service, productivity and growth, the cornerstones of our strategic plan. We have demonstrated our ability to adapt to a changing world. Last year, we excelled in a challenging economic environment, improved our service and significantly reduced costs. This year, we're off to a strong start. We are building on the momentum we've created and continue to focus on strengthening our company, positioning NS for growth and maintaining a disciplined cost structure. As evidenced by our recent results, Norfolk Southern is relentlessly focused on improving productivity and prudently investing to drive efficiency and growth. Slide 5 highlights some of the components of our continued operational success. Our measure of network performance, the Composite Service Metric, has remained steady even as units increased. We are driving continued improvements in customer service and efficiency through the solid execution of our operating plan. To ensure we are providing a service product that is tuned to our customers' needs and that drives return on assets, we have implemented strong analytical tools and multi-department insights. For example, our new crew planning model has enhanced our ability to manage employee resources effectively with demand, which supports our high service quality while also keeping costs in check. We are confident that service will increasingly be an important differentiator for our company. Improved resource utilization also remains a core focus, and Mike will detail our initiatives and progress in all the major areas including employee, locomotive and fuel efficiencies later on this call. We expect our initiatives to generate at least $100 million of productivity savings this year, building on the $250 million of productivity savings achieved last year. We continue to make strong progress on our productivity initiatives and remain on track to achieve our objective of $650 million in annual savings by 2020. We have a balanced strategy that leverages strong long-term partnerships with customers and dynamic internal processes that support effective asset management. Our planning and operating technology, informed by collaboration with our customers, is strengthening our position in the supply chain. For example, we are working together with our customers to further align our internal metrics with those that are most important to their unique operations. Additionally, through this holistic focus on the entire supply chain, we are proactively aligning resources with demand. We have initiatives for additional improvements ongoing as we develop new technology to optimize the distribution of empty equipment, and that improves load scheduling, visibility and flexibility. As reflected on the lower right of slide 5, the efficiencies we have already achieved have enabled us to effectively contain employee resources while delivering growth. We are confident that our strategic plan is sustainable and provides a strong foundation to attain growth at low incremental costs, and that's a powerful formula for enhanced shareholder value. In 2016, we returned $1.5 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and we're on track for similar amounts in 2017. I'll now turn the program over to Alan Shaw, Chief Marketing Officer. Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Norfolk Southern delivered first quarter revenue of $2.6 billion, a strong 6% year-over-year increase, which was driven by volume growth of 5% and a revenue per unit improvement of 1%. We attained volume and revenue gains in all three of our major market groups with a particularly robust performance in coal, intermodal and steel versus the first quarter of 2016. Additionally, fuel surcharge revenues increased due to higher on-highway diesel prices. We maintain our focus on pricing. Revenue per unit excluding fuel was flat as pricing gains were offset by negative mix associated with increased intermodal volume and short-haul utility coal. On slide 8, Merchandise revenue was up 2% for the quarter with a 1% increase in volume and overall revenue per unit growth of 2%. Volume gains were primarily driven by metals and construction strength due to improved steel production and increased construction and drilling activity. Other markets declined slightly in the first quarter due to reduced energy shipments, truck competition and, in automotive, decreased U.S. light vehicle production. Merchandise revenue per unit increased 1% excluding fuel surcharge as positive pricing gains were partially offset by negative mix related to increased aggregate and soybean volume. Turning to our Intermodal market on slide 9, revenue of $571 million represents a 9% increase over first quarter 2016 with a 4% gain in volume and a 5% improvement in RPU. Our improved service product helped drive a 5% volume increase within our domestic intermodal franchise despite weakness across the trucking industry. Continued strength in East Coast port activity supported international volume, which was up 3%. Excluding fuel, our intermodal revenue per unit improvement of 1% was driven by current pricing initiatives within the context of a soft trucking environment. Moving to slide 10, Coal revenue increased 20% to $420 million in the first quarter, driven by significant volume increases in the export and utility markets as well as pricing gains. Utility coal volume of 17.6 million tons in the first quarter benefited from our previously announced market share gain and higher natural gas prices, which offset the impact of mild winter weather. In our export market, we handled 6.3 million tons in the quarter through Lamberts Point in Baltimore due to improved demand and pricing for U.S. export coal. More than doubling its shipments, Baltimore is primarily lower RPU thermal coal and represents 38% of our total export volume, while Lamberts Point grew over 50% and is predominantly metallurgical coal. As we look ahead to slide 11, our focus is on continuing to execute our strategic vision for growth. We are forecasting generally improved economic conditions, particularly related to manufacturing and consumer spending, which we expect will positively impact our volume. Merchandise volume is expected to be relatively flat in 2017. Crude oil, which represented over 50,000 units last year, is predicted to decline close to 30% in 2017 as shipments are diverted to the Dakota Access Pipeline. The largest year-over-year decrease is projected in the second quarter. Additionally, a projected 3.5% decline in 2017 U.S. vehicle production will negatively impact our automotive volume. However, metals and construction, grain and plastics are expected to be up year-over-year. Within Intermodal, our strong service product has and will continue to enable success in converting service-sensitive volume from the highway. Looking ahead, we expect positive macroeconomic trends to drive organic growth. Expected increases in transportation demand and gradually tightening truck capacity in the latter part of the year will provide potential volume growth through the remaining quarters this year. We expect year-over-year growth within our coal markets with export gains driven by the continued tightening of international supply, most recently affected by Cyclone Debbie in Australia. Though seaborne prices fell from the highs in late 2016 and earlier this year, the after effects of the cyclone recently increased prices again. This should be a short-term benefit to U.S. coals in the global market. Due to this volatility, we expect to exceed our guidance in the second quarter and return to 3.5 million ton to 4.5 million ton rate in the third and fourth quarters. We expect utility coal volume to grow this year and remain confident in our quarterly guidance range of 17 million tons to 19 million tons. It is important to note we are in shoulder months when the utilities typically rebuild their inventories from winter; although this winter was relatively mild, particularly in the South and, as a result, stockpiles remain elevated. Consistent with our strategic plan, we are securing high-quality revenue growth that complements our existing network. We have developed a service product conducive to attracting new revenue and launch new customer focused initiatives designed to improve our customer experience and make it easier to do business with Norfolk Southern. At the same time, we have a keen understanding of the capacity of our existing network and we'll work to balance growth in targeted areas with the needs of our customers. While leveraging the value of our service product, we will continue our initiatives to attain pricing in excess of rail inflation. As we have previously stated, we take a long-term view of our markets and pricing to yield sustainable shareholder value. We will continue to work with our customers to understand their expectations and remain an integral part of their supply chain. I will now turn it over to Mike, who will discuss our operational performance. Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Thank you, Alan, and good morning. In the first quarter, we successfully executed on our strategic plan to provide a high-level service product and to pursue productivity initiatives while handling more volume. Starting with safety on slide 13, we are pleased to see a 13% improvement in our reportable injury ratio as well as a 26% improvement in our serious injury ratio. These reductions demonstrate our continued dedication to maintaining a safe working environment for our employees throughout operations and the communities we operate in. Working safely and efficiently is a key component of our efforts to drive sustainable value creation. Turning to slide 14, we continue to drive improvements in network performance and operate at high service levels. Our service composite remains strong, with dwell improving 4% and train speed decreasing 4%. Moving to some of our productivity initiatives starting on slide 15, 2016 was a record year for train length and we are on track to set a new record for the full year. This is one of the factors that has allowed us to handle increased volume without a commensurate increase in resources. Importantly, we are ensuring we keep our yards fluid and we are providing a good service product to our customers. As Jim mentioned, we achieved these results by optimizing our operating plan and aggressively accelerating the use of distributed power, which utilizes locomotives on the head and rear of longer trains to allow for better train handling. As shown on slide 16, train length, along with the continued rationalization of our yard and local fleets, has resulted in significant improvements in our locomotive productivity. We removed 150 locomotives from service in 2016 and we removed another 50 so far this year, with an additional 100 to be removed in the second quarter. We did this by, again, reviewing our local and yard service and by combining deliveries so that fewer locomotives are required without affecting customer service. In total, we will have removed 300 locomotives from service since the beginning of last year. Consequently, we are on pace to set a new record this year for our locomotive productivity. Not only do these improvements drive lower maintenance costs, they also enhance our fuel efficiency and help protect our business against adverse fluctuations in fuel pricing. Taking a closer look at our fuel efficiency on slide 17, we achieved a 6% improvement in the first quarter versus the same period last year and, as you recall, 2016 was a record year for this measure. We accomplished this by improving train lengths, locomotive rationalizations and our energy management initiatives. Together, these initiatives continue to drive improvement in fuel efficiency. Lastly, on slide 18, we improved our employee productivity in the first quarter. We are continually rightsizing our workforce by working closely with our marketing team to project where we see growth and where we see reductions in our volumes. Our strategy of implementing hiring floors at our core locations, particularly in some which have proven difficult to hire in the past, is a part of our process to maintain high customer service levels. Remaining properly staffed also aids our asset utilization through improved velocity. Our ability to achieve these improvements is driven by optimizing our operating plan and our increases in train length. In addition, we are realizing improvements from our strategy of terminal rationalizations, which we continue to review as markets shift. We expect our full year T&E head count to be up slightly to handle expected increased volumes. In closing, we are executing on our flexible and balanced strategic plan, driving long-term growth through excellent customer service coupled with aggressive productivity initiatives. I will now turn it over to Marta to discuss our financial results and achievements. Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter operating results are summarized on slide 20. As Jim mentioned, both income from operations and the railway operating ratio set first quarter records. We expect to see year-over-year improvement in our operating ratio in each of the remaining quarters of this year as compared to 2016. Before we take a look at expenses in detail, let's examine the effects of changing fuel prices on both our revenues and our expenses. As highlighted at the top of slide 21, the net impact from fuel on our operating ratio in the first quarter was 170 basis points. The table on the slide shows the year-over-year change by quarter for both fuel surcharge revenue and fuel expense. Throughout 2016, we had largely offsetting declines. In the first quarter of this year, while fuel surcharge revenue was higher compared to the prior year, the increase was not enough to offset the increase in diesel fuel expense, thereby negatively impacting operating income by $33 million. The graph below the table illustrates that this was largely due to the divergence you can see reflected in the first quarter of 2016. Since the difference in prices narrowed thereafter, we do not expect a significant net effect on operating income in the remaining quarters of this year. Turning now to the component changes in operating expenses on slide 22, in total, expenses rose by $105 million, with the majority of that increase relating to fuel as all other categories increased by less than inflation plus volume. Let's take a closer look at the components. Fuel expense, as shown on slide 23, rose by $64 million and the higher fuel price accounted for all of the increase. As Mike described, we had markedly better fuel efficiency with a 1% decline in consumption despite the 5% increase in traffic. Slide 24 highlights the major drivers of the variance in Compensation and Benefits, which rose by $20 million, or 3% year-over-year. Increases associated with wage inflation and higher health and welfare rates added $31 million to expenses and we expect these increases to continue at a similar run rate for the remainder of the year. Partially offsetting these inflationary items were reduced employee levels, which resulted in $12 million of lower expense. Headcount was about 600 employees lower than the first quarter of 2016. Going forward, we expect total employment levels to remain steady, dependent, of course, on volume. Slide 25 shows the $16 million or 8% increase in the Materials and Other category. Claims costs were higher due to a case-specific accrual for a third-party claim which totaled $9 million. Additionally, locomotive and engineering materials were up $7 million. Turning to Purchased Services and Rents on slide 26, this category was down $2 million or 1% year-over-year. Equipment rents decreased by $6 million due to the lower automotive traffic Alan mentioned as well as better system fluidity. Costs associated with increased intermodal traffic accounted for an $8 million increase in purchased services during the quarter. Moving on to Income Taxes on slide 27, the effective rate for the quarter was 33.9% versus 35.5% in the first quarter of 2016. The rate this year was lower largely due to the impact of tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation. Slide 28 shows our bottom line first quarter results. Net income was $433 million, up 12% compared with 2016, and diluted earnings per share was $1.48, a first quarter record. This performance demonstrates the effectiveness of our strategy, which continues to drive record results. I'll now turn the call back to Jim for closing remarks. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Thank you, Marta. Now, before I move to closing comments and we open the line for Q&A, I do want to acknowledge a press release we issued this morning in conjunction with our earnings press release. This morning, we announced that Marta Stewart, our Chief Financial Officer, will be retiring effective August 1. Marta will be with us through the second quarter and will be back in late July to present our second quarter earnings, but I cannot let the moment pass without acknowledging her decision to retire and thanking her for her many contributions to Norfolk Southern over the years. We continue to execute our strategic plan and remain well on our way to reaching our goal of achieving $650 million in productivity savings and an operating ratio below 65% by 2020, all while maintaining our superior service product. Our plan is dynamic and flexible, and as we identify additional opportunities whether to improve productivity or drive growth, we will aggressively pursue them. Our strategy has proven successful and we have a strong, engaged team to continue the momentum. And with that, we'll now open the line for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. Our first question today comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse : Thanks. Good morning. So, I guess I'll take the obvious one here since I have the first question, but you put up solid operating results if you adjust out some of the onetime-ish items from the prior year as well as the current quarter. But if we think about the numbers that CSX put up last week and an indication that the 2018 OR could be in the low 60%s, does this up the ante for your long-term targets? And is there anything that you've observed in terms of the operational changes at CSX so far, including yard rationalization, etcetera, that you think you could adopt for your own network to bring out additional costs? I guess, long story short, does better competition breed better competition? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Good morning, Allison, and thank you for your question. We are watching closely what's happening in the industry with our peer and we are doing many of the same things, albeit at a somewhat more measured pace, and we will continue to do so. But we will focus on our strategy, which revolves around safety, service, productivity and growth. Safety, because it's absolutely the most important thing we do. We never take a day off when it comes to safety. Service, because we are a service company. Service excellence defined by our customers, because we serve them not vice versa. Productivity, because we have a very large asset base and it's our responsibility to manage it every day. Cost consciousness is in our bones. And lastly, growth, our customers want to grow and we want to grow with them, provided we can do so profitably. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse : Okay, great. Thank you. And just as a follow-up, speaking about growing with your customers profitably, do you expect to take any share gains from CSX to the extent that there's any network disruptions? And if so, what commodities do you think you'd likely see the most benefit and if there's any way to size the potential of that? Thank you. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: We're always looking for good revenue growth opportunities. We have the capacity and we have the willingness to take on additional volumes and growth provided we can continue to maintain excellent service levels and that the growth we take on flows to the bottom line. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey, great. Thanks, and good morning. I wanted to pick up a little bit on that last sort of comment just thinking a bit about relative operating ratios between geographic competitors. We focused a lot on the OR, but I want to get a sense from management's perspective. Do you think that you're either at a \u2013 do you think that different ORs put you at material disadvantages in terms of servicing the customer and sort of market share opportunities? Just want to get a rough sense of maybe sort of management's thinking about where you might stack relative to other peers from a margin standpoint, if it's as important for the customer service side? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: You know, I guess what I would emphasize, Chris, is that ours is a balanced strategy. We are working to grow the bottom line through topline growth and through better operating margin, and we get there through excellent service to our customers; and that helps us grow the revenue. It also helps us to operate efficiently as well, as we've shown in the past. So, it's really all about balance. It's a combination of topline growth, margin improvement driven by productivity and incremental margin; and, all while keeping our eye on the service ball and making sure that what we do is sustainable for the long-term as well. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up, just thinking about the volume opportunity in 2017, so your comps get decently easier in the second quarter relative to the first quarter. When you think about sort of the business opportunities ahead of you both from a competitive standpoint, but also from an organic standpoint, how should we be thinking about sort of volume trends as we go forward through the rest of the year? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Well, I'll say this, and then I'll turn it over to Alan for a little bit of color. Certainly, in the second quarter to-date, the volume comparison to last year is looking very favorable. And volume conditions feel pretty stable right now. We're looking for a good year in terms of growth. Alan? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yes, Chris, as you noted, we do have relatively easy comps in the second quarter. We also had that in the first quarter and we delivered 5% growth. It starts to get a little bit more difficult in the third and fourth quarters, although that's the time period in which most analysts expect that trucking competition is going to tighten. And so, we're going to continue to leverage our very good customer-focused service product and try and take trucks off the highway. We did that in the fourth quarter of last year, and we did that in the first quarter of this year in pretty loose truck environment. So, we feel good about where we are with growth. We've given you some guidance on what we see in our coal and our merchandise markets, and in our intermodal markets. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Morning, everyone. Jim, Marta, I'm wondering if you can comment on pricing trends in the first quarter and how that compared year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter in terms of whether it accelerated or decelerated? And are you confident you can get pricing over inflation in 2017? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Alan, why don't you take that one? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yes, we saw consistent pricing in the first quarter with last year, and we're continuing to differentiate ourselves based on our service and ability to innovate as supply chains evolve. We're confident in our ability to continue to drive high-quality revenue that complements our network at low incremental costs, which will ultimately and continue to drive shareholder value. Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Can I just follow up on that? When you say consistent pricing, did you mean the same rate of price increases you were getting last year is what you're getting this year? And can you comment on the sequential trends as well, please? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Sequentially, it's \u2013 yeah, it's pretty much the same as where we were last year year-over-year and sequentially. We continue to see pressure in the trucking environment and we are getting some very significant and competitive rate increases at our export coal franchise. As truck markets tighten and economic conditions continue to improve, we fully expect additional opportunities for price later this year and into 2018. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes. Thank you. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to follow up on the margin trajectory versus CSX, the first question. Jim, I wanted to just get your thoughts on if there are any structural reasons why Norfolk Southern returns should be much different than CSX over time. And I'm not asking you to comment on what CSX is doing, obviously, but the company, as you said previously \u2013 I mean, it's not really operating in a vacuum. You're very well aware what your competitors are doing. So, if you can just help us understand why there could be or would be any structural reasons the returns in your business would be different than CSX's as volumes do come back. Thanks very much. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Sure. Thanks for the question. So, let me put it this way, we have outlined a plan to deliver consistent, reliable, sustainable improvements in operating margin and bottom-line growth, and that's what we're going to do. It's a combination of factors, as we've been through. It's a balanced plan. It relies on both growth and productivity. And that will deliver the goods for shareholders, we are quite confident. Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. I thought I'd try to ask that question, but I appreciate the answer. Let me ask you one specific one with respect to the numbers. You talked originally about growing revenues at lower incremental costs, and that's kind of obvious, right, in a capital-intensive business. And it seems like if you adjust the net fuel expense, it looks like incremental margins did come in just above 50% in the quarter; and it seems like it would've actually been quite a bit more than that if the materials and claim expense were not as high as they were in the quarter. So just in that context related to your comment about year-on-year margin expansion in the remaining quarters, is kind of 50% to 60% normalized the right bogey in terms of incremental margins to drive that margin expansion, or are there any specific items in the cost structure that may make that number \u2013 that incremental margin number higher or lower as we look out into 2Q, 3Q and 4Q? Thank you. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: You know, we talked in the past about the composition of volume growth and its effect on incrementals, so that's certainly a factor to keep an eye on; but, you're absolutely right. Volume growth through a relatively fixed cost base is the key to high incremental margin and corresponding earnings growth, and that's really what we're focused on here. We're focused on disciplined cost structure that keeps costs in check while volumes are growing, as they are in this environment. Now, with that, let me turn it over to Marta to talk about the incremental margin in the quarter, excluding some of the items that you mentioned. Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yes, well, you're absolutely right that the fuel had a dampening effect in the first quarter. We don't think that's going to continue, as I described, in the second \u2013 at least not to that extent in the second, third and fourth quarters. So, our incremental margin excluding the fuel effect was closer to about 67% in the first quarter. In my remarks, I mentioned that we expect to have continued improvement in the OR. So, year-over-year, in the second, third and fourth quarters, we expect to improve the operating ratio. As you know, since we embarked on this strategic plan, for the past 5 quarters we have shown year-over-year operating ratio improvement, and we continue to expect that. So, based on that, you should expect that we'll have similar incremental margins going forward. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Good morning. And Marta, good luck in the next phase of your career as you move forward. But, Jim, you suggested doing things at a measured pace. I just want to understand that comment a little bit. The board \u2013 what does the board suggest that management start looking at? There was a recent 8-K, I think, talking about pay levels can accelerate significantly if you accelerate the plan. Can you talk about what was behind that? Is that maybe the board suggesting a faster pace or a larger scale in terms of your operating plan? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Sure, sure. So, when I say measured, I want to be clear. What I'm talking about is a pace of change and improvement that is sustainable for the long run. We are trying to produce sustainable financial improvements for the long run. With that said, we are looking at everything out there to drive acceleration of our financial results, and we won't stop with the plan that we have outlined. It's a flexible plan and when we see opportunities to improve upon it, we will jump on them. As you mentioned, Ken, the board did put in place an accelerated turnaround incentive and that's there to incentivize management to find those opportunities to drive improvement and acceleration. It's meant to be a stretch plan and that's what it's for, but we're going to work as hard as we can to achieve it. Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. And then a follow-up, Mike, you noted the composite service at 79%. I just want to maybe dig into that a little bit. Is that a grade? I just want to understand, are you giving yourself a C rating on the service? Is that on on-time performance? It just doesn't sound that efficient if something's operating at 79% of capability. Maybe you can talk a little bit about the input and outputs there. Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Sure; and the composite service is made up of several components. It's made up of train performance. It's made up of connections, and it's made up of planned adherence. So, it takes into account all of those in different measures to make sure that we are taking care of the customers' needs, and I would just relate that to the fact that our network velocity is still at all-time high records. So, we feel very comfortable with that. It's providing a good service product and our customers like what we're providing. Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Ken, this is Alan. Network performance is one way to look at it. Jim's been very clear that we're driving customer-specific service metrics that are unique to the markets that we serve and, in many cases, unique to the demands of individual customers as their transportation needs evolve. This allows us to improve the value that we provide to our customers. It provides for more rich conversation with our customers as we're renegotiating contracts and looking for additional business, about the benefits of the Norfolk Southern product. And, they can become defined as for individual customers or broadly by markets. And if you look at, say, intermodal, it could be availability of a box on a chassis at a terminal; within the merchandise network, it could be consistency of delivery to a customer location to the original ETA. Those are all important things to the customer. And I can tell you, categorically, that for each of those individual customer metrics, we are in much better shape than we were last year and have improved year-over-year. And that's what we're doing is we are collaborating with our customer to find out what they want and becoming a much more integral part of their supply chain. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your questions. Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Yeah. Thanks for taking my question this morning. So, Jim, what are you and the rest of the board's priorities, both for experience and skill set, as you search for Norfolk's next CFO? And can you just give us a little signal on where your head is \u2013 the odds of an external versus an internal hire at this point from where you sit? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Well, granted, we have big shoes to fill here, that's for sure, with Marta's departure. But look, we're looking for someone who is going to focus single-mindedly on shareholder value. That's the type of person we want in the CFO seat and throughout the C suite. Our focus is driving shareholder value through successful execution of our strategic plan. That's the number one criterion for the next CFO. Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : And the internal versus external, is there any color you can give us on how you guys are thinking about that? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: We have some excellent internal candidates and we're going to look at external candidates as well, and we'll see what falls out of that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC. Please proceed with your questions. Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: Yeah, thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. So, I guess my question is on the efficiency trends that you did reaffirm here, both for the full year and longer term, but I don't think I heard an update as to what the run rate is for the first quarter and whether there's been a change to the cadence of that, particularly on the employee side. I think I heard that you're guiding for up slightly, now, from flat and still at 5% inflation, all-in inflation. Is that correct? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: So, we don't guide on quarterly productivity. Let me just say that at the outset. We did see some improvements in the first quarter. Marta, let me turn it over to you to address the employment question, specifically. Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Okay. So, on the employment question, and I'm glad you asked that because we have a couple of pieces there. So, as Mike described, we do expect, with the volume increase that Alan talked about, we do expect that we will need to add some train and engine employees, those employees that directly face the customer, directly affect our service. However, overall, for our total employment, we expect to keep that about even for the remainder of the year, sequentially with the first quarter. As you noted, that is a reduction from last year. So previously, we had guided to staying even with last year's average, which was about 27,900. We now think that our employment level will be about 400 less; 27,500 for the full year. Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: Okay. Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: And we plan to use attrition across the other areas. So, in other words, the customer-facing folks, the train and engine folks will go up, but all of the other areas, we will handle attrition to offset that. Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: Great. Okay, and then my follow-up is on tax. You were about 300 basis points below, I think, the 37% you'd been guiding to, Marta, before? Can you reconfirm? Is it 37% we should be using? And I think you mentioned it was on stock-based comp. Can you quantify that? Was that the full 300 basis points relative to what you had been guiding us for the 37% on a run-rate basis? Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yes, just about. It was substantially all of that difference. And so, the normalized rate, if you will, you're correct, that we guided to was 37%. In the first quarter, PSUs and RSUs were issued because they're earned out in the first quarter. In addition, as the stock hit all-time highs in the first quarter, options were exercised. So, going forward, depending on what happens with option exercise in the remainder of the year, we may see the normalized 37% a little bit lower. However, it probably won't be as much as the first quarter, 3%, because we don't have the PSU / RSU earn-out other than in the first quarter of the year. Does that make sense? Operator : Yes. Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your questions Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : Yes. Good morning, and congratulations on the strong results. Those look like you showed very good improvement on a number of different metrics, and it's strong results. I wanted to ask a bit on the operating side; and you gave some very useful metrics to look at for productivity, locomotive productivity, train length. What do you think the opportunity is as you look the next several quarters and even into next year? Are there \u2013 you talked about using distributed power. You talked about significant locomotive productivity gains and train length expansion. Does that opportunity continue? Is that going to linger the next couple of quarters or have you realized a lot and you need to pause? So, just wonder if you could offer some more on broader productivity on a couple of metrics. Thank you. Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yes, well, we're not pausing at all on any of those. We talked about 50 locomotives already out this year, and another 100 we're going to have out here in the next month or so. That'll help. And then, going forward, we continue to look at what opportunities there are further in reducing locomotives from the fleet, still keeping our service product the way it needs to be. We're continuing to work on rationalizing our freight car fleet as well, taking freight cars out of the fleet, but still providing good customer service, particularly by going to a more homogenous fleet and flexible fleet. So, those are big initiatives. We continue to aggressively implement distributed power; still a lot of opportunities there. Fuel efficiency, a lot of initiatives still going on there. So, I don't think that we're pausing at all. In fact, I think we continue to ramp-up aggressively all these things. We just have a lot of productivity initiatives in the hopper that we're working on. Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yes, Mike, you talked about our equipment strategy, and I think it's notable that our efforts to go to a more homogenized fleet don't just benefit operations. It also improves our ability to compete with truck and provide a better service product to our customer. It's more flexible by definition. It lowers investment risk. It lowers operating costs, and it improves our ability to provide a serviceable piece of equipment to our customer in good working order on time. Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yes. Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: So, there's great collaboration between marketing and operations on a lot of these initiatives to make sure that we're taking a sustainable approach and a balanced approach to take costs out while improving our service \u2013 individual service to our customers. Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : Can you \u2013 that's helpful. I appreciate that. Can you give \u2013 are there any numbers you can say, well, like distributed power, we've got X percent of trains on distributed power and we think we can get to Y? Can you give any kind of framework for that and \u2013 not second quarter, but just the next couple of years what you could get to, or even on kind of maybe locomotives or cars that you might be able to put in storage, things like that? Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.: No, not really. All I can say is it's all going to be more. We're going to have more distributed power. We've got a plan to have more cars out of the network, like Alan talked about, but still providing the good service. So, all these things that we've got in place are going to be more and better, but we don't have a quantity to put out there right now; but, you will continue to see improvement. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your questions. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Good morning. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Marta, I wanted to ask a different one on the operating ratio. So, if I look historically, first quarter and then the full year, the full year is typically, I don't know, 300 basis points or 400 basis points better than the first quarter, so kind of implying a 66% or 67% operating ratio for the year. Is there anything wrong with that math, or anything you want us to think about, good or bad, relative to kind of what we've seen historically from the model? And then, just maybe along those lines, can you just remind us how much more head count you have to go relative to the initial plan as part of the $650 million of productivity? Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Okay. Well, as I mentioned in my remarks, we expect the OR in the second, third and fourth quarters of this year to be lower than the OR of last year; and, I think we'll leave it at that in terms of detail. As you know, all of those quarters last year were well below 70%. So, we continue to expect improvement in the operating ratio. Now, with regard to the employee head count levels, we're currently down 2,600, approximately, employees in total from the end of 2015 \u2013 or the average for 2015. And so, the \u2013 going forward, the savings will be in maintaining that lower level of head count as well as the other things within compensation that are not head count-related: the overtime, which Mike and his folks are really working on, keeping the overtime down in all of our categories; the extra boards; the re-crews. And so, it's a combination to get to our total goal of about $400 million over the five-year reduction in compensation and benefits through that head count and a managing the average cost per employee number as well. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : And just to follow up, do you think is there \u2013 if volumes continue to improve and you need to add more T&E, is there enough other non-T&E to potentially remove to keep head count flat next year as well in a flat \u2013 in a growing volume environment? Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: That is our goal. What we are looking \u2013 that's our plan for this year, as Mike and I both described, was T&E is going up, the others are going down slightly in order to stay level with the first quarter. Going into 2017 \u2013 I mean 2018, to get out to the next year, we will always attempt to try to keep the appropriate resources to have the right amount of good customer service, and then take it in elsewhere in the company, if we can. But that will depend on the level of growth of volume that we have in 2018, if we're able to offset it completely. Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yes, and we're really not growing the overall T&E count. We're hiring to handle attrition and volume growth, right? So, it's not a long-term growth of our T&E population. Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: You mean in 2018. Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Correct. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions. Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Good morning. Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : So, Alan, just had a follow-up on kind of the realized rates ex-fuel, and especially on coal. Revenue per unit there ex-fuel was down 1%; exposures you highlight, the rate mix. Other were basically down 2%. You mentioned the short-haul utility coal, but just wanted to circle back to the export coal market pricing that we've all seen get pretty strong here, recently. And also, the volumes you mention were actually up quite a bit in Lamberts Point. I think it was over 50%. So just wondering if you can help us figure out if that's going to come through on a lag, or it's really a big mix headwind from the shorter haul utility coal that's keeping some of those numbers down? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Hey, Brian, I'm glad you brought that up. It's \u2013 it is an issue with the mix headwind, as you reference. However, we did get very competitive rate increases, and very significant rate increases, at Lamberts Point; although, you should note that Lamberts Point is still only 14% of our overall coal volume. So, it's a relatively minor component, because we have a pretty diverse coal franchise. And so, while Lamberts Point grew over 50%, Baltimore, which is more of a thermal market and has a lower RPU, grew over 100%. And so, you can see some mix issues within that within export. And then, we were supported by a market share gain in the North, and the very mild weather in the South limited our growth in Utility South. So, last year, we had talked at this time, Brian, our Utility South volume was about 54%, 55% of our utility volume. That's flipped a little bit. And now, Utility North is more than 50% of our utility volume. That also has a \u2013 tends to have a lower length of haul than Utility South, and so that creates some pressure on our RPU. But I'll note, we are really focused on adding high-quality revenue that fits our network, complements our product and drives long-term shareholder value. And that's \u2013 and our first quarter results reflect a successful execution of that strategy. Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, thanks. I appreciate the detail on that. And just as a follow-up is \u2013 we've seen the export met coal price continue to move up and volume's trending pretty (53:58) strong there as well, would you expect mix headwinds to at least get a little bit better, maybe not as bad, as we haven't seen the same strength on the thermal export market? Thank you. Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yeah. You noted that with Cyclone Debbie that prices have gone up. That's a near-term phenomenon and we're already starting to see a correction there; although, that will benefit, clearly, our second quarter export volumes. And so, in my remarks, I guided to the fact that we would probably exceed our previous guidance of 3.5 million tons to 4.5 million tons in the second quarter, and then third and fourth quarters would be back within that range. There's a lot of volatility, as you could expect, within our coal network; not only because of seaborne prices, but also because utility coal is now a load follower and stockpiles, while significantly down from last year, are still elevated. And so, we're going to be watching the same things that you watch. We're going to be watching natural gas prices, weather, electricity demand, cooking coal prices and API, too. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please state your questions. Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.: Thanks, and good morning. So, maybe to follow up, first, on some of that coal commentary, when you combine all of the puts and takes that you just walked through, do you think consolidated coal RPU can move higher sequentially over the remainder of the year? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: It's going to be highly dependent upon market conditions and those four or five factors that I just referenced, Justin. We're getting price. We're particularly getting price in the export met market. The sustainability of that's going to be dependent upon the \u2013 some of the factors, such as coke and coal price. Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.: Okay, and then maybe shifting gears to intermodal, your two major IMC (56:14) partners have both indicated the intermodal pricing environment has been highly competitive at the start of the year. And I was curious if your approach to that market has changed at all, and would you be willing to provide any additional rate relief to your intermodal partners this year or are those rate increases at this point unlikely to change? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yeah, we \u2013 Justin, we take a long-term sustainable view of our pricing, the value of our service product, the markets and the customers we serve, which ultimately is going to promote shareholder value in the near-term and long-term. We are fully confident that trucking capacity is going to tighten in the second half of this year, which will lift truck prices maybe \u2013 late this year and early next year, and we're taking a long-term approach to this. We grew our volume in the fourth quarter of last year in a difficult truck environment. We grew our volume in the first quarter of this year in a difficult truck environment as we leveraged the value of our service product. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please state your question. Eric Morgan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, good morning. This is Eric Morgan on for Brandon. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to follow up on some of your more structural costs. It sounds like you're making progress with terminal rationalization, but, Mike, I think you mentioned you're actively reviewing some of those initiatives as markets shift. I guess, can you elaborate on some of the things you're looking at there and if that's where some of the opportunity is for acceleration in the plan? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: I'll let Mike address the specifics of your question, but I want to emphasize just how focused we are on structural costs reductions. That is essential to successful execution of our long-range plan, so whether it's fixed assets in the network or it's mobile assets like locomotives, we are very focused on improving productivity in those areas. Mike? Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yeah. So, there's a couple pieces to it. Obviously, we want to make our operating plan as optimized as we can, and we spend every day doing that working through the plan. The other piece is the terminals. Where can you take cost out of the terminals, whether it's idling a terminal and taking it out of your network, we look at that all the time? There are things we're working on \u2013 or just taking costs out by having less resources at those terminals, whether they go from three shifts to two; we're finding ways to do more in those terminals with less resources. So, it's a combination of optimizing the operating plan to reduce costs, finding ways to take out costs in the terminals, whether it's taking them out of the network or just driving costs out of those terminals. And we're working on all three of those, and you'll see all of those incrementally improve. Eric Morgan - Barclays Capital, Inc.: All right. I appreciate that and maybe just a quick follow-up on yard productivity. Can you just update us on the number of hump yards you're operating and maybe your views on converting to flat switching and how that might impact both the cost structure and the ability to service the customer? Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yes, so we have 10 hump yards. And as we've noted on here, we've idled three of those over the last couple of years, the last being last year in Knoxville, Tennessee. So, we continue to look at it. But those yards, they're part of our network. They're part of processing the volume of cars through the railroad and they're part of what we have to make sure we provide a good service product. So, we're balanced and making sure we've got a good service product, but finding ways to take costs out; and, if we can take terminals out and still provide a good service product and the velocity being there, we're going to do that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question. Matt Elkott - Cowen & Co. LLC: Good morning. This is actually Matt Elkott for Jason. Thank you for taking our question. Staying on this topic here, I was wondering if you guys can talk a little bit about the potential track reduction opportunities. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Mike? Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yes, we don't see large pieces of the network coming out. As Alan has noted before, we've got a network reach that's very good for our customers, and that's an asset and a competitive advantage. But we do look at ways to take costs off the lines and still provide the service product that we need. So, if it's a lower density branch line, we're able to continue to reduce the speeds, continue to take costs out, but still safely service the customer commitments that we have on there. So, we don't see large pieces of the network necessarily coming out from a line standpoint, but the costs will come out as we continue to find ways to service those pieces of railroad at a lower cost. And we're doing it; a lot of initiatives we have in place to do that. So, you won't see big chunks of the railroad coming out, but you'll see costs come out. Matt Elkott - Cowen & Co. LLC: Got it. That's very helpful. And just one quick follow-up on the locomotive front, I know you have plans to remove from service some additional locomotives. What does volume have to do from your current internal expectations for the year, whether accelerate or decelerate, for you to reconsider the number of locomotives that you're taking out? Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yes, so what we've already committed to, the 50 that we've done and the 100 that we're going to take out, is really not volume dependent at all. Going forward, as volume comes back \u2013 comes to the railroad, we've got the ability to add that volume to our trains without having to add commensurate locomotives. So, we don't see having to add a bunch of locomotives to the fleet going forward to handle volume, with all the initiatives we have going on. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. Alan, I wanted to see if you could comment a little bit about what you think the Norfolk strategy will be if the truck market does start to tighten. It seems historically you guys have been more pushing volume into a less mature intermodal network and keeping rates low in order to do that. Do you think that if the truck market tightens, you'll be able to kind of push both the price and volume levers, or do you think it'll still be more of a volume story? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Dave, we're achieving price. We have achieved price, and we're going to continue to do it. For us, truck is pricing opportunity. Conversions from truck create an opportunity not just in intermodal, but in our merchandise network. And Mike and I talked about collaborating with customers on an equipment strategy that allows us to convert truck to rail in the merchandise network. So, we're going to continue to push on price. We've achieved price and volume in very difficult truck environment last year and in the first quarter of this year. It's potentially starting to tighten a little bit, and the analysts believe that it's going to tighten a lot more as the year progresses. So, that's our focus is taking a long-term view of our pricing and the value of our service. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: How do I square that with the 1% gain in the intermodal RPU ex-fuel? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: We had some shifts within our intermodal network, but we achieved our price. And, clearly, truck is limiting the upside to our price, so we've talked about that in the past, too. We're confident in our ability as we move forward and our results reflect it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Aegis Capital. Please proceed with your question. Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Aegis Capital Corp.: Thank you very much, and congratulations on the quarter. A lot of my questions have been asked at this point, so let me turn to a longer-term one in terms of your capital plan. We've had a lot of rationalization. You talked about putting more locomotives and cars into storage, yet the free cash flow is growing. What are your thoughts in terms of capital reinvestment in the business and kind of where are the more attractive opportunities near-term for capital dollars that, say, may drive more productivity or may enhance operations? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: So, we've outlined, in conjunction with our long-range plan, our intent with respect to capital allocation. First call on capital is always reinvestment in the business. We see great investment opportunities there, and we intend to continue to maintain our franchise through judicious capital investment and we'll fund growth opportunities as well, as appropriate. With the excess capital, with free cash flow, we'll buy back shares and we will pay a dividend, as we have always done. So, at a high level, that's our capital allocation strategy. Marta, you want to fill in some of the blanks in terms of what we've outlined for 2017? Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: So, with regard to the capital budget for this year, we have planned on $1.9 billion. You are correct to note that, going forward, we think that's going to go down because that includes $240 million for PTC. As we complete that, we are looking to holding capital spending, but still provide for growth capital. We analyze our growth capital very strenuously. Mike and his folks, too \u2013 one big component of that, as you noted, too, is locomotives. We have a robust locomotive rebuild program that we started working on several years ago; have really accelerated last year and this year, and we expect that to continue into the future. We have a good base of \u2013 fleet of locomotives that we can upgrade that well, and that's going to be a key component in the future in being able to control our total capital spend. Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Upgrading the locomotives at a lower capital cost, it's a win-win. Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Aegis Capital Corp.: Okay. Thank you and best of luck, Marta. Thank you. Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. Zachary N. Rosenberg - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hi. Thanks. Actually, Zach Rosenberg on for Ben here. Thanks for squeezing us in. I want to shift the questions here a little bit. I saw that there was a comment from President Trump out expecting a tariff on softwood lumber going into the U.S. from Canada. Just wondering, specifically, if that has any impact to your guys business and network? But more broadly, just if you have any kind of updated thoughts on the potential impact to the business just from increasingly protectionist policy and any updates on thoughts around regulation? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: I'll take the question about regulation, generally. We are certainly in favor of a lighter touch with respect to regulation in some parts of our business. In fact, across the board, any time we see an opportunity to achieve further productivity and otherwise advance our financial objectives, we're going to be in support of it. And that certainly includes lightening the regulatory burden. Why don't you comment specifically on the announcement recently? Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yeah, Zach, as we look at it, that may result in additional volume coming from the Pacific Northwest into our markets or it may result in additional volume that originates on our network. So, all in all, we don't think it's going to have a material impact on our volumes. Zachary N. Rosenberg - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you. That's it for me. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please proceed with your question. Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities, Inc.: Thanks very much and good morning. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Good morning. Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities, Inc.: Just wanted to ask one, because the call is running long, and that was with respect to your plan to move to a more homogenous equipment fleet, which has obvious benefits. Can you just comment on how quickly that happens through natural attrition of the fleet, if you will, and whether at some point you would consider stepping up your CapEx to accelerate that process? Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yeah, this is Mike. No, we don't expect to accelerate our CapEx at all for that. And we've got a couple thousand that are going to come out of the fleet this year because we are more homogenous going to a car that can be used in many different areas, and it's already progressing. It's been part of what we've been doing for the last several years. We've taken several thousand, almost 17,000, cars out of our fleet over the last several years and we're continuing that, but still being able to have a car when the customer needs it. Alan, anything you want to add to that? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: It's a process. As cars fall out, we can scrap them. It's a homogenous fleet and it has quicker cycle times. You have to buy \u2013 purchase less cars, invest in less equipment to replace that carrying capacity. Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.: It's more flexible. Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: And, Cherilyn, the expectation of this gradual conversion to a more homogenous fleet is anticipated in our five-year capital plan, already. Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities, Inc.: Okay. Can you just elaborate on how many car types you would have today and where that might go directionally? Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.: We've got a lot of car types out there, but we're probably 50 different car types out there. We're trying to take probably 10% of that out this year and probably took 10 of them out last year. So, we've gone down from 60 types of cars to 50 with being in the 40s this year. Operator : Thank you. At this time, there are no additional questions. I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Squires for closing comments. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Well, thank you very much, everyone, for your time, attention and questions this morning. We will talk to you next quarter. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

Bernstein & Co. LLC Operator : Greetings, and welcome to Norfolk Southern Second Quarter 2017 Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Katie Cook, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Ms. Cook. You may now begin. Katie U. Cook - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Thank you, Rob, and good morning. Before we begin, please note that during today's call, we may make certain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and may differ materially from actual results. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. The slides of the presenters are available on our website at norfolksouthern.com in the Investors' section, along with our non-GAAP reconciliation. Additionally, a transcript and downloads will be posted after the call. Now, it is my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's Chairman, President, and CEO, Jim Squires. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Norfolk Southern's second quarter 2017 earnings call. With me today are Alan Shaw, Chief Marketing Officer; Mike Wheeler, Chief Operating Officer; and Marta Stewart, Chief Financial Officer. Turning now to slide 4, we're pleased to report another quarter of strong financial results, as we've continued to drive both resource utilization and growth. Marking our sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating ratio improvements and an all-time record, we decreased our second quarter operating ratio by 230 basis points to 66.3%. Income from operations of $888 million was up 15% compared to the prior-year period. Earnings per share increased 26% to $1.71. We continue to successfully, execute our multidimensional strategy and achieved another record operating ratio of $68.1 million for the first half of the year, a 130 basis point improvement from last year's record. Income from operations was up 11% to $1.7 billion. And earnings per share increased 20% to $3.18, also a first half record. These results demonstrate that our strategic plan built upon our core pillars of safety, service, stewardship, and growth is working as intended, providing a reliable framework that our team has successfully executed upon to propel improved operational efficiencies, which will deliver over $100 million productivity savings this year. The determination and perseverance of our employees to affect sustainable change has been instrumental in our achievements. Importantly, their work has also established a strong foundation for ongoing growth and success. As reflected on slide 5, since the inception of our strategic plan, we have commenced a broad set of initiatives including, reducing G&A and consolidating headquarters; restructuring Triple Crown and Pocahontas Land subsidiaries; rationalizing over 1,000 miles of track, including the short lining of our West Virginia Secondary and Delmarva south lines; idling our Ashtabula Docks coal terminal and restructuring yards, including the idling of Knoxville, Sevier Yard, and Chattanooga hump operations; and consolidating operating regions and divisions, including the recently announced consolidation of our Central Division. In addition to these initiatives, we have rationalized and revitalized our locomotive fleet, achieving our highest quarterly locomotive productivity and fuel efficiency on record. Productivity initiatives targeting freight car utilization are ongoing as well. Through our dynamic plan, we are continuing to aggressively pursue additional opportunities for improvement. Mike will provide you with an update on our ongoing initiatives and metrics later on the call. Moving to slide 6. With respect to our market approach, we remain steadfast in our commitment to deliver quality service that our customers value and growth that complements our network. Alan will provide additional details on some of our ongoing initiatives, which include : partnering with customers to develop unique key performance indicators; implementing projects that enhance both the customers experience and improve our efficiencies; and leveraging the strength of our industrial development team to feed our pipeline for future growth. As a result of our initiatives, and as you can see on the right of this slide, we've increased volumes by 6%, while reducing average head count 3% versus last year's levels and 10% compared to 2015. Our strategy has supported the return of capital to shareholders, through increase in dividend payments and share buybacks. As reflected on slide 7, cumulative distributions have totaled $17.1 billion since the inception of our share repurchase program in 2006. Dividends per share have increased by 12% compound annual growth rate over that period. In addition, we've repurchased nearly 164 million shares at an average cost of about $65 a share. As we look forward, given the strong financial results we've achieved to-date and the confidence we have in outlook, we're increasing this year's share repurchase guidance by 25% to $1 billion. Turning now to our longer-term guidance on slide 8, we continue to make solid progress toward achieving a sub-65% operating ratio, which I'm confident we'll accomplish by 2020 or sooner. I have consistently said that our plan is dynamic and flexible. And as we reach these targets, we're committed to driving performance improvement, whether through improved productivity, or growth, or both. I have every confidence in our ability to achieve and surpass our objectives and create sustainable value in both the short and long term. And I'll now turn the program over to Alan Shaw, Chief Marketing Officer. Alan? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter was marked by strong year-over-year volume improvement in intermodal and coal, generating total revenue of $2.6 billion, up 7% versus 2016. Intermodal reached a record quarterly volume with a year-over-year increase of 57,000 units, benefiting from continued highway conversions and new service offerings. Utility coal increased 27,000 shipments in the second quarter as a result of a previously reported market share gain and higher year-over-year natural gas prices. Export coal grew 25,000 units due to improved seaborne pricing, which made U.S. coals more competitive in the international market. Positive pricing was partially offset by mix, improving our revenue per unit in all seven groups, and 1% in total. Overall, our merchandise volume was flat in the second quarter as gains in frac sand and steel were offset by declines in crude oil. Growth in the metals and construction segment was driven by increases in shipments of frac sand due to increased drilling activity in the Marcellus and Utica Shale regions. Additionally, improvements in steel pricing, change in supply chains, and inventory replenishment led to higher volumes in our steel franchise. These gains were partially offset by the clients in our crude oil volume, which has been negatively impacted by pipeline activity. Automotive volume declined due to decreases in U.S. vehicle production. While paper was impacted by strong truck competition. Merchandized revenue increased 1% versus second quarter 2016 to $1.6 billion, with a corresponding 2% increase in revenue per unit. Positive pricing was impacted by mix shifts, as well as excess truck capacity. On slide 12, intermodal revenue increased 10% to $593 million, as volume increased 6% to over 1 million units. Domestic volume grew in the second quarter due to continued highway conversions and collaboration with our channel partners to develop new markets. These gains were partially offset by headwinds due to elevated truck capacity. Our alignment with shipping partners growing at East Coast ports led to 5% growth in our international volume. Revenue per unit was up 4%. Intermodal pricing continues to be impacted by excess truck capacity, a condition we expect to improve as the year progresses. Tightening capacity is expected to drive stronger pricing growth in 2018. Moving to slide 13, our coal revenue grew an impressive 32% versus the same period last year to $447 million. Volume increased 27% and revenue per unit improved 4% compared to second quarter 2016. Increased utility coal volume resulted from the previously discussed market share gain coupled with favorable natural gas prices compared to prior-year levels. Growth in this segment was also driven by increased export volume as tightening international supply improved seaborne pricing. Year-over-year, revenue per unit increased 4%. Positive pricing, particularly in our export market, was partially offset by increased short-haul Utility North volume and mix shifts within the export market, similar to what we saw on the first quarter. Moving to slide 14, we expect year-over-year growth in the third quarter, led by intermodal and coal, with low to mid-single-digit decline in our merchandise volume. Comparisons to last year become more difficult, as overall volumes began to accelerate sequentially in the third quarter of 2016. Merchandise volume is expected to be negatively impacted by continued diversions of crude oil and natural gas liquids to pipelines. Steel shipments are expected to decline sequentially as customer inventories were replenished in the first half of this year. Moreover, a projected annual 6% decrease in U.S. vehicle production will negatively impact automotive volume in the second half, with the largest year-over-year decrease in the third quarter. Partially offsetting these declines, we project continued growth in frac sand due to increased natural gas production, although the year-over-year growth will be less than what we experienced in the second quarter. We are generating opportunities, as our customer supply chains adapt to the rapidly evolving e-commerce and consumer markets. Our marketing and operations teams are collaborating together with our customers to align their growth with ours through new strategic services that capitalize on these quickly-changing market trends. Our intermodal franchise benefited from these new services in the second quarter, which will provide ongoing growth for years to come. We are also prepared for growth as the truck market continues to tighten, driving highway to rail conversions, strong service products that focus on the needs of our customers, as well as efficient operations provide confidence that our growing intermodal franchise will continue to enhance shareholder value. While we project the year-over-year improvement in the coal market in the second half, the pace of this growth will lessen due to a sequential decline in export coal and higher utility volume in the second half of last year. Export tonnage will likely moderate from first half levels to the 4 million to 5 million ton per quarter range, with volume contingent on sustained seaborne price levels. In line with our projections last quarter, we anticipate third quarter utility tonnage between 17 million and 19 million tons, with the fourth quarter tonnage contingent on some of our stockpile levels and natural gas prices. Our best-in-class industrial development team consistently works with potential new customers, strengthening our position in the supply chain. Our list of active projects remains robust and will provide continued growth opportunities that will benefit future-year volumes, further underscoring the sustainability of our plan. Our strategic plan maintains a focus on the customer experience. Part of this focus includes working with our customers to align our service metrics with our customers' view of our performance, as well as partnering to ensure we provide effective tools to schedule and manage their business with Norfolk Southern. Our aim is to continually evolve the elements of our operations that drive quality growth and efficiency. This approach increases our value to customers and strengthens our position in the marketplace for the near and long term. As our customers are innovating to serve a dynamic changing world, we are doing the same, working together to design efficient supply chain solutions for their emerging needs. For example, we recently repurposed a Triple Crown yard to provide innovative solutions for the gas market. We further enhanced this service by combining aspects of unit train operations with the demand for single-car shipments. Customers value these types of innovative solutions, driven by the continuity and our longstanding customer relationships, market knowledge, and seamless marketing and operating philosophy. With our strong partnerships throughout the supply chain, we'll continue to enhance our ability to serve our customers, while generating strong returns for our shareholders. I will now turn it over to Mike, who will discuss our operational performance. Michael J. Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Thank you, Alan, and good morning. In the second quarter, we continued to grow our business and provide a good service product to our customers. We also achieved our strong results, while streamlining our operations and idling our largest hump yard to-date in Chattanooga. Our all-time record operating ratio for a quarter as well as for the first half of the year is a testament to our strategic plan and the hard work of our employees. As shown on slide 16, there were significant milestones achieved in the quarter as well as the first half of the year that were key drivers of our success. The efforts towards driving locomotive productivity, fuel efficiency, and train length, which we will discuss in more detail later in the presentation, all helped to drive our record operating ratio. As noted on slide 17, we are continuing to take steps to improve service and reduce cost. We idled our largest hump yard yet in Chattanooga in the second quarter, and this is the fourth major hump yard idled. We have also announced the consolidation of our Central Division, which will further reduce the number of operating divisions from 10 to 9. This is a continuation of the steps we took in 2016, wherein we consolidated from 11 to 10 divisions and reduced the number of operating regions by a third. In addition, as we discussed on our last call, we removed another 100 locomotives from service in the second quarter, and we did so while handling more volume. All of these actions drive the pillars of our strategic plan : safety; service; productivity; and growth, and puts us on-track to exceed $100 million of annual productivity savings this year. Moving to safety on slide 18, we are pleased to see a 12% improvement in our reportable injury ratio, as well as a 23% improvement in our serious injury ratio. These reductions demonstrate our continued dedication to maintaining a safe and productive working environment for our employees throughout operations, which is a cornerstone of our strategy. Working safely and efficiently is a key component of our efforts to drive sustainable value-creation. Our network metric performance, shown here on slide 19, did trend down in the second quarter due to a number of episodic events that were concentrated in the Southeast. More importantly, our metrics have trended higher in the recent weeks. We are confident we will remain at these high levels, while handling the additional volume and continuing to aggressively pursue productivity initiatives. Our customer-facing metrics are allowing us to have specific data-driven discussions with our customers, deepening our already strong relationships. Moving to some of our productivity initiatives, starting on slide 20. You can see we continued to increase employee productivity, which is driven by optimizing our train plan as well as our improvements in train length. As you may recall, 2016 was a record year for train length, and we are on track to set a new record for the full year of 2017. The second quarter was the highest quarterly train length on record, and June represented the highest monthly train length at Norfolk Southern. This marks the seventh consecutive quarter of sequential improvement, and we are excited to build on our momentum. As shown on slide 21, train length, along with the continued rationalization of our yard and local fleets, has resulted in significant improvements in our locomotive productivity. We removed 150 locomotives from service in 2016 and another 150 so far this year. The second quarter was the highest quarter of locomotive productivity in our company history, and we are on pace to set a new record for the full year. We will continue to actively manage our locomotives to ensure we are driving the highest value for shareholders, while we continue to support the needs of our customers. Not only do these improvements result in lower maintenance cost; they also enhance our fuel efficiency, which I will discuss on slide 22. Our fuel efficiency improved 7% in the second quarter versus the same period last year and resulted in an all-time quarterly record. As you may recall, 2016 was a record year for this measurement. We accomplished this by continuing to improve train lengths, locomotive rationalizations, and implementing our energy management initiatives. Together, these initiatives continue to drive improvements for this measurement. In closing, we are confident we will continue to provide a level of service to our customers that will grow our business, while at the same time driving long-term productivity savings and superior returns for shareholders. We are proud of the accomplishments we have made and continue to identify opportunities to drive additional efficiencies for the benefit of NS shareholders. I will now turn it over to Marta, who will cover our financial achievements. Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin with our summarized second quarter results on slide 24. The continued execution of our strategic plan delivered a 7% increase in revenues, which, when coupled with only a 4% increase in expenses, resulted in more than $100 million of additional operating income, and as Jim noted, an all-time record-low quarterly operating ratio of 66.3%. Turning to the component changes in operating expenses on slide 25. In total, they were higher by $65 million or 4%, as our sustained focus on controlling expenses helped mitigate costs associated with inflation and with the 6% volume increase. Slide 26 highlights the drivers of the variance in Compensation and Benefits, which rose by $36 million or 5% year-over-year. As I mentioned on last quarter's call, inflationary increases continue at a quarterly run rate of $30 million to $35 million, which is higher than historically, primarily due to the large increase in premiums on union medical plans. Also previously noted is an increase in incentive compensation associated with the improvement in operating results. Partially offsetting these items were reduced employee levels, which resulted in $16 million of lower expense, as head count was more than 800 employees lower than the second quarter of 2016 and down almost 400 sequentially. With the efficiency improvements Mike mentioned, we now expect that we can hold overall head count at this lower level for the remainder of the year. Fuel expense, as shown on slide 27, rose by $16 million, entirely attributable to higher prices, which added $18 million. Fuel efficiency continues to improve. And as Mike mentioned, we achieved a record on this metric, which resulted in 2% fewer gallons consumed on 6% more volume. Moving on to Purchased Services and Rents on slide 28. This category was up $8 million or 2% year-over-year, largely due to the increase in intermodal traffic. Slide 29 displays other income, which rose $28 million for the quarter, due principally to higher returns on corporate-owned life insurance and increased income from coal property. Turning to Income Taxes on slide 30. The effective rate for the quarter was 36.3%, unchanged from the second quarter of 2016. Summarizing second quarter earnings on slide 31, net income was $497 million, up 23% compared with 2016; and diluted earnings per share were $1.71, up 26% versus the second quarter of last year. Wrapping up our financial overview on slide 32, free cash flow for the first six months was nearly $700 million, up $200 million versus the prior year. And as Jim noted, with the improvement in cash flow and our confidence in future free cash generation, we have increased our full-year target for share repurchases from $800 million to $1 billion. Thanks for your attention, and I now turn the call back to Jim. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: As evidenced by our record results just a year and a half into our plan, our team is engaged and energized. Having consistently delivered strong performance, we are confident in our ability to reach a sub-65% operating ratio by 2020 or sooner. Additionally, as we reach our targets, we'll continue to achieve improvements that drive shareholder value. Before taking your questions, I want to thank Marta for her many contributions and devoted service over the years, as she will retire from Norfolk Southern on August 1. She's been an outstanding leader in our organization, a terrific member of the management team and instrumental to Norfolk Southern's success. On a personal note, she's also been a trusted partner and a great friend, so it is a bittersweet goodbye for me. Our search for Marta's successor is ongoing. We are working with a nationally recognized executive search firm and are considering both external and internal candidates. While the search continues, the board has elected Tom Hurlbut, currently VP and Controller, to the position of Interim CFO, effective August 1. And with that, we'll now open the line for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Due to the number of analysts joining us in the call today, please ask one primary question and one follow-up question to accommodate as many participants as possible. Our first question today is from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your questions. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks. Good morning. So, I just wanted to ask about the long-term target. It seemed like there was sort of a slight shift in the language. Previously, you've talked about a 65% or below by 2020, and now it's sort of 65% by 2020 or sooner. Should we read anything into that as you're stepping up the operational initiatives as well as various customer projects, or, really, is it just semantics? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Good morning, Allison. Let me start by pointing out again that the second quarter of this year represented our sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year OR improvements and all-time records in both the quarter and for the first half. So, our plan is working as planned, and it's allowing us to deliver a lot of financial improvements through operational gains. So, we are very confident that we can reach our goals. And we're pulling all the levers. We've got the pedal to the metal. And as soon as we can get there, we will. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. So, would you characterize that, with the good results over the last few quarters, as maybe pulling that target forward a little bit? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yeah, things are going really well. The plan is working as planned, and we're making rapid progress. So, yes, we are very confident. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay, great. And then if I could just ask about the third quarter. Historically, the OR is flat to slightly down on a sequential basis. So, as I think about some of the puts and takes in the volume side that you discussed earlier, is that still the right way to think about it, or are there any cost items or other items that might drive a deviation from historical patterns? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: We do feel confident we'll post a lower operating ratio year-over-year in the second half of the year. Now, the pace of improvements quarter-by-quarter will depend on various factors. Long term, obviously, the drivers are our top line growth in productivity, and that doesn't change. Quarter-by-quarter, things like real estate gains can make a difference, can tip the balance. And recall that in the third quarter of last year, we did have a significant real estate gain. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your questions. Jason Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC: Wow. Thank you very much. Could you parse out some of those comments you made about episodic events in the second quarter impacting you a little bit on the negative side? And then maybe talk about how your metrics are trending up and what that can mean on a sequential basis, and how we're looking at your numbers from 2Q to 3Q? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Sure. Well, let me set the backdrop, and then I'll hand it off to Mike to talk about some of the specific things we encountered in the second quarter. You did see network velocity slow down a little bit in the second quarter, and you saw dwell tick up some. We've turned a corner on that. Third quarter, to-date, the metrics are looking good. We are steadfast in our commitment to deliver quality service and customer value. And network performance, even through the second quarter of this year, remained well above 2015 levels. And as I said, it's been trending higher. So, this is the platform for growth. And we are committed to keeping network performance and service performance at a level that allows us to grow and drives productivity as well. So, with that, Mike, why don't you comment a little bit on some of the things we experienced in the second quarter. Michael J. Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yeah. Okay, will do. So, we had really three things that were going on. They were going on pretty close together, but we had a lot of flooding pretty much between Louisville and Kansas City, on that line. During the quarter, we also had some flooding just outside of our Cincinnati terminal, which is a high-volume terminal there. During the quarter, we had some fires going on down in North Florida that were shutting our line down different times during the third quarter. They'd come near the tracks, so we shut the tracks down and opened it back up. So, those three things were going on, dealt with those through the quarter. And we feel very comfortable about how we bounced back. In the last month, our train speed has increased 10% back to prior levels and our dwell's back to what it was prior to some of these stuff. So, feel real comfortable about how we've responded and returned service to where we want it to be. And it continues to trend higher, and we're going to continue to work on that. Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: So, Allison, this is Alan \u2013 or Jason, excuse me. Jason Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC: Jason. Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yeah, excuse me, Jason. So... Jason Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC: She's the better looking one. Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: We have seen improvement since the beginning of the third quarter. We've seen it in our network performance metrics. We've seen it in our customer-facing metrics. And more importantly, as Jim, and Mike, and I get out and talk to our customers, we see it in the feedback from our customers. They sense the improvement. They're seeing the improvement in our service product. Michael J. Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yes. And we're pleased with where it's at, and we're going to continue to keep it there, continue to further improve. Jason Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC: All right. I guess, my follow-up is going to be more on the top line side. We did, as you know, our big Railroad Shipper survey,. And your eastern competitor probably got the worst ratings and service. And we just held dinner last night with some railroad people, and clearly, they're having some service challenges over there. Have you seen freight come over from the other eastern railroads due to poorer-than-expected service, where it can come over? And if it's come over, has it come over at regular pricing, or have you been able to actually increase the pricing on that? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Look, Jason, again, let me just set the stage here, and I'm going to let Alan comment specifically on what's going on with the top line in that regard. But first off, our focus is very much on enhancing value at NSC and driving our plan to continue to drive productivity and growth. And growth is an important part of that plan. We'll take the market share, whether it's from truck or competitors, as long as it complements our network and obviously falls to the bottom line. Those are the keys. So, Alan, what are you seeing in terms of the landscape? Jason Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC: Hey, Alan. Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Jason, we are always talking to our customers. As Jim noted, our primary form of competition is truck. But we're talking to our customers about service products that offer a sustainable view of their markets and allow them to grow. And we have seen some business move over to us. It's a small amount, I'll tell you that, but it's early. We've got a really good service product. The customers value the continuity of our market approach, of our operating philosophy, and our focus on allowing them to grow with their customers. Jason Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay, gentlemen, thank you for the time. And Marta congratulations on the retirement, and best of luck to you. Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah. Good morning, and also wanted to extend the best wishes to you Marta in retirement. Let's see. I guess, the question on rail competition and kind of customer conversations and so forth, you gave us some perspective on that. I think, Alan, you said, it's early. I guess, with the nature of the customer conversations recently, would you say that this is something that's likely to build in terms of the potential for us and business to come over, or would you say, look, business kind of naturally falls to one or the other, and you really shouldn't consider too much in terms of share gain as you look the next couple of quarters? How would you frame that? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yeah. Again, let me do the framing, and then hand it off to Alan. I want to emphasize that we have been in front of our customers a lot. That is just a part of our regular routine. Mike, Alan, and I are in front of our customers all the time. We are going to them. We are in their offices and their conference rooms, hearing about their business and how we can gain more of it. So, that's a big focus for all three of us. We want the feedback from our customers all the time, and we're getting it. So, Alan, talk a little bit more about the market share opportunity. Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: So, we're going to capitalize on opportunities that fit our network. And if customers see that we provide a predictable, efficient service product that meets their needs, whether that's in competition with truck or another rail carrier, then we're going to go after that business, Jim, as long as it fits our network and we can drive value to our shareholders. Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. But when you said, it's early, does that imply that there might be some building in the opportunity, or am I over-reading that comment? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: I'll tell you that the average duration of our contract is three years, and so, it takes time for some things to play out. Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : Right, okay. I guess for the follow-up question, it seems you had weakness in 2015 and 2016 in coal, some other NG-related areas, then you had pretty significant strength year-over-year in the first half. I think we're kind of \u2013 so, the industry's transitioning to a slower pace of growth in volume overall. How does that affect how you would view the opportunity for margin improvement year-over-year, or if you want us to take it and say, we're really focused on productivity? Just trying to think about how we think of those two things, productivity or improvement, as you may have a slower year-over-year volume growth backdrop looking forward. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Let me comment generally. With respect to our coal customers, as with all of our customers, our goal is to serve them. And that means having the resources available to serve them, when the demand is there, when they need our service. So, we are committed to that. We're committed to serving our coal customers as with all our other customers as well. Alan, in terms of resource deployment and market opportunity, what are you seeing? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Well, Tom, within coal, I was with several of our coal customers just last week, and there is optimism, particularly on the export side for continued strength throughout the year. As you know, the benchmark moved in the mid-140s to $175 just within a span of a couple of weeks as the Chinese reported record steel production in June. I was also with some intermodal customers, and they're commenting about how they're starting to see tightness in the truck market. That's important for us, because as we've noted, truck is our primary form of competition, and so as you see spot rates move up double digit within the last couple of months and maybe start to move above contract rates, that portends well for both volume and pricing opportunities for us into 2018. Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks so much for taking my questions. First one is on the automotive business. You mentioned the headwind from auto production in the second half, but General Motors production, specifically, I think is expected to be down as much as 20% in the third quarter. That's not necessarily organic. I guess, it's due to the change over their light truck platform. I think you guys have some disproportionate exposure there on the Fort Wayne line, if you could just talk about the impact there. I think it'll probably be one-time given the changeover effect, but any color on maybe what that could have in terms of revenue growth, and then also fixed cost absorption in the automotive franchise. That would be helpful. Thank you. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Automotive production in the U.S. declined 6.5% in the second quarter. It's supposed to be down 9.3% in the third quarter. That's the largest year-over-year decline that is currently being projected. And so, consequently, we see a decline within our automotive volumes, particularly in the third quarter. Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, I know that, but the question was really on the disproportionate exposure to General Motors and the fact that that business is going to be down 20%. What type of impact that may have disproportionally to your exposure in the auto business? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: We're not going to discuss specific customer relationships. I think I've given you some good color as to what we see within our automotive market for the back half of the year. Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. That's fair. And then one follow-up with me, just piggybacking on the last question with respect to OR expansion in the back half. I mean, the contribution margins \u2013 the incremental margins in the first half have just been unbelievably strong. Those productivity initiatives have definitely dropped to the bottom line, and then the business obviously, really capital-intensive. But just a question on your ability to maintain the incremental margins that you did in the first half in the second half. Obviously, mixes, volumes are not going to be as strong as they were in the first half. But then the productivity and the head count will stay flat sequentially. So, just the puts and takes there in terms of your ability to maintain incremental margins maybe in the neighborhood of where they were in the first half, that'd be helpful. Thank you. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: The key is the plan's dynamism and flexibility. And that's what we have done for the last year and a half. We have responded to changing business conditions as necessary to continue driving results. And so, when necessary, we'll lean into productivity. And for the long term, it's all about a multidimensional approach, a combination of growth and productivity at any given time. Maybe it's a little bit more growth; maybe it's a little bit more productivity. So, we'll be flexible. Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. All right, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions. Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Can you just comment on pricing in the second quarter and kind of the gap to inflation, kind of how you see that evolving through the year, because it does look like inflation was higher in the second quarter and is probably going to accelerate into the second half of the year? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yeah. Our rate of year-over-year pricing growth in the second quarter was consistent with what we saw in the first quarter. And the rate of year-over-year pricing growth was consistent with what we saw in 2016. So, we're committed to focusing on price and recognizing the value of the service product that we provide, and we're committed to pricing long-term above inflation. Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: But do you feel like you're going to get there in the second half of this year as well? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yes. Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. And as a follow-up, in the intermodal market, are you confident that the rising tide of pricing in all of trucking will help intermodal pricing over time? I'm just wondering if there's enough overlap between the kind of mom-and-pop truckers who are most impacted by ELDs and the intermodal market as it stands right now? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yeah. We are very confident that it's going to provide pricing opportunity for us, and it's going to provide volume opportunities for us. We've got great channel partners out there, who are working to grow their business. And we've got a service product and schedules that support their growth. Now, most of that growth from ELDs will come in 2018. Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. Makes sense. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter, Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch (US): Great. Good morning. And, also, congrats to Marta on her retirement. Great working with you over the years. Michael or Jim, can you talk about the experience on the hump yard in Chattanooga? You shut it down. Did you convert that to a flat yard? Did you shift the business elsewhere? Just want to understand, is that replicable as you think about your network, or was this just from maybe shrinking business in that region, and you didn't need it, and you moved it elsewhere? Can you maybe walk though a little bit about that? Michael J. Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Sure will. So, we idled the hump, but we are using that yard, and it's in a great location for us, because it has a lot of feeder lines from our network going into it to do block swapping. So, while we idled the hump, we now do a lot more block swapping, we do more blocking further into the network. So, it is giving us good productivity, because the cars are getting through there faster and providing even better service, because of less time on the network getting to the customers. So, that's the piece to it, where it's a big yard in a great location, to be able to do a large amount of block swapping. Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch (US): And, again, Michael, maybe your thoughts on, is that something that's replicable to other yards? I mean, you talked about the number of hump yards in the past. Is that something you plan on continuing the conversions to other yards? Michael J. Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.: We continue to look at it. It has to make sense. It has to end up getting traffic through the network faster and taking cost out, or a balance between the two. And we're only going to do if it hits those criteria. Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch (US): So, when you look at this example, is it something that's accelerating, and you look at it, and say, we're going to do more, or is this just a one-off? I just want to understand if this is something you can replicate to your other yards. Michael J. Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yeah. And we can replicate it to other yards. It may be in yards that aren't necessarily hump yards and do more of the block swapping in locations where it makes sense, something we've been doing over the last couple of years. But we've done it more aggressively lately, and this is one piece of it. And we're doing it more aggressively at other locations. Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch (US): All right. Great. Marta, if I can have a follow-up with you on your employee levels, you talked about being flat going forward. Maybe talk about the cost per employee impacts there. You talked about a couple of things that drove costs up in the quarter. Can you talk about that up 8% year-over-year on a cost per employee base? Is that something you look to continue in the back half of the year, or is there something that can maybe slow down on the increased cost? Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Well, Ken, the cost per employee was up in the second quarter as you noticed, and it was up for two reasons. One of them is the one we've been talking about all year, and that's the 5% inflation, which is higher than normal inflation. And the other factor why in the second quarter the cost per employee was up was due to the incentive comp. And you should expect to see the increase in incentive comp continue in the third and fourth quarters. Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch (US): All right. Thank you. Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: You're welcome. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Wanted to talk a little bit about productivity and sort of the progress to the $100 million target that you talked about. Can you give us a sense of sort of how far along in that you are so far through the year and maybe some of the potential variability, the drivers in the second half of the year, particularly in a slightly lower or potentially meaningfully lower volume growth environment? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: We're making excellent progress in productivity. You saw Mike's data points there : record locomotive productivity; record fuel productivity; and across-the-board significant cost savings, as a result. So, we're going to continue to push. We're not done. We will continue to strive for ever better productivity performance in all of the areas where it matters most : employees; and locomotives; and fuel efficiency; and facilities and so on. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. I guess, trying to get a sense, do you think there's sort of upside potential to that $100 million? I don't know sort of how you're thinking about sort of the ability to \u2013 I know you talked about it being continually adjustable, but just kind of curious about that. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yeah, we think we'll be able to do better than the $100 million. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. Appreciate it. And then a quick follow-up on coal, and specifically, thinking about sort of the export market. Alan, you mentioned sort of an increase in the seaborne prices. When you think about sort of the second half or maybe more specifically about the third quarter, should we see yields in coal collectively, kind of mirror what we saw in the second quarter? Just trying to get some sense around that, because there's been some volatility with the mix of your business; and sort of exports, when they're moving and when they're not. Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Hey, Chris, very good questions. So, the seaborne price in the second quarter of the year was closer to about $200 a metric ton; now, it's closer to $175. And so, within export, there will be pressure on pricing, although we still expect and are confident that it's going to be up year-over-year. The rest of the impact on RPU is going to just be highly dependent upon the mix within our utility franchise, and whether we handle more U-South or more U-North. Last year, we were handling \u2013 about 55% of our utility coal was U-South, which tends to be longer-haul and higher-rated. This quarter, it was about 50/50, so that puts pressure on RPU also. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: And 50/50 is probably a good number to use going forward for this year? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: It's going to be dependent on the weather, Chris. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks for the time. I appreciate it. Operator : The next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your questions. Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.: Thanks, and good morning. Maybe to follow up first on that last question. I wanted to ask about your expectation for consolidated RPU going forward. I know there a lot of moving pieces, but when you think about export coal likely to moderate sequentially, intermodal looking like it will be the leader in terms of near-term volume growth. Just from a directional standpoint, do you think that RPU ex fuel can still be up year-over-year in the second half? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: I think, we've given you a lot of inputs on it, Justin. If you look at our RPU for our seven major commodity groups in the second quarter, it was up between 2% and 5%, and our total RPU was up 1%. So, it's heavily influenced by mix. I've given you some guidance on our utility coal volumes, our export coal volumes, what we're seeing in intermodal, and what we're seeing in merchandise. So, we're very confident in our approach to pricing and the level of year-over-year price increases we get. The overall RPU for the corporation that falls out is going to be heavily dependent upon those mix factors. Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. And maybe to follow up on some of the market share questions earlier. I was curious if there were any major contract wins or losses during the quarter that we should keep in mind for the back half of this year in 2018? And then as a follow-up to that, looking out over the next 12 months, how much of your total book of business do you expect to reprice? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Hi, Justin. As I talked about, any market share shift that we've seen so far in the early stages is pretty minimal. It's there, but it's minimal. So far, for this year, we've got \u2013 about 80% of our revenue is committed. Most of what is uncommitted so far for the remainder of this year is in export. And in any given year, we're going to renegotiate about 50% to 60% of our revenues. Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.: Great. That's really helpful. I appreciate the time today. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC. Please proceed with your questions. Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. Just wanted to go back to coal for a moment. And I know it's difficult to forecast out, but you've given us good color into the back half of the year. As you're situating and talking to your customers about 2018 and kind of assuming no significant changes in weather patterns, how are stockpile levels among your customers that would give you indication as to just directionally on both export and domestic utility? Do you expect it'd be higher, lower, or about the same compared to the 2017 levels? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Walter, good question. So, right now, stockpile levels at utilities that we serve, and this is a publicly available number, are about 15 days below where they were last year. However, we recognize they're still 21 days above target. So, we've made a lot of improvement over the last 12 months in the stockpile levels. June was very mild, and that significantly impact coal burn to the negative. Last year, in June, stockpiles dropped by about six days. This year, they only dropped by about one day. So, as I think, about the outlook going forward, July has been hot. Natural gas prices, while down versus June, are still up above where they were this time last year. And so, it's going to be heavily dependent upon how the rest of the summer weighs out in terms of load demand and natural gas prices. And that's just a function of the fact of coal being a load follower. Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: Right. So, too early to tell even directionally, which way you see coal going in 2018? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: It's going to be heavily dependent upon how the summer plays out. We had a very, very hot summer last year, and that really benefited our volumes and our utility coal franchise through the second half of last year and through the first quarter of this year. Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: Okay. Fair enough. Just housekeeping now for Marta. Other income run rate, I know it moves around a lot. Is there even an annual number? I know you kind of dipped down last year from $100 million down to $70 million and now maybe turning back up at around over $100 million. Is there kind of a run rate even on an annual level we can plug in there? And also, tax rate going into 2018. Are you seeing any major changes in the guidance you've given for this year going into 2018? Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Well, Walter, you have it about right. And looking at last few years' estimate, about $100 million. As you know, there's a lot of different pieces in there. So, estimating that for the annual is probably the best thing you can do, looking at the recent years' average. And then what was your question? Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: And there's tax where you've been guiding us at kind of around 36%, but longer term you talked a bit about 37%. So, we're using a 36% for the back half of the year and 37%, 2018 and beyond. Is there any reason why we should change that? Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: I'm glad you asked that question, too, because you should be using a 37% for the full year. And it has been lower in the first half for the reasons we discussed in the first quarter. In the third quarter, we expect an increase above 37%, because there's a State Tax Law change, which is increasing their income tax rate, and therefore, we expect to have about $13 million of additional, because we have to adjust our deferred taxes. So, when you work that into the mix for the full year, we expect the rate to be about 37%. Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: Okay. That's great. And 37% into 2018 as well? Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yes, sir. Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions. Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for taking my question. And congrats, Marta. Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Thank you. Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Would be nice. So, I wanted to come back to the first question on this call, Jim, or maybe even Marta, on the sequential outcome in OR. If I look back maybe last five or six years, I think you guys are averaging a back half OR that's down maybe a 100 basis points to 200 basis points sequentially. But you guys did talk about sequential declines in metals. We've talked about the coal situation with exports most likely coming down, and head count being flat from here. I mean, should we think that, that normal relationship holds this year, or do those items potentially mean it's less or more? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: As I said, we do expect a lower second half operating ratio versus 2016. Now, quarter-by-quarter, things like the timing of real estate gains, which are difficult to predict, can tip the balance versus the prior year. And also, bear in the mind that in the third quarter of last year, we did have a significant real estate gain. Now, long term, it's all about growth and productivity, those will be the drivers of improved operating ratio and earnings. Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Jim. And, I guess, following up from that, how important is volume growth in 2018 to maintaining the trajectory on OR improvement? Let's just say, we have another dull year and can't get hotter growth from the network, is that going to push plans back a bit? You've talked a lot about the dynamic plans, so what can be dynamic about it next year if we don't see growth for the industry? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Sure. Volume growth is certainly one piece of the puzzle. Pricing is another in the top line, and then it's all about expense control and driving productivity. We demonstrated the ability to drive productivity to the benefit of a lower operating ratio and earnings growth in 2016 when we didn't see much volume growth. And that's what we'll do again if that's the way 2018 plays out. Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your questions. Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Yeah. Thank you. I wanted to drill down a little bit more on the merchandise portfolio. I think it's pretty well-understood the challenges you're seeing in auto, some of the challenges that you're seeing in another parts of that portfolio, but also, some of the growth you're seeing in the frac sand business. But if we can take a step back and maybe think about the industrial merchandise, the non-crude chemicals, the paper and forest products, that-kind of core industrial business, what's the outlook for these non sort of specific issues you're focused in? Do you think we'll see growth in those parts of the portfolio in the second half of the year, and what are you hearing from customers? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Bascome, what we're hearing from customers is there's optimism. Certainly, the plastics franchise will continue to be strong for us, as polyethylene plants come online. Lumber has been impacted by tariffs and kind of an inventory overhang. We think that'll unwind itself in the third quarter, but that'll put pressure on third quarter volumes. Ag is going to be dependent upon crops. We participated in soybean exports last year. Now, while that's less than 0.3% of our overall revenue, we're probably not going to have as much of a soybean export program this year, because South American production has been so strong. Generally though, if you look at things, industrial production has improved each of the last five months, and manufacturing seems to have firmed. So, longer term, we're focused on growing this part of our franchise, that's why our industrial development department is so critical to what we do. And you heard Jim talk about it. Our pipeline is very robust for new projects, probably more robust than it's been since the Great Recession. Now, that won't necessarily drive volumes this year, but that's longer-term growth opportunities. To us, that indicates confidence on the part of our customers in the economy and confidence on the part of our customers and doing business with Norfolk Southern over the long term. Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : I appreciate that comprehensive answer there. Just wanted to clarify. I think you said you expect merchandise volumes to be down low to mid-single digits year-over-year in the third quarter. Can you just confirm that? Go ahead. Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yeah, Bascome, that's what I said. Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Yeah. And if I look sequentially, that implies a little weaker quarter-over-quarter trend than you typically see in the book as a whole. Is that just a function of some of the auto pressure, is there something else going on there, or maybe even some conservatism? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yeah, Bascome, that is a function of the auto pressure. It's also, as I noted, second quarter steel volumes were benefited from a slight inventory rebuilding. And you've seen steel prices and capacity factors pulled back in May and June. Now, they've improved a little bit in July, so we'll see how that plays out. But it also reflects a little bit of pressure on steel in the third quarter. Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please, proceed with your questions. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Scott. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : So, just wanted to follow up there just on this kind of auto, steel discussion. Obviously, we can see that auto is 9% of your total revenue this quarter. But when you think about the derivatives that go into the auto sector, what percentage of your total business do you think is tied to autos? And as we think about autos and steel, and maybe some of the other derivatives falling in the back half, should we think about those as having higher or lower than normal incremental margins? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Scott, there are some inputs into it. Certainly, carbon black or plastics or steel are the primary ones. Auto doesn't make up a material portion of our volumes in those groups, but if there's a pull-back in auto, that'll have a little bit of pressure in those markets. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : But is there any way to say like so, yeah, direct autos are 9% of the business, but we add up all the derivatives that total exposure to autos is 15% or 20%, I don't know, is there any way that you could just try and help put that in perspective? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: It's not a material number. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : You're saying not materially above the 9% that we can see that's directly auto? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Right. It does have an impact, but it's \u2013 you've noted a 9% to 15% or 20%. It's not in that range. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Okay, good. And then just on the utility coal side, utility coal volumes were up 23% in the second quarter. It looks like the guidance for the third quarter is that utility coal is going to be down year-over-year. I'm surprised down, just given that you still have the contract win from CSX. So, did we hear that right, and given that dynamic and then what you talked about on the export side, do you think RPU and coal is positive or negative in aggregate in the third quarter? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Scott, you did hear that right. That's exactly how I guided. If you recall, third quarter of last year, we saw a significant jump in our coal volume sequentially from about 15 million tons in second quarter of last year to over 18 million tons in the third quarter of this year. That benefited from a very hot start to the summer, including June. We haven't seen that this year. And so, that puts pressure on our utility coal volumes in the quarter. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : And then just \u2013 so, given that dynamic of utility coal down, export up, but export rates falling a little bit. In aggregate, do you think coal RPU is positive or negative year-over-year in the third? I know you said exports positive, I'm just trying to think in aggregate for coal? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: We won't guide the specific RPUs in specific markets on a quarterly basis, but you've got all the right thoughts there in terms of the moving parts. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. All right. Thank you, guys. Appreciate it. And best of luck to you, Marta. Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please proceed with your questions. Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities, Inc.: Thanks very much, and good morning. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Good morning. Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities, Inc.: Wanted to ask a question about your strategy of integrating more closely with customers across the supply chain. Can you talk about how broadly you're approaching that? Have you started with a few key customers, or a few key business lines, or is it more general than that? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Well, we did begin by doing some focus groups with key customers across various parts of our business. And then we have taken that feedback, along with feedback we have received from a bigger group of customers. And some of that feedback has been informal, as we've been out there meeting and talking with our customers; some of it has been more formalized. We took all of that. We have been working on redesigning our customer interfaces, our equipment strategies, sitting down with the customers about service parameters. What do you consider to be service excellence? Well, that's what we are going to try to deliver. And so, it's been a very broad-based and comprehensive effort to taking our customers' feedback, to understand their service needs, and to redesign our network around what they want. Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities, Inc.: And just by way of a quick follow-up, as we go forward, how do you plan to internally measure success? Is it economy plus growth or some other metric? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Well, a couple of dimensions there, certainly, one measure of success would be how we are doing from a service standpoint relative to the shared KPIs we have developed with our customers. And then, we will recognize success in both top line growth and margin expansion \u2013 margin expansion and bottom line growth. I mean, that's the key, obviously, is to garner revenue growth that translates to better margins and a better bottom line. Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you for the time, and my best wishes to Marta as well. Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions. Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Good morning. Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I just had a quick one on PTC, Positive Train Control. If you can just give us a sense of where you are this year in terms of OpEx and D&A. What's in the 2017 numbers? And when you look forward to 2020, obviously, there's still a lot of moving parts, the system's being developed and tested, but I imagine you have some idea what's baked into your 2020 guidance. So, can you just kind of give us a starting point where you're at now and where you expect that to settle in 2020 when the system comes online? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Well, let me comment on the state of implementation, and then I'll turn it over to Marta to address the expense components. So, we're making excellent progress on PTC. We do expect to meet the deadlines and have the system fully installed next year. And then, we will begin then to turn it on across the board. So, everything is going very well in terms of the implementation. Longer term, we're seeing an opportunity to utilize PTC in various ways. So, that's all a good thing. Now, Marta, why don't you talk about the expense components of PTC going forward? Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Certainly, well, the first thing to note is that the PTC-related costs are included in our long-range guidance. And so, Mike's folks have estimated what they think the cost will be associated with that and has included it in all of our plans. So, now, with regard particularly to this year, we expect that we'll have \u2013 we have included in depreciation, probably about $60 million. Going forward, upon total completion, it'll probably be about $100 million, but again, it's in our expectation. With regard to the maintenance cost, the way his team is approaching that is to include the PTC maintenance for the years going forward as part of our overall maintenance budget. So, we don't have a specific number for that, because they're integrating the work in with their other work. Mike, do you have anything to add to that? Michael J. Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.: No, but from a dollar standpoint, it's not a material increase in those costs. But again, it's already... Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Because, you're incorporating it into... Michael J. Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yeah, incorporated into, and it's already in our 2020 plan. Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. So, it sounds like the biggest increases then come from just depreciating the assets that you're putting into place, and you feel like part of the maintenance you can kind of leverage with what you're already doing on the network? Marta R. Stewart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yes. I mean, it certainly has additional extra work with it, but they're going to incorporate it with it. And going forward, of course, for reporting purposes in the R-1 and so forth, we will break out the portion that's PTC. But, again, the important point that Mike and I are both making is that it is integrated with our plan. Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. And then just a quick follow-up for Alan. You talked about the trucking market getting tighter in 2018, and you posted record intermodal volumes this quarter. So, maybe if you can just talk a little bit more about the international side, some of the port activity picking up on the East Coast, investments being made, bridges being raised, that sort of thing, how those partnerships are progressing, and when you might expect to see some of that activity? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Hey, Brian, good question. We've got some great relationships with our steamship lines and our port partners. And we've benefited from the shift of volume from the West Coast to East Coast. Our imports through the East Coast are up 13% in the quarter. And so, we have seen already the benefit of that growth in volume and expect to continue to do so. Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks for your time this morning. Operator : Our next question is from the line of John Larkin with Stifel. Please proceed with your questions. John Griffith Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks for taking my question. Good morning, everybody. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: John. John Griffith Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And best wishes to you, Marta. Just wanted to ask a bit of a brain teaser on the RPU math. I think, Alan, you'd mentioned that of the top seven commodity groups, the RPU there has risen year-over-year somewhere between 2% and 4% depending upon the commodity group, yet the overall RPU growth is up 1%. Could you explain what I'm missing there in terms of that translation from a bunch of groups growing 2% to 4%, yet the overall is growing at only 1%. Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yeah. John, it's a mix impact. RPU is up between 2% and 5% for each of our seven commodity groups year-over-year in the second quarter. However, if a large percentage of your volume growth is in lower-rated intermodal, while intermodal RPU can be up 4%, it'll have a drag on the overall RPU for the company. So, that's an important fact to remember as we look at RPU. It isn't always reflective of price or of value to the corporation. John Griffith Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. That is very helpful. And then just maybe a follow-on regarding the PTC line of questioning, a couple of questioners ago. As you look out, it's pretty clear that you planned out through 2020 and maybe beyond. As that PTC CapEx begins to fall off and you have gotten the network into great shape and made a lot of the operational changes that you're going through now, where do you see the sort of long-run CapEx settling out as a percentage of revenue? There is one railroad you're aware of, I'm sure, that has targeted sort of a 15% number. Is that a sustainable number and reasonable to apply to Norfolk Southern, or do you have a different dynamic at work? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Well, John, post-PTC, we do see CapEx coming down somewhat as a share of revenue, for example. Exactly where that lands, I think we'll have to see. Really, there's no fixed ideology there. Our goal is to invest as much as we possibly can and generate shareholder value and appropriate return on capital. So, that's the goal, but as much, but not more than we can, while generating excellent returns. So, I think we'll see. It's likely to come down post-PTC, but again, it's really all about paying close attention to the return on capital, make sure we're generating an appropriate return and investing just enough to do that. John Griffith Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Sounds terrific. Thanks very much. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning. Alan, maybe, when you talk about the tightening of the truck market, as you think about how that's going to impact core price, and maybe even volume a little bit, when should we start to expect that to come in if we see this sort of sustained tightening of the truck market that some of the truckers are talking about right now? When should it show up in the Norfolk P&L or core pricing metrics? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: David, I believe that'll start to show up in 2018. It'll have to be reflected through trucking bid season later in the year, and then so we'll start to see it in our contract negotiations later in the year and into next year. Potentially, we could start to see it in volume later in the year, but you'll see it in pricing in 2018. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. And then maybe just a quick follow-up. I think, in talking to some guys who are on the coal field, there is a little bit of speculation that the recent uptick in the met coal settlement is a result of U.S. miners maybe not having the capacity to just pull out more production for met. Are you hearing anything about the supply constraints kind of restricting availability of U.S. met coal exports, or is that something that you feel your customers are going to be able to respond to if demand stays strong? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: I think, a lot of what we've heard is it's a result of the increase in Chinese steel production. And the Australians have taken some production offline, they guided to that. We're going to continue to watch production. And David, to your point, production is going to limit probably our export volume in the second half of the year. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: But that should still give you an ability to kind of benefit from the price without the volume, though, right? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yes. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Right. Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: It will. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: All right. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I will turn the floor back to Jim Squires for closing comments. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Well, thank you, everyone, for your questions today. We look forward to speaking with you again in October. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And we thank you for your participation.",

Operator : Greetings, and welcome to the Norfolk Southern Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Clay Moore, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Moore. You may begin. Claiborne Moore - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Thank you, Rob, and good morning. Before we begin, please note that during today's call, we may make certain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risk and uncertainties and may differ materially from actual results. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. The slides of the presenters are available on our website at norfolksouthern.com in the Investor Section, along with our non-GAAP reconciliation. Additionally, a transcript and downloads will be posted after the call. Now, it is my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's Chairman, President and CEO, Jim Squires. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Norfolk Southern's third quarter 2017 earnings call. Joining me today are Alan Shaw, Chief Marketing Officer; Mike Wheeler, Chief Operating Officer and Cindy Earhart, Chief Financial Officer. It is with great pleasure that I introduce Cindy to our quarterly calls. She brings a strong diverse background to this role. I look forward to her contributions as we continue to execute our strategies centered on safety, service, stewardship and growth. Highlighting our third quarter results on slide 4; net income was $506 million, up 10% from prior year and earnings per share increased 13% to $1.75. Our third quarter operating ratio decreased by 160 basis points to an all-time quarterly record of 65.9%. Our third quarter results are an extension of the performance delivered throughout the year resulting in a record 67.4% operating ratio and record earnings per share of $4.93 for the nine-month period. These results demonstrate the successful execution of our proactive strategies and initiatives. Our continual focus on delivering results through cost saving efforts, efficiencies, and asset utilization have us on track to deliver productivity savings of over $100 million in 2017. The unrelenting focus and resolve of our employees on delivering upon the goals we set out in our strategic plan is evident in our achievements to-date. As shown on slide 5, for seven consecutive quarters, we have lowered the operating ratio on a year-over-year basis. We continue to make demonstrable progress toward achieving a sub-65% operating ratio. Our team remains committed to ongoing productivity initiatives and the pursuit of additional opportunities for improvement. And for these efforts, I am confident that we will reach that goal by 2020 or sooner. We remain focused on both resource utilization and growth, as we continue to successfully execute our multidimensional strategy. Our third quarter volumes increased by 4%, while average head count was reduced by 4% versus last year's levels. We are resolute in our commitment to deliver a quality service product that our customer value and will provide opportunities for growth. Now, Alan will provide a marketing overview, Mike will detail our operational performance and Cindy will summarize our financial results. Then we'll take your questions. With that I'll now turn the program over to Alan. Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Thank you, Jim, and good morning everyone. Our third quarter 2017 revenue growth in all three business units reflects the strength and sustainability of our strategic plan. Total revenue for the quarter was up 6% versus 2016 driven by a combination of volume gains in intermodal, coal and steel and increased pricing. Merchandise volume was down slightly in the third quarter as gains in steel, sand and fertilizers were more than offset by lower automotive shipments associated with U.S. vehicle production declines and reduced crude oil shipments. Overall merchandise revenue was up 3% this quarter as negotiated price increases outpaced volume losses. Intermodal revenue increased $46 million, or 8% versus the same period in 2016, resulting from highway conversions, organic growth with our existing customers and new service offerings. Intermodal achieved record volume for the second consecutive quarter as total units once again topped the 1 million unit mark. Our intermodal growth in the third quarter is the result of our market approach, which aligns our service product with the needs of our customers, enhancing their ability to grow while positioning Norfolk Southern as an integral part of their supply chain. Coal posted year-over-year revenue and volume growth primarily due to increased export coal volume and pricing. Coal RPU was up 1% due to the impact of pricing gains that were partially offset by negative mix. Higher growth rates and lower rated export steam negatively impacted RPU despite improved pricing in our export markets. Utility volume decreased as mild weather caused an approximate 15% year-over-year decline in overall coal burn in eastern utilities. Turning to slide 8. We look ahead to the remainder of the year with confidence based on current economic trends. In merchandise, we expect low single-digit growth in the fourth quarter. Industrial production is likely to drive demand in steel, while growth in construction will positively impact our aggregate volume. Further, we expect increased drilling activity in the Marcellus/Utica region will continue to drive growth in frac sand. These increases will be offset by declines in automotive and by a lower crude oil, which is adversely impacted by pipeline activity. Intermodal expectations remained strong as tight trucking capacity should be further impacted by the ELD implementation in December. We continue to enhance our service offerings, providing growth opportunities with our customers to further drive revenue, volume and shareholder value. In coal, we expect fourth quarter utility volume to be in the range of 15 million to 17 million tons impacted by the mild summer weather. Export tonnage should continue to exceed last year's with volume in the range of 5 million to 6 million tons. We remain focused on pricing in all of our markets. Current indicators point to higher levels of demand and tighter truck capacity for the remainder of the year continuing into 2018. Such an environment increases our value in the marketplace, and we are confident that improvement will be reflected in our pricing. Moving to slide 9. Our market approach and current opportunities are consistent with our strategic plan, offering a balance of safety, service, productivity, and growth to drive shareholder value. To execute this plan, we deliver customer-centric service product that adapts to the needs of our customers, while providing an environment, in which, it is easy to do business. Our customer-centric service product first focuses on tailoring the right service to our customers. We collaborate with our customers to develop the best product that is beneficial to both our shareholders and customers. We pay close attention to customer feedback and continue to make adjustments to meet their needs, viewing our product through the lens of our customers. Our goal is to enhance the competitiveness of our customers in an evolving marketplace, allowing them to quickly adapt and compete for growth, increasing revenue to Norfolk Southern, while strengthening our role in their supply chain. Lastly, we employ best-in-class industrial development team to help customers locate or expand on our lines, providing a future pipeline for growth. The continuity of our management team, operating philosophy, and longstanding customer relationships combined with improving the customer experience and product is the overarching theme of our growth initiatives. We are confident this approach differentiates our service product, allows us to compete with truck, and will continue to provide the revenue and volume growth and shareholder value we delivered this quarter. Thank you. And now, I'll turn it over to, Mike, for an update on operations. Michael J. Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Thank you, Alan, and good morning. Our service levels are delivering growth consistent with our strategic plan. As shown on slide 11, there were significant milestones achieved in the quarter as well as the first three quarters of the year. Our achievements in reducing train accidents combined with our improvements in train length, locomotive productivity and fuel efficiency all helped to drive a record operating ratio. Turning to the key drivers of our success on slide 12. The safety of our employees in the communities we serve continues to be our top priority. Our reportable and serious injury ratios are stable and we are on pace to achieve our lowest train accident frequency on record. For service, we achieved sequential improvement in our network performance metrics. Specifically, our service composite metric is back near 80%, which points to resiliency in our operation. This is particularly notable given volume was up sequentially, while we also successfully controlled costs. Our current service levels are allowing us to not only take on short-term opportunities, but also positions us to have more impactful discussions with our customers concerning long-term opportunities. Moving to some of our key productivity initiatives on slide 13. We are driving improvement in all areas. Our continued rationalization of our yard and local fleets has resulted in significant improvements in our locomotive productivity. The third quarter was the highest quarter of locomotive productivity in our company's history and we are on pace to beat last year's record performance. Not only do these improvements result in lower maintenance cost, they also enhance our fuel efficiency, which improved 4% in the quarter and was an all-time quarterly record. As you may recall, 2016 was a record year for this measure and we are on track to set a new record this year. These measures have been driven by optimizing our train plan and are improvements in train lengths, which is something we must balance with service. As you may recall, 2016 was a record year for this measure and we are on track to set a new record for the full year. In closing, we are confident we will continue to provide a level of service to our customers that will grow our business while at the same time driving sustainable productivity savings and superior returns for shareholders. We are proud of our accomplishments and continue to identify opportunities to drive additional efficiencies for the benefit of NS shareholders. I will now turn it over to Cindy who will cover our financial achievements. Cindy Cynthia Earhart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Thank you, Mike. Good morning everyone. As Mike and Alan have discussed we continue to execute on our long-term strategy and the operating results from the third quarter show we are; 1) reducing costs; 2) driving productivity; and 3) growing the company. On slide 15, you'll see we delivered a record quarterly operating ratio of 65.9%, a 160 basis point improvement over third quarter 2016. We accomplished this by growing revenues 6% as Alan described, while holding expenses to a 3% increase resulting in an 11% rise in income from railway operations. Now turning to the component changes and operating expenses on slide 16. In total, operating expenses were higher by $55 million or 3%. Notwithstanding the 4% increase in volume, improved productivity helped to offset higher inflation. The area of largest variance in the quarter, Compensation and Benefits rose by $64 million, or 9% year-over-year. There are two primary reasons for the increase. First, improved operating results led to an increase in incentive compensation of $47 million over the third quarter 2016. And second, inflationary increases continue at a quarterly run rate of about $30 million, which is higher than historical inflation. As discussed in previous quarters, the increase is primarily due to the large increase in premiums on union medical plans. Partially offsetting these items were reduced employee levels, which saved $26 million. Headcount was about 1,100 employees lower than the third quarter of 2016 and down over 300 sequentially. Year-over-year, we are handling more shipments with fewer people. We expect to enter 2018 with employment levels flat to slightly higher than where we are now, as we hire and train T&E employees ahead of the 2018 peak demand months in summer and fall. Fuel expense rose $17 million entirely attributable to higher prices which added $20 million. The average price per gallon for locomotive fuel was $1.70 this year versus $1.51 in the third quarter of 2016. Sustained improvements in fuel efficiency resulted in 2% fewer gallons consumed on 4% more volume. As Mike mentioned, we posted record fuel efficiency metrics and we expect our ongoing initiatives to further increase train lengths and reduce fuel consumption to support continued improvement. Purchased Services and Rents decreased $9 million, or 2% year-over-year. Equipment rents decreased by $6 million due to lower automotive traffic and improved equipment utilization. The Materials and Other category decreased $24 million, or 13% year-over-year. Lower equipment and roadway material usage drove over half of the decrease. As we reduced the locomotive fleet in service, locomotive repair costs have decreased. Third quarter 2017 also included $9 million more from gains on the sale of operating properties. Moving to slide 17 which shows the full income statement. You can see the strong operating results fell to the bottom line producing net income of $506 million, up 10% compared with 2016 and diluted earnings per share were $1.75, a 13% improvement. Wrapping up our financial overview on slide 18, we continue to return value to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Free cash flow was $1.2 billion for the first nine months and over $1.2 billion has been returned to shareholders. As we announced last month, the board increased our share repurchase authority by 50 million shares and extended the program through 2022. Our financial results for the quarter demonstrates our continued focus on cost reduction, productivity and growth. Thanks for your attention. And I'll turn the call back to Jim for closing remarks. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Thank you, Cindy. As we head towards the end of 2017, we remain as committed and energized as we were at the onset of our plan to deliver sustainable changes that will improve bottom line results for shareholders. Our plan is dynamic and flexible and provides an adaptive platform that will be the foundation of success for our employees, customers, and shareholders. We have consistently delivered strong performance and we are confident in our ability to achieve further improvements and reach our objectives that will drive shareholder value. With that, we'll now open the line for Q&A. Operator? Operator : Thank you. Our first question will be coming from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks. Good morning. I was wondering if you could speak to your view on the tightness in the truck market and how you think that could help results in 2018 from both a volume perspective and a price perspective. And then sort of along the same lines, in terms of potential share gains from CSX, could you elaborate or provide some color on what you think you received from them and how much you would expect to keep or give back? Thanks. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Well, let's take the truck capacity question first. It certainly is an encouraging environment. We are seeing truck capacity tight and getting tighter. Alan, why don't you provide some specifics? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yeah. Allison, as you know, we've clearly stated that our primary form of competition is truck. And within the East, we have a unique opportunity to divert shipments away from the highway to rail. Obviously, within intermodal container, but also within a boxcar, within a (20: 19), and within a multi-level and as truck capacity tightens, and that's the narrative that we hear from our customers on a daily basis that has volume implications for us and importantly it has pricing implications. Certainly I think we're seeing some of that volume matriculate to us now and the pricing will continue into 2018, as our customers and we go through bid season. With respect to share gains, once again our primary form of competition is truck. We are going to put out a very dependable service product and a very consistent approach. We feel like our customers value that approach. And so that has been reflected in our volumes and in our revenue. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Great. And then just a follow-up, as you think about just sort of the whole pricing umbrella. Are you seeing an underlying acceleration in your core pricing growth, whether \u2013 I guess compared to the second quarter? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: As we're renegotiating contracts in the third quarter, we see more strength, particularly on the truck competitive business, as you would expect. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Excellent. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yeah, hi, thanks. Good morning, guys. I want to talk a little bit about sort of operating leverage as we think forward and sort of along the lines of the last question. It seems like there is an opportunity for both price as well as volume as you move into next year, truck markets beginning to tighten up. You put together good incremental margins in the third quarter. Just want to get a rough sense of maybe how you think about sort of that cadence as we go forward with the productivity initiatives you have and sort of the pricing, if you put it all together and similar, how you think about that over the next several quarters? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Good morning, Chris. Yes, we have seen a nice trend in operating leverage and incremental margin thus far this year. Looking out, the cadence will depend to some extent on the mix of volume growth we experienced. Cindy, maybe you could address that a little bit further. Cindy Cynthia Earhart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yes, sure. Hi, Chris. Yeah. As Jim said, we've seen good incremental margins and I think we expect to see those going forward. Just to remind you, I think we've talked about this before, that we see it's sort of a hierarchy in terms of incremental margins in our business. The highest, of course, is merchandise followed by coal and then intermodal. So, it really will be dependent upon where we see the incremental growth going forward. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. But the setup that we have in terms of what sort of working and sort of a tighter truck market doesn't lead you one way or another when you think about that? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Well, as Alan said, we do see the opportunity from a tightening truck market not only in our intermodal franchise, but in general merchandise as well and there we do have significant incremental margin opportunity. In addition to the extent we're able to price into a tightening truck market, that too should support incremental margin going forward. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And just a quick follow up on head count. I just wanted to make sure I was clear on sort of how you think about the progress in both fourth quarter and then maybe going forward, it sounds like there is some incremental heads may be coming to get advance of some peak business in 2018. But, I just want to make sure I understood the cadence of that? Thank you. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Cindy, why don't you take that one. Cindy Cynthia Earhart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yes. So, Chris, certainly we've seen good head count reductions. Our year-over-year head count is down about 1,100. Well, I did mention in my prepared remarks that we expect head count in the fourth quarter to be flat or slightly up and that's really all dependent on our T&E hiring. We're hiring kind of ahead of our peak demand month in the summer and fall going in 2018. So, that's where you're seeing the increases. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Perfect. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz of UBS. Please proceed with your question. Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah. Good morning and congratulations on the strong results. I wanted to ask you about pipeline on productivity and just how we might think of drivers of margin expansion if you look out into 2018. So, I think, you've had a number of structural cost reductions that you put in place over the last few years and you're putting up nice incremental margins and further productivity gains. How do you think, Jim or Mike about what's in the pipeline going into next year in terms of structural cost takeout or just what would support operating leverage and margin expansion next year? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Good morning, Tom. Productivity certainly has been a key driver of financial improvements this year and last and we expect that to continue. We've made a lot of progress in a couple of key areas already. We ticked off some of the records that we achieved in the third quarter as part of Mike's presentation. And yes, there are many additional productivity opportunities in the pipeline. Mike, why don't you comment on that? Michael J. Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yeah. Okay. So, I would just note that there are some things that are going to run through 2018 that we initiated this year, the reduction or the idling of one of our terminals earlier this year. The 150 locomotives we've taken out of service that was a first half thing that will run through all of next year. And then the division consolidation we told you about before it actually goes into effect next week. So, a lot of those things will run through full year next year. But, we continue to take a look at optimizing the train plan, and as you saw that we had 4% more volume out there. But we reduced crew starts by 2%. So, we handled 4% more volume with 2% less crews. So that's optimizing our train plan and train length. So, we continue to take a look at how we can take costs out of the railroad. It may not necessarily be a big terminal or anything like that, but it's taking costs across the railroad out of the network, but still making sure that we're able to provide the service that our customers are looking for. So, there are a lot of initiatives going on, more to come and we balance out the service, but we're not letting up. Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, that's helpful, maybe just a follow up on that. So, if you look at 2018, what do you think will be the bigger driver of margin expansion, would it be volume growth and that's supporting operating leverage for longer trains and so forth? Or do you think a bigger opportunity is from more of the pure cost or productivity, whether that's facility rationalization, changing the train plan, however, you would frame it? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Tom, ours is a balanced plan, it's balanced, it's dynamic and it's flexible as well and that's why we've been able to consistently deliver strong performance. So our expectation looking into 2018 and beyond is that we will continue to deliver bottom line improvements through a combination of growth and productivity. Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you for the time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks, good morning, everyone. Jim, we saw headlines a couple of weeks ago about the various labor unions coming together to come up with an agreement with the Class 1 rails, which is pending ratification from the rank and file. I was wondering if you had any initial thoughts on how that agreement stacks up versus your expectations. Thanks. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: We have reached a tentative agreement with a coalition of unions representing about 60% of our employees. It is out for ratification and we'll await the results of ratification before commenting further on the agreement. Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And just as a follow up, I'm sorry if I missed it, but did you quantify any impact from the hurricane in the third quarter and also given that you mentioned that your primary competition is truck, how much customer overlap do you really have with your eastern partner in that, if you have customers who are unhappy with their service, they could look to you as a long-term alternative? Thanks. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: We did not quantify any additional expenses as a result of the hurricanes in the third quarter. Alan, why don't you comment on the competitive landscape? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yeah. Our primary form of competition is truck, Ravi. We do share some customers with CSX and as I suggested, we're offering a differentiated service product and a long-term approach of a balance between cost effectiveness and supporting our customers' growth. And so to the extent the customers are looking for dependable service provider, we're there. Our primary focus is on securing business from the highway and we see that spot rates are up 15% in trucking and drive-in over the last couple of months and are up about 25% year-over-year. That's also buttressed by an improving economy in which consumer confidence and the PMI for manufacturing are at effectively 13-year highs. So our focus is on competing with truck. That's been our thesis. That's the opportunity provided to us by operating in the East and that's where we're going to see a lot of growth. Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Jason Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you, operator. Hey, guys. I want to just focus on freight that you might have won from your Eastern competitor due to their service issues in the quarter. It seems like whatever you did take on didn't negatively disrupt your network, and you kept your service levels high. Could you talk a little bit about the thought process of taking on that freight and how likely it is that you're going to retain it? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Sure. I would emphasize that our goal is to grow while pushing hard on productivity as well. So we believe we have an excellent service product in the marketplace that allows us to compete with truck and rail. Alan, talk a little bit about the specifics in terms of market share -rail market share in the quarter? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yeah. Jason, as we've talked before, there is a lot of collaboration within Norfolk Southern about volume opportunities. And our primary focus was on making sure that any volume we brought on was accretive to the bottom line and to our shareholders and did not disrupt the responsibility that we have to our existing customer base to provide a consistent and predictable service product. And so that's how we went into this. We could be judicious with the unit trains that we added, and we look for opportunities to add trains into our scheduled merchandise network and within intermodal. We also make sure that anything we brought on in the short-term did not necessarily reduce our ability to handle additional business at higher returns in the long-term. Jason Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. That's some good color. And I guess my next question is going to be on the incentive comp. Obviously, it was a little bit higher than I expected. It was actually higher than you saw an increase last year in the third quarter. What should we look for incentive comp in 4Q? Cindy Cynthia Earhart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Hi, Jason. This is Cindy. Jason Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hey, Cindy. Cindy Cynthia Earhart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yeah, you did notice, we talked about in the prepared remarks that incentive comp was up $47 million year-over-year. And maybe just a little bit of context. If you think back to 2015, we had a zero bonus, then going into 2016 we did have a bonus but it was a lower leveled bonus. And then this year really based on improving business results, you've seen the incentive comp go up. So when we think about fourth quarter, the expectation was you would see a similar year-over-year increase in incentive comp in the fourth quarter. Jason Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. That's perfect. Those are my two. I appreciate the time as always, everyone. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Congrats on the good results. I wanted to ask if you could just offer some thoughts on growth. I guess relative to the underlying market, there's obviously some idiosyncratic things happening, whether it's market share opportunities, truckload capacity tightening, pricing. So against that backdrop, just wanted to try to get a sense of your thinking about your volume growth, revenue growth actually potential relative to the actual underlying markets that you're serving? Thanks so much. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Balance is really the key. We are aiming to grow, but while achieving ever-improving productivity as well. So, Alan, why don't you talk a little bit about the major verticals and our growth expectations there as outlined in our current long-range plan? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Sure. Amit, we're pretty excited about the environment in which we're operating right now. We see truck capacity tightening significantly, buttressed by an improving economy, which should certainly assist our intermodal markets. It will also assist many of our merchandise markets, as we implement \u2013 we continue to implement our plan of a strong service foundation, schedules that meet our customers' needs, an equipment strategy that supports growth, technology improvements that optimize the distribution of the equipment and make it easier to do business with us. All of that is part of our strategic plan. It's all designed to compete with truck. And so those are positives for us. As I look into the fourth quarter, I'll draw your attention to export, we're still projecting 5 million tons to 6 million tons of export coal. Recognize last year the fourth quarter was our highest export coal quarter. I think through three quarters, we did about \u2013 last year we did about 10 million tons of coal, export in the fourth quarter we did 4.6 million tons. So the comps get a little bit more difficult. We also had a much milder summer in the East and the start to the fall has been mild. And so I think we're going to be somewhat limited in our utility volume in the fourth quarter. Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And just one follow-up for me, if I could. And it's really a question about CapEx and cash deployment. The CapEx requirements of the business and really the industry, I guess, are kind of staying where they are today, or if not, going maybe a bit lower over the foreseeable future. Some companies, some of your peers in the U.S. at least have committed to maybe more ambitious share repurchase activity. I wonder if you could talk about that. You've chosen to pay down some debt. I just wanted to see if maybe we should expect a little bit more of a pivot on the cash deployment side towards more of what some of your peers are doing? Thanks. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: In terms of capital allocation generally, our approach is very disciplined. We are putting the money back into the business that we need to, to reinvest in the business, to keep our service strong. In terms of shareholder distributions, we're targeting a one-third payout ratio with incremental free cash flow going toward share buybacks. Cindy, talk about the change that we made in the buyback program recently and our expectations for shareholder distributions for the whole year. Cindy Cynthia Earhart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yes. So we did announce the board approved $50 million (sic) [50 million] more in share repurchases through 2022. In terms of the share repurchases, we also increased that this year. We started our guiding at about$800 million repurchases and we're at $1 billion. And so going forward, and as Jim said, we have a very disciplined approach to cash deployment. We'll invest back in the business. Our plans are to distribute back to shareholders via dividends and over the long-term get to about a 33% dividend payout ratio, and then we use remaining cash to have share repurchases. So that's our strategy going forward, and I think that's been our approach all along. Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, all right. That's very clear, guys. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt Troy with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your questions. Matthew Troy - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yeah, good morning. Just wanted to get a split. You talked about 4% volume growth in intermodal. I was wondering if you could provide some detail as to what the growth rates were in domestic versus international. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yeah. Matt, international was down slightly. Of course, we and the ports that we served were impacted by the hurricanes. And so that was somewhat of a drag, and then domestic was up about 7%, 7.5%. Matthew Troy - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And is it fair to think, given all the talk and anticipation about capacity issues in trucking and a better pricing environment potentially emerging next year, is the biggest bite of the apple one way you should think about the cadence of pricing improvement in intermodal, is it still \u2013 should we still be kind of bogeying the second quarter is where you really get that biggest bite or is it more spread out now? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Well, that is certainly when bid season typically occurs for our customers. We've already negotiated 85% of the revenue for this year. We've already negotiated about 54% of the revenue for next year. So it does, Matt, as you noted, it is tied to the bid season for our customers, and it's also tied to the contract renewals that we have. Matthew Troy - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And my one quick follow-up would be, I know you don't guide to core pricing, but it sounds like it's going to be a better year next year. Can you just give us your expectations for rail inflation in 2018? Thank you. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Right now, all-inclusive less fuel is at 1.9% for next year. Matthew Troy - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking my question. And congrats to Jim and team. It's not lost on us that your OR is beating the competition here. But, Jim, I want to ask on those lines. I mean, we've seen a lot of volatility in your company's earnings in the past, especially with swings in export coal. Obviously that market can shut off and turn on very quickly. But it sounds like you're planning for a higher labor cost outlook, higher head count next year, if I'm not mistaken by the comments you've made. So how could you mitigate the risk that maybe that market turns off quickly? What can be done on the cost structure that would keep the OR trajectory heading lower? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: The plan is dynamic and flexible, and that's really been the hallmark of our execution over the last couple of years. As you've seen, the business ebb and flow. We have been able to make adjustments and to react to changes in the marketplace. And that's what we'll continue to do. We will continue to drive hard on productivity and growth, wherever growth is available. If market conditions change, we will again adapt and be flexible. Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And I hate to nitpick on the call but, Cindy, it looks like your other cost line came in at about $40 million. And if I go back the last few quarters, you've been running, let's call it, somewhere between $75 million and $80 million. I know that you've called out $9 million in the landfill gains, but was there something else that favorably impacted the quarter? Or is that the new run rate that we should be looking at going forward? Cindy Cynthia Earhart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yeah. Brandon, as you said, I did call out $9 million increase year-over-year in the gain on sale of operating properties. And, obviously, those things change from quarter-to-quarter. It's hard to predict when you're going to have gains. In terms of the large number of gains from year-over-year, in the third quarter, I think we talked about \u2013 third quarter of 2016 I think we talked about around $28 million worth of large gains. In this quarter in 2017, we had about $38 million worth of large gains. So that has some impact and that's probably the biggest thing. And, again, it's hard to predict from quarter-to-quarter. Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. That's actually very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Good morning. Jim, I guess, third quarter is typically your best operating ratio and looking at the cost strides you've made, do you need to overhaul ops like counter-suggest to get down to the 60% range? Or can you keep doing the blocking and tackling as you've been doing to get to this point to get that progress? And maybe talk about the \u2013 is that a realistic progress for your network to get to over a longer term? I know 65%is your near-term one. And then just your thoughts on the $100 million productivity. You mentioned you beat the target. I guess, maybe thoughts on the potential of scale as you move forward this year. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Sure. Good morning, Ken. So let me begin by emphasizing that we've been making significant progress on our long-term objectives, and achieving and exceeding our goals. So you saw in the third quarter, the seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating ratio improvement, and that gives us confidence that we're going to be \u2013 we'll continue to drive the operating ratio and the bottom line and that we'll get to that sub-65%OR by 2020 or sooner. In terms of productivity, we've said that we expect at least $100 million this year. Right now we think that'll probably be closer to $150 million for the full year. Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. And is there \u2013 have you set a scale for next year yet or is that still just part of this $650 million total? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Well, I can tell you this. We have the pedal to the metal. We are pushing as hard as we possibly can on all aspects of our strategic plan. And we certainly expect to achieve significant additional productivity savings next year and beyond. Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And then just a quick one, I guess, Cindy. Long-term debt went up, rates are climbing, but interest expense went down sequentially. Was there anything in that number that altered that interest expense savings? Cindy Cynthia Earhart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Ken, I would say that there was not really anything that would impact that. We did do a payoff of higher-rated debt in the quarter, so that did impact it. Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : But yet your long-term debt went up sequentially. I guess, I could talk to you offline. It just seems like your long-term debt went up sequentially. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Well, you're seeing older debt at a higher rate roll off... Cindy Cynthia Earhart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Right. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: ... and be replaced by new debt at a lower coupon, but ... Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah. Cindy Cynthia Earhart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yeah. As part of the exchange, Ken, we exchanged about $550 million into $750 million worth of debt. Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thanks for clarifying. Appreciate it. Thanks for the time. Thanks for the insight. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your questions. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey. Thanks. Morning, everyone. So wanted to just kind of revisit the head count and just more broadly the productivity discussion. So obviously nice spread between volume growth and head count this quarter, but we are seeing service issues when we just look at train speeds lower year-over-year. Do you think \u2013 are we kind of at the point where we can't cut head count and can't cut locomotives anymore, and it's more just about leverage from volume, or is that not the message? And then if we are sort of at that point where we're seeing some service issues, do you focus more on price than volume next year? I know you're going to say you're going to focus on both, but if you had to kind of prioritize price versus volume next year, how would you answer that? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Okay. Let's talk about service before, and I'll comment generally and then Cindy can go back over our expectations for head count this year. And then, Mike, maybe you can weigh in on kind of the resource balance. With respect to service generally, we are steadfast in our commitment to deliver quality service that our customers value. That's key to the value proposition. For the third quarter as a whole, we saw network performance rebound back to first quarter levels and roughly target composite service metric levels. And in that context, we were able to grow volume and the top line, while providing a high-level service product to our customers. So that's the paradigm. That's what we will be looking to do going forward. Now, Mike, why don't you start and talk a little bit about the resource balance, and then Cindy will come back in and talk about where we expect head count to go? Michael J. Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yeah. So it's not like we don't have opportunities out there as we continue to look at the network and see what business grows on the network, where we can optimize the cost. We still have resources available to us from the locomotives. We have about almost 400 units stored and available that'll help us handle growth, but it doesn't mean we're not looking at finding ways to reduce the cost structure of the railroad long-term. A lot of initiatives going on. We've already talked about the ones we've done this year that are rolled through. We're not giving up on any of that. But I'll say that we also make sure that we've got to have a good service product. And Jim noted, it did improve sequentially over the quarter and you noted some increases in dwell and train speed. I would just point out that at the end of the third quarter, we had several hurricanes that hit our partners on the West and as well as two of them that impacted us. And we held some traffic in our terminals for that until our customers got back up to speed, or our partners got back up to speed. But really no damage to our railroad and we rebounded quickly. So that's kind of what you're seeing. So we feel comfortable about where we're going on further cost reductions but still making sure that we are taking care of the service. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Now with regard to head count specifically, Cindy did state that we expect head count to be flat to up slightly at the end of this year versus today. But there's a specific reason for that. So, Cindy, go over the training cycle and the onboarding process. Cindy Cynthia Earhart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Sure. As I said, the flat to slightly up was really completely dependent upon hiring ahead of what we see peak demand season for crews in the summer and the fall of 2018. As you know, the cycle to hire and train and have those folks available takes several months to get that done. So that's really what's driving the head count. As I said before, 1,100 folks down quarter-over-quarter, that's really across the company in all areas. And productivity is extremely important to us, and we're going to be pushing on that, again, in all areas. And we look very closely at T&E, and you'll note that I think our volumes were up year-to-date about 5%, and we've really held the T&E head count pretty flat throughout the year. So it's something that we look very, very closely at. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yeah. And that bump up is in the neighborhood of maybe 200 more employees for the next ... Cindy Cynthia Earhart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Right. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: ... quarter or so until we get them ready to go out there. So it's slightly up and it's by design. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : So that's helpful. I don't know, Alan, if you addressed kind of that price versus volume prioritization point. And then just to clarify on the head count, I think earlier in the year, you said, hey, we may need to add some T&E, but there's still non-T&E that we can reduce. Are we running out of that non-T&E to reduce? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Bob, I'll take that one. Look, the focus is on all areas of head count, as Cindy said. We are looking at all aspects of employment and staffing and looking for reductions and have achieved reductions across the board. Now with regard to your price-versus-volume question, it really isn't a question of price versus volume. It is both, and we are looking to achieve both volume growth and price increases commensurate with the service product we have out in the marketplace. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And then, if I can just ask one more, Alan. So you talked about some of the weather issues in coal. Any way to give a preliminary view on export and then domestic coal for next year? Meaning, do you think the run rates that you talked about for fourth quarter are sustainable into '18, or do we need to reset those lower for '18? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: For export coal, what we're hearing, Scott, is that that market has legs through \u2013 potentially through the first half of next year. A lot of the run up in price has been event driven, which isn't necessarily good, but I think it also supports the theory that the market out there for export coal is fairly tight. Although I can paint the other picture. As you're aware, API 2is backwardated right now. So that suggests it's going down. But the best I can do, Scott, is kind of tell you what we're hearing, which I just did, and then point you towards the economic metrics that we're looking at or indicators that we're looking at. With respect to utility coal, that's going to be highly dependent upon the weather. Natural gas prices are pretty similar to where they are \u2013 were at this time last year. Stockpiles are down slightly versus last year. I think they're down about where they were at like 79 days, they're off about 22 days from the high, which was May 2016. And really what happens in the first quarter and second quarter next year is going to be dependent upon weather patterns in the East in the winter. Does it make sense? Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Yeah, now it does. Thank you, guys. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.: Thanks and good morning. Alan, I think you mentioned a little over half of your revenue for 2018 is negotiated at this point. Given that visibility, could you just talk high level about how the price increases for that business compared to the last pricing up-cycle that we saw? I'm just curious if you could provide some perspective on how the pricing environment next year could compare to the acceleration we saw in 2014 and '15? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Sure. So, Justin, the \u2013 as I think I noted, the contracts that we renegotiated in the third quarter generally had a higher level of increase than what we were able to secure in the second quarter. So that's a positive for us. I'll note that one of the things that really supported year-over-year rate increases this year within coal was the export market, and we certainly don't expect that level of run up next year. As trucking firms, we've got a lot of business that's transactional, and that is going to offer support for pricing. Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. But if you look at those non-coal businesses and where pricing is coming in for next year, I mean is that roughly in line with what you saw when things picked up in 2014 and 2015? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: You know there was a lag there too because the uptick was relatively sharp, certainly a lot sharper than folks had anticipated generally in March 2014. We might be a little bit ahead of it this year in terms of the outlook because the commentary about the tightening truck market has been out there for a bit, particularly associated around ELD. So we're certainly factoring that into our conversations with our customers and our bid approach, and frankly our customers are having those same kind of conversations with their customers. Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.: Okay, and maybe as a quick follow-up. On the last call you talked about roughly 50% to 60% of your revenue that's typically renegotiated each year. When you look at what's left, or I guess that other call it 50% or so or a little under 50% for next year, is there any color you can provide on the commodity breakdown of this revenue that's still left for renewal? I'm just curious if it's more weighted towards the specific business or commodity group? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Well, we've moved more towards shorter-term pricing in export so that has to be renegotiated. But once again that's less than 3% of our overall volume. With intermodal, there are defined escalators, but there's also transactional business and that has offered support for us. I note that even this quarter we had RPU growth in all seven of our major groups. Same thing we had in second quarter. Second quarter, I would say, truck capacity was loose; third quarter truck capacity tightened and we were able to continue that March. Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.: Okay, great. I'll leave it at that. Thanks for the time. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions. Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, good morning. So, Alan, just wanted to see if you've thought through some of the contingencies that might need to be put in place if there was trade disruption with Mexico given all the rhetoric and headlines of NAFTA, so if you could give us a sense of how much volume and revenues for Norfolk are really tied to cross-border trade? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Good morning, Brian. Let me say that we are certainly pro-trade as a company and an industry, and in favor of trade regimes that promote cross-border flows. Alan, comment specifically on scenarios for us. Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Hey, Brian, it is a \u2013 it's a very small component of our revenue. We have every intention of growing that and we're working on opportunities to put together products that would improve that. But, it's something that we're monitoring very closely where there have been four negotiations so far and there are three more that are scheduled. Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Right. And to clarify small meaning like less than 5%, is there a threshold you would consider putting that below? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yes. Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then one for Mike. You talked a lot about train lengths increasing. And then you have obviously had a great run with that. At this point, there \u2013 and you talked about balancing it with service. Is there any point in the East specifically, where you have to worry about longer trains potentially blocking some grade crossings or interfering with some commuter traffic or other traffic patterns, you might cause some congestion in local communities because we are starting to hear a little bit of concern from the regulators just in the East region in general on that aspect in particular? Michael J. Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yeah. So on the train length, we go to great effort to make sure train lengths don't impact grade crossings. I mean, we try to keep our grade crossings clear and make a big effort at that. So train length isn't really that much of an issue for us in that. It can be making sure that certain single-track territories have enough capacity but that is really a small area for us. So, overall, train length continues to grow. And I'll just note this so far into the fourth quarter continues to look good. So, we're very selective about what we do. We've got a lot of planning that goes into it. So to make sure that we don't create the problems that you're talking about, because we're very, very mindful of those. Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Well, thanks for the details. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question. Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Thanks for taking my questions here. So, I wanted to follow-up on a couple of earlier questions on what the tightening trucking market really means for Norfolk next year. And specifically, do your contractual obligations to your key domestic intermodal partners in the intermodal business there in the \"defined escalators\" that you mentioned in response to Justin's question, give you the flexibility to push harder on intermodal pricing next year? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Bascome, I think, the key is the opportunity for both us and our channel partners in a tightening truck environment. We have \u2013 we have strong relationships with channel partners throughout the intermodal business and we expect to grow along with them. So, we see it as a win-win for NS and its channel partners. Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : I mean, are you suggesting that it's really more about for you volume than pricing next year, just given some of the constraints in your contracts or is there an opportunity to dip more aggressively in both? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: We see it as an opportunity to grow both volume and rate next year. Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Thank you. And I just want to clarify one other comment that you made. You're talking about adding employees to get ahead of the peak \u2013 peak T&E training period in the spring and summer. Are there any furloughed employees that could potentially be brought back at a lower cost and lead time compared to kind of the six month to nine month training of brand new employees that you talked about in the past when head count is getting a little tighter? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: No, we pretty much got all the furloughs back, just maybe a handful less double-digit \u2013 low double digits at best. So, no, we don't \u2013 we don't have that out there, but we stay in close coordination with marketing as to what they see. And you talked about the six months to nine months, we spend a lot of time reducing that timeframe down also. So we do two things. One, we feel like we can bring them back and get them \u2013 or bring them on board and get them qualified quicker. And we're pretty surgical about when we hire them so that they're available when we need them. So those are the two things that make us feel good about having the right T&E crew base ahead of when we need them. Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Thank you for your time. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Suneel Manhas - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: Good morning. This is Suneel Manhas on for Walter Spracklin. Just wanted to circle back real quickly to CapEx, how should we be thinking of your CapEx here given the volume growth, specifically like at what point could there be requirement for incremental CapEx to support the growth? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Well, we're working on our capital plan for 2018, even as we speak. We'll have more to say about that early next year. But I will say this, ours is a very disciplined approach to capital spending. We're looking to maximize returns on capital from our capital spending plan going forward. And that will include the usual categories of capital spending, both maintenance spending and growth spending. Suneel Manhas - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: And just a quick follow-up, on the savings and the expectation initiatives you noted, are there certain regions of your network or lanes where you see the most opportunity? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: I'm sorry. I didn't understand the first part of the question. Could you repeat that? Suneel Manhas - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: So yeah, sorry. So on the productivity savings you're expecting for Q4 and you mentioned expectations for further savings into 2018. Are there certain regions of your network or lanes where you see the most opportunity? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Productivity really is a network-wide opportunity. So we see opportunities to drive productivity throughout our network. Suneel Manhas - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: Okay. Got it. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please proceed with your question. Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities, Inc.: Thanks very much and good morning. I also wanted to dig in on the record train length a little bit. Can you talk about where you're making those gains and what I'm driving at there is \u2013 I assume that your coal network is close to optimal. So I'm curious if you're seeing improvement in merchandise or intermodal or both? Michael J. Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yeah, the answer is both. Intermodal has been the biggest driver, but merchandise as well, and you're right, the coal unit trains have been optimized for a while. I will tell you on some of the other unit trains, stone and agriculture, we have increased those in coordination with our customers. So Intermodal is the big driver but merchandise is also growing as well. Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities, Inc.: And just by way of a quick follow-up, you've been seeing some puts and takes in terms of the merchandise volumes, is that creating any challenges in terms of making improvements in the merchandise network? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Well, Alan, why don't you go back over the merchandise growth trend in the quarter and let's use that as the foundation for addressing her question about train sizes and operations and the merchandise network generally? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yeah, Cherilyn. We started to see some fairly robust growth sequentially as we moved through the third quarter effectively up until the hurricane started to impact our customer base and so it took a pause and September has started to rebound in the fourth quarter and we're seeing strength in steel, we're seeing strength in frac sand, seeing a little bit of crude oil although that will be a year-over-year decline, but it's picking up sequentially. Automotive will post better comps in the fourth quarter year-over-year than it did in the third quarter as U.S. vehicle production declines are year-over-year less. And Ag has kind of got off to a slow start in the quarter due to delayed harvest although within the last seven days we started to see that volume pick up as well. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: So much of the growth that Alan just went through in the merchandise arena has occurred within our scheduled train network and that's one reason why you're seeing the incrementals you're seeing. We're also seeing some growth in unit trains as well. Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities, Inc.: Thank you. That's some helpful color, particularly on the volume side. That's all from me. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. Ben J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hey. My quick question for you on the topics of dwell and train velocity addressed earlier. Is it fair to assume that you're expecting improvements in both of those measures in 2018? Obviously the hurricane disruptions aside just as volume growth decelerates from peak 2Q levels, one? And then two, if so, what is kind of a longer term target for both of those metrics? Can we view the 2012, 2013 levels as high watermarks and do you have visibility to returning to or perhaps exceeding those in both dwell and velocity? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yeah. I think, those are both numbers that we feel very comfortable about not only achieving, but also very comfortable about \u2013 gave us a really good service product that allowed our customers to grow on a railroad. So, yeah, we do expect those to improve into 2018. Absolutely. Ben J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your questions. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning, guys. And thanks for taking the question. Alan, I want to ask you a little bit about the pricing opportunity in intermodal. If you go back the last 10-years, 15-years, the intermodal RPU for Norfolk hasn't really budged that much despite a 3% inflation in highway cost and a higher oil price and all that. Is there something about the market dynamic or the density you have in your network that's giving you a little bit better leverage to pricing in intermodal over the next 5-years to 10-years. Just wondering how those negotiations are going with shippers and what's giving you a chance to maybe take a little bit more price up relative to truck than you have in the past? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Well, David, what's occurred is that, we're starting to see a much tighter truck environment and we've got some market approach that our customers value. We've got a service product with schedules that meet their needs. And, so, our conversation with them is how do we grow together. And we firmly believe that negotiated rate increases reflect the value of your service product, and we're leaning in the price. We're not putting new dots on the map. We've got our capacity. We'll continue to invest in the big areas like Chicago and Atlanta, but our focus is on utilizing the existing capacity that we have to \u2013 and leaning in the price to drive shareholder return. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Are you passing up on a little bit more of the business that might be out there right now relative to maybe you were 5 years, 10 years ago? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Five years, 10 years ago, we implemented some Corridor strategies which have been very beneficial to us. For instance, the Heartland Corridor, we put in the \u2013 handled business between the Ohio Valley and Chicago, and Norfolk. And as volume moves to the East Coast ports, that's something that's going to support our growth. And we've got the capacity in place. Now it's our opportunity to leverage it. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: David, one thing to bear in mind, as you look at the trend in our intermodal RPU over, say, the last five years is the effect of the Triple Crown downsizing. Our Triple Crown business had a significantly higher RPU than the average intermodal RPU. And when we, for all intents and purposes, shut down that business, it did have a dampening effect on reported RPU, albeit it was the best thing for the bottom line. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: All right. I appreciate that color. And then maybe, Cindy, just as a quick follow-up. Can you give us a range for what we should be expecting on property sales on a kind of annual rolling basis here and kind of whether or how the property sales impact management incentives on EBIT and OR? Cindy Cynthia Earhart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yeah. David, it's really hard to tell you how property sales are going to come in from quarter-to-quarter, as I said before. I mean, they're obviously going to and it \u2013 operating sales will have an impact on our OR, which does impact our incentive plans. I will tell you though that when you look at our operating property sales in the third quarter, they were \u2013 our improvement in OR year-over-year was not dependent upon those property sales. And we expect fourth quarter that will also have year-over-year operating ratio improvements and they will not be dependent upon those sales. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: But is Norwalk maybe using property sales as a little bit more of a lever here for OR just given that the incentives in place and should we be expecting more relative to trend or is it just going to come up how it comes up? Cindy Cynthia Earhart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yeah. I mean, I think that obviously we will always look at property that we have that's no longer used in the business and we'll try to get rid of it. And as I said, it's very difficult to predict. Getting rid of that property is part of our strategy, but at the end of the day, it's really not going to be a big driver of our OR. The things that we talk about, service, productivity and growth, are going to be the things that drive our OR. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: All right. Thanks a lot for the time, guys. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Please proceed with your questions. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey. Good morning. Hey, Alan. It seems like the prospects for domestic intermodal look really strong. I think the volumes are at record levels. But I was wondering if you could talk about IMC box availability. And second, do you and your pool partners have any plans to add to the E&P fleet to maybe support growth or do you feel like there's enough capacity there? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Tyler, capacity is tight with boxes, which is good for pricing opportunities, particularly on the transactional level. As Jim noted, we're currently in the process of developing our capital plan for 2018. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then, Jim, this is more of a strategic question and I can't remember where I saw you speak. I think it was one of the Rail Shipper conferences. But I recall your presentation was really revolving around NS's strategy about revamping how you face the customer. So I was just curious, if you or Alan could just talk about where you are in that program, maybe what kind of initiatives, maybe technologies that we and customers would expect? And then what do you hopefully hope to yield from these investments? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Well, I'll quickly turn it over to Cindy to go through some of these specific technology investments that we are making. But first, I do want to reiterate the importance to our strategy of customer engagement and customer interface. We are working hard to get closer and stay closer to our customers. And one of the main ways we're doing that is through investments we're making in technology. Cindy Cynthia Earhart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yeah. So, let me just add a little bit of color to that. As Jim said, we are investing quite a bit in the way that we interact with customers. And I would characterize it maybe in three different areas. The first is \u2013 our \u2013 how we face the customer. We have a big project to upgrade our portal and basically change not just the look and feel of it, but really everything behind it; the data, the data accuracy, the timeliness. We want to make it very easy for customers to be able to get the information that they need when they need it. We are, secondly, working on what we call customer relationship management, which is really technology within this company, so that no matter where you are in the company, marketing, accounting, transportation, customer service, we all have one view of the customer. We all have the most relevant data and we can interact with the customer having that type of information and managing issues. And then I think the third part is we are looking very closely at the technology that we have implemented within our customer service center and looking to upgrade that, so we can better serve our customers. So, a lot of effort around that multiyear project, but we think will be very beneficial for both us and our customers. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: And, Tyler, it's... Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: It's an ongoing process, as Cindy said. We're implementing some things now, some things we're investing ahead of the curve in some areas and some things we'll be rolling out next year. The foundation of it is a predictable service product. What differentiates us is our equipment strategy for growth homogenizing the fleet that offers for better asset turns, that offers better equipment reliability, the ability to provide equipment in safe working order to our customers on time, better transparency for our customers, it's a customer engagement focused on proactive notification and a seamless interface with the customer. It's collaboration with our short line partners and economic development partners to extend our network reach, it's innovative service products that utilize and generate a return on our existing assets. All those things are part of our strategy to differentiate ourselves and help us compete with truck. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: And let me just close this subject by pointing out that all of these different initiatives we've described are coming to fruition now and will continue to do so in the future. This has been a major emphasis and focus of our team since I became CEO. And, Alan, Mike, Cindy and I have all spent a lot of time with our customers gathering their input, their ideas for improvement and how we can refine and improve our service product and that's where those ideas came from and that's why we are driving so hard to implement them. Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. Perfect. Now \u2013 sounds extremely interesting. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I would turn the floor back to Mr. Jim Squires for closing comment. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Thank you. Thank you all for your questions. I'd also like to take this opportunity to thank all of our employees for their contributions to a record breaking quarter. Our balanced and successful approach focused on increasing efficiency and delivering a strong customer service product gives us confidence in our ability to achieve our goals and deliver sustainable value. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Clay Moore, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Moore, you may begin. Clay Moore : Thank you, Rob, and good morning. Before we begin, please note that during today's call, we may make certain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, and may differ materially from actual results. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. The slides of the presenters are available on our website at norfolksouthern.com in the Investors section along with our non-GAAP reconciliations. Additionally, a transcript and downloads will be posted after the call. Now it's my pleasure to introduce the Norfolk Southern's Chairman, President and CEO, Jim Squires. James Squires : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Norfolk Southern's fourth quarter 2017 earnings call. Joining me on today's call are Alan Shaw, Chief Marketing Officer; Mike Wheeler, Chief Operating Officer; and Cynthia Earhart, Chief Financial Officer. Slide 4 shows the fourth quarter and full year highlights excluding the impacts of tax reform and I'm pleased to say that we continue to achieve record results through the successful execution of our strategic plan. Net income for the fourth quarter was a $486 million, up 17% from the prior year and earnings per share increased 19% to $1.69. We were able to lower our fourth quarter operating ratio by 170 basis points to 66.7. For the full year net income increased 15% to $1.9 billion and earnings per share increased 18% to $661 billion. We achieved a record 67.4 operating ratio, which was 150 basis point improvements over 2016, demonstrating our focus on productivity, cost control and growth as we move forward under our strategic plan. Each of these achievements is a testament to the hard work and dedication of our employees, whose determination has powered our successes of the past several years and who I'm confident will make Norfolk Southern even stronger in 2018. Moving to Slide 5. We remain committed to investing in our business as capital expenditures totaled over $1.7 billion in 2017, representing investment in our rail infrastructure and projects that grow our business, like the recently completed Portageville Bridge that will support economic vitality and jobs across New York's Southern Tier region. We also realized new business in 2017 from 75 industries, we had assisted in locating or expanding along our lines, representing over $1 billion invested by our customers. Our portfolio of active industrial development projects is as a strong as it's been since the Great Recession reflecting optimism in the economy and in doing business with Norfolk Southern for the long-term. That optimism is mirrored in our continued commitment to a balanced capital allocation strategy, that invest in our network's health and growth opportunities for our business, maintains a solid dividend targeting a 1/3rd payout ratio over the long-term and returns capital to our shareholders through ongoing share repurchases. Our board has underscored this commitment by authorizing a $1.8 billion capital budget in 2018, an 18% increase in the dividend or $0.72 per share and the continuation of our share repurchase program. Slide 6 illustrates our unrelenting focus on productivity gains, which have enhanced resource utilization while accommodating growth. The results can be seen throughout all areas in our organization. In terms of labor productivity, our full year volumes increased by 5%, yet we were able to lower our average headcount by 3% versus last year's levels. 2017 was also a record for fuel efficiency as fuel consumption was lower than the prior year despite the increase in traffic. These measures highlight our ability to deliver results through cost saving efforts, efficiencies and asset utilization. In total, we generated $150 million in productivity savings in 2017, on top of $250 million in 2016. Moving to service. Our annual composite service metric declined compared to 2016. Our service levels last year were lower than we would have liked. As we recover from challenging operating conditions, we are focused on improving network stability and resilience, while continuing to drive productivity. We are fully committed to delivering on our long-term targets through a combination of growth and efficiency, and I'll update you on these targets after Alan, Mike and Cindy provide further details on our fourth quarter results and outlook as we head into 2018. I'll now turn the program over to Alan. Alan Shaw : Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Beginning on Slide 8. 2017 finished strong with tightening truck capacity in increased export coal. Total revenue for the quarter improved 7% versus the same period in 2016, driven by volume gains and pricing improvement. Merchandise revenue of $1.6 billion was up 5% as compared to last year, with the ISM Purchasing Managers Index near a 14-year high, strength and industrial production drove volume gains in both the steel and plastics, while increased drilling activity benefited our frac sand market. Export of soybeans decline primarily due to the difficult comps related to the 2016 South American crop. Merchandise revenue per unit was up, reflecting pricing gains and higher fuel surcharge revenue. Intermodal had record volumes for the third consecutive quarter and we delivered record intermodal revenue in the fourth quarter, due to our market focus, tighten truck capacity and high demand for consumer goods. Higher fuel surcharges, positive mix and improved pricing increased RPU 8%. Our coal business benefited from high seaborne prices, supporting export demand, which offset volume declines in the utility markets, resulting from low natural gas prices and mild temperatures. Revenue per unit decreased 1% as declines in our longer haul southern utility franchise negatively impacted mix. Our fourth quarter results continue to demonstrate our market approach as winning business and delivering shareholder value. As we turn to our full year results on Slide 9, the trends we experienced in the fourth quarter are reflective of our 2017 annual results. We achieve total revenues of $10.6 billion, representing a 7% increase. This growth was driven by a 5% increase in volume and a 2% increase in revenue per unit. Merchandise volume for the year was flat compared to 2016, and per steel production and drilling activity drove a 6% increase in metals and construction shipments, while declines in U.S. light vehicle production and pipeline activity negatively impacted our automotive and chemicals businesses, respectively. Revenue per unit less fuel improved 1% as positive pricing was partially offset by an unfavorable - changes in traffic mix. Growth in e-commerce and tightening capacity in the trucking industry led to a 5% increase in intermodal shipments. Export coal volume rose 81% versus 2016 due to increased overseas demand for U.S. coals. As markets evolve, we have capitalized unfavorable conditions and delivered improved bottom line results, due to our inherence to our strategic plan. Since the introduction of our strategic plan two years ago, we have consistently articulated the benefit of our superior customer touch, the continuity of our team in our approach, working with our customers, developing innovative service solutions and delivering value to the marketplace. Our 2017 results demonstrate the merits of this approach. Moving to Slide 10. The strength of our fourth quarter has heightened our outlook for 2018, a prospective share buy of our customers and top economists, who continued to upwardly revise their expectations for this year. For the full year, we expect opportunities for growth in our intermodal and merchandise markets, while coal is expected to decline. In merchandise, strength in industrial production and construction activity provide support for increased business primarily in aggregates, coil, steel and plastics. In our energy markets, higher oil prices and drilling activity will drive greater volumes in crude oil and frac sands. Natural gas liquids are expected to decline in the second half of 2018 as the Mariner East 2 pipeline becomes fully operational. We expect automotive volume to slightly trail U.S. vehicle production with slower manufacturing at specific NS-served plants. Our intermodal business will likely be positively impacted by capacity constraints in the trucking industry, as the ELD mandate is fully implemented, along with increasing consumer demand and continued shifts to e-commerce. The export coal market is anticipated to be strong, although lower than year ago levels as we expect first quarter volumes to be in the 5 million to 6 ton range with an opportunity to push the higher end of that boundary. Benchmark pricing is backward dated, given some uncertainty to the length of these elevated volumes. In the utility market, impacts from the mild temperatures last summer and low natural gas prices are expected to produce volumes in the 15 million to 17 million-ton range in the first quarter. Turning to the overall pricing environment, we remain focused on price and with continued strength in truck rates, we expect higher pricing in our truck competitive business. Pricing will be challenged in our export coal market, as benchmark prices are expected to decline. The extent of our pricing gains in 2018 will be limited by our contract structure, with approximately 45% of our business remaining to be renegotiated this year. Revenue per unit will also benefit from an expected increase in on-highway diesel and WTI prices that will raise our fuel surcharge revenue. We now have approximately 65% of our revenue tied to an on-highway diesel base fuel surcharge program. We continue our initiatives to enhance our value proposition through collaboration with our customers and industry partners. We are developing more customer tools to give them the greater ability to manage their business with us and improve the efficiency and transparency of their supply chain. We are confident that our 2018 plan in the marketplace is highly achievable. Our approach balances productivity and cost control will service providing the foundation to lean and to growth opportunities. As we have demonstrated at Norfolk Southern, we are analytical and deliberative in how and where we invest. We will not allow businesses that yield shareholder value to pass us bye. We will stay close to our customers, hear what they're saying and proactively manage market opportunities. We look forward to a prosperous 2018. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike for an update on operations. Michael Joseph Wheeler : Thank you, Alan, and good morning. Our operational leverage generated in 2017 allowed us to grow our business by providing a competitive service product to our customers, while simultaneously driving productivity initiatives. As shown on Slide 12, we achieved significant milestones in 2017. Our reduction in train accidents, combined with our improvement in key productivity initiatives helped to drive our record operating ratio. Turning to the key drivers of our success on Slide 13. The safety of our employees and the communities we serve continues to be our top priority. Our reportable and serious injury ratios are stable, although, we are not satisfied without continuous improvement in this area. We achieved our lowest train accident frequency on record meeting last year's record low. For service, we experienced a macro challenges in the fourth quarter that began with the last 3 hurricanes in October and ended with a historic snow storm in North Georgia, which shut down one of our most critical routes for 2 days as over 350 trees were removed. We work through these challenges as we handle record volumes by temporarily deploying our service fleet of locomotives. With respect to our overall service product, we are still working toward where we need to be for our customers. We fully recognize the expectations of our customers for a quality, consistent and competitive service product. As Jim has mentioned, network stability and resiliency are our objectives. Moving to some of our key productivity initiatives on Slide 14, we are continuing to drive improvement in all areas. Our rationalization of our locomotive fleet resulted in a record locomotive productivity for the year, beating the prior year's record. These locomotives flow into our search fleet, which has the added benefit of improving that fleet's reliability. Not only do these improvements result in lower maintenance cost, they also enhance our fuel efficiency, which was an annual record as well, again beating the prior year's record. These measures have been driven by optimizing our train plan and our improvements in train length, which resulted in a quarterly record and for the full year. But we must balance these initiatives with the good service. In closing, we are confident we will continue to provide a competitive service product to our customers that will grow our business, while at the same time driving sustainable productivity savings and superior returns for shareholders. We are proud of our accomplishments and continue to identify opportunities to drive additional efficiencies for the benefit of NS shareholders. I will now turn it over to Cindy, who will cover our financial achievements. Cynthia Earhart : Thank you, Mike, and good morning. Turning to Slide 16. Our fourth quarter results show a continuation of the benefits from the sustained and successful execution of our strategic plan. The fourth quarter and annual comparisons exclude the effects of tax reform, which I will detail on the next slide. As you can see, each quarter, we delivered revenue growth, while improving our operating efficiency. This drove our operating ratio lower and more importantly, delivered impressive gains in operating income that fell to the bottom line, producing record diluted earnings per share for the year. Let's take a closer look at the fourth quarter on the next slide. On Slide 17, you'll see our summarized operating results. The adjusted 2017 amounts in this presentation represent our GAAP results, less the adjustment for the enactment of income tax reform. For a detailed reconciliation, refer to our non-GAAP reconciliation posted on our website. Today, I will focus on these adjusted results. Our fourth quarter reflects the revenue growth Alan described, which when coupled with our continued focus on operating efficiency and cost control, resulted in a 170 basis point improvement in OR and 13% growth in operating income. Turning to Slide 18, let's take a closer look at the component changes in operating expenses. In total, adjusted operating expenses were higher by $77 million, reflecting both inflationary and volume related expense increases. Compensation and benefits rose by $52 million or 8%. The primary driver of the increase is higher incentive compensation due to our strong operating results. As in prior quarters, the large increase in premiums on union medical plans contribute an additional $16 million this quarter. We also experienced increased overtime during the fourth quarter of $9 million. Partially offsetting these items will reduced employee levels, which saved $24 million. Headcount was approximately 1100 employees less than the fourth quarter of 2016, and down about 250 sequentially. As we look ahead, we expect all in wage and medical cost inflation of about 1% in 2018 versus the 4% we experienced in 2017. We expect that 2018 stock compensation expense will be consistent with 2017. However, due to planned changes, these amounts will be more evenly recognized throughout the first three quarters of 2018, as compared to the prior year. Finally, for incentive compensation. As you would expect, our Board raised the bar on expected performance for 2018 compensation. As you saw in 2017, the incentive accrual for the first and second quarter typically reflects a targeted payout. As we move into the back half of the year, the accrual will adjust based on forecasted corporate performance compared to targets for the year. Fuel expense rose by $45 million, primarily due to higher prices, which added $41 million. The average price per gallon for locomotive fuel was a $1.95 this year versus $1.60 in fourth quarter 2016. Consumption was up only slightly over last year, which added $2 million in the phase of a 5% increase in shipments. As Mike mentioned, we have continued to achieve record fuel efficiency metrics and we expect our ongoing initiatives to continue to support improvement. Purchase services and rents increased $20 million or 5% due to higher volume related costs of $12 million and other miscellaneous expense increases, none of which were significant. The materials and other category decreased $48 million or 22%. This quarter included $25 million more from gains on the sale of operating properties than fourth quarter 2016. Casualties and claims expenses including both environmental and personal injury were $18 million lower. Finally, reduce equipment and road way material usage also saved $7 million. Moving to Slide 19. You can see the strong operating results fell to the bottom line, producing adjusted net income of $486 million, up 17% compared to 2016. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.69, a 19% improvement. Full year results are shown on Slide 20. We set records in both operating ratio and diluted earnings per share for the year. Adjusted for the impact of tax reform, we delivered a record operating ratio of 67.4%, and record diluted earnings per share of $6.61, an 18% improvement on our 2016 results. Our full year effective tax rate excluding the impact of tax reform was 35.4%. We expect our effective tax rate to be around 24% on a go-forward basis. Slide 21 depicts our full year cash flow. Cash from operations totaled $3.3 billion, covering capital spending and generating $1.5 billion in free cash flow. Free cash flow increased by 33% over 2016, driven by our strong operating results and discipline capital spending. Looking ahead, we expect cash taxes in 2018 to be approximately 25% lower than 2017 levels. This is less than the drop in the effective rate, largely because cash taxes in 2017 benefited from the accelerated deduction of interest expense generated from our two debt exchanges. Now turning back to 2017 results. Return to shareholders totaled $1.7 billion through $703 million of dividends and $1 billion in share repurchases. As Jim noted, our Board of Directors remains committed to returning capital to shareholders and approved an increase in our quarterly dividends to $0.72 per share, reflecting a $0.11 or 18% increase over the previous quarter's dividend. Our capital allocation strategy remains the same. First, reinvest in the business and our network with adequate returns. Second, pay a solid dividend, targeting a payout ratio of 1/3rd of net income over the longer term. And third, return capital to shareholders through buyback. Moving to the shares capital budget on Slide 22. We project total spending of $1.8 billion, higher than 2017. This year's budget supports growth and the continuation of investment in our core assets. We're investing in the expansion of various terminals and infrastructure to ease capacity constraints, and we're acquiring freight cars and support our volume growth. Similar to the prior years, the roadway category represents our programs to replace track, bridges and communication systems. In 2018, locomotive capital will be focused on the rebuild and conversion of locomotives from DC to AC power. To improve customer service and further enhance the productivity of our employees and the reliability of our assets, we have also increased our technology spend. Thank you for your attention, and I'll turn it back to Jim. James Squires : Thank you, Cindy. And now let me provide you an update on our 5-year strategic plan. Slide 24 shows the financial targets that we committed to by 2020, and outlined as part of our strategic plan a little over 2 years ago. As you may recall, our plan was a comprehensive one, built on disciplined cost control and asset utilization, while balancing revenue growth through a combination of volume growth in pricing. As the economic environment has evolved, we have been dynamic in our response to changing market conditions and remained a well-positioned to achieve our financial goals. So let's take a look at the results so far. Through 2017, we've made substantial progress that has translated into shareholder value and Slide 25 shows some of our accomplishments. Achieving pricing gains over rail inflation, a focus that we'll continue in our approach to the market. Improving our operating ratio on a year-over-year basis for eight consecutive quarters and to an annual record for 2017, with a plan to achieve a sub- 65 OR by 2020 or sooner. Achieving double-digit earnings per share growth in each of the last 2 years, a trend we expect to continue. Making substantial capital investments each year to maintain the safety of our rail network, enhance service, improve operational efficiency and support growth. With a plan to invest 16% to 18% of revenue going forward. And we're awarding shareholders by returning capital in a balanced, disciplined way through both dividends and share repurchase. Much has been accomplished by Norfolk Southern and its employees since the inception of its plan and remained determined to deliver upon our commitments. Slide 26 highlights our path forward as we balance productivity with top line growth. Our overall outlook on volume in the current economic environment is for a 2% growth on a compound annual basis. Volume growth in our intermodal and merchandise commodity groups offset a softer demand for coal. We expect that revenue per unit will grow about 2% on a compound annual basis through 2020. We are open for opportunities to grow and we will be unwavering in our commitment to productivity and efficiency. We will continue to build on our initiatives to date as we look for further improvements in fuel efficiency and leverage investments in technology to make our organization leaner. We will continue the effective stewardship of our resources ensuring we have the appropriate workforce as demand evolves and continue to invest in the reliability of our locomotive fleet. Wrapping up on Slide 2017. At Norfolk Southern, we know we can deliver upon our strategic plan, focus on the core principles of safety, service, productivity and growth. As we head into 2018, we are optimistic about the current economic environment and I remain fully confident in our ability to deliver an operating ratio of sub-65 by 2020 or sooner, while delivering over $650 million in productivity savings. With that, thank you for your attention, and we'll now open the line for Q&A. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matt Reustle with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Matt Reustle : Thanks for taking my question here. Just in terms of putting it all together, it sounds like the 2018 outlook includes lot of varying trends between the truck competitive business, contract, remaining mix. Can you talk about the expectations for '18 regarding further OR improvements and should we expect another year where the OR improves or is it - you know, is there possibility where there is a short-term stall in the longer-term story? James Squires : We do expect a lower operating ratio for the full year 2018, and that will be driven on by a combination of productivity initiatives and growth. Alan, why don't you talk a little bit about the truck environment and the opportunities we see for growth on the top line? Alan Shaw : Matt, we are increasingly optimistic about the macro environment in which we're operating in the competitive environment that we're facing. You know, truck expectations have continued to tighten over the last 45 to 60 days. The economists are revising upwards their economic outlook for many of the markets that are important to us. So as we head into 2018, we're very confident in our ability to price into those market and secure growth. The one cause that we have, which I tried to outline is, particularly within our coal network, and the coal indices were export or backward-dated, although they too have risen in the first half of this month. So there's some uncertainty in the export coal market. And then natural gas prices, although they are relatively high for February delivery, the forward curve drops off pretty sharply after that. So that could put added pressure on our utility coal market. Matt Reustle : Understood. So if I isolate merchandise and intermodal and just look at the RPU growth there x fuel, should we think about that business rolling over at rates that are higher than 3% to 4% range that you're shelling or is it a small percentage of the business rolling over those rates that are much higher? Or is it something to do with longer haul business or anything in mix that's there can you discuss that? Alan Shaw : Well, Matt, we will get some strong rate increases in business that is truck competitive. And certainly, that will include intermodal, but there's also a lot of merchandise business that's truck competitive. That's one of the great things about our franchise and our strategic plan is - we have a great geographic footprint. Our strategic plan to pull business off the highway is underscored within this economic environment. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Allison Landry : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to talk about the service metrics, you know, they've deteriorated basically the 2014 levels and I think just 6 weeks ago, you guys talked about either sort of turning the corner with respect to that. So I just wanted to sort of understand what drove the deterioration in December? And then sort of from a broader perspective, thinking about the 2014 levels and absolute terms, we know that was a difficult period of time for the network and obviously, the productivity results currently don't reflect any sort of melt down. So if you could help to walk through the differences between then and now and how that translates into the train speed, as well as metrics that we're currently in. James Squires : Sure. Let me start and I'll turn it over to Mike to turn a little bit more about the specifics. But in general, I want to begin by emphasizing that we remain steadfast in our coming to deliver a quality service that our customers value. So that's our goal. Last year - late last year, the composite service metrics did decline, and we did not live up to all of our customer's expectations, but the commitment to do so is there and ever presence at Norfolk Southern. We believe we have the resources in place necessary to meet demand, now and in the future. So whether its cruise or locomotives or other resources, we believe that we have no systemic shortages and adequate resources on hand. And as the network recovers and service recovers, we will be able to continue driving both growth and productivity. Michael Joseph Wheeler : That's exactly right, Jim. From the service, I will say, Allison, our terminals and the line of a road are fluid. However, the customer-facing metrics and our network metrics lag these and its taking longer to get those metrics and back to where we had been, but we're going to do it. And Jim is correct, we are confident, we got the right resources. We don't have any resources used both from TNE standpoint and from the locomotives and freight cars. So we feel comfortable about where we're going and that's - that is our charge this year and we're all over it, we're confident about where we're going. Allison Landry : Okay. And then in terms of the 2% yields CAGR through 2020, could you talk about the components that are embedded within that, I assume it includes fuel, props and negative mix from the outside growth and intermodal. So if we think about the different components within this, should we assume core price is around the 3% mark? Any sort of color in the different buckets that would make up to 2% would be helpful. James Squires : Alan, why don't you take that one? Alan Shaw : Happy too. Allison, good question and I'm glad you brought that up. The 2% RPU growth is not analogous to the 2% pricing growth. You noted some of the negative mix that we've got in terms of strength in the intermodal market, declines within export. And frankly, our export volumes for 2020 and look at them now is very similar to the export volumes for 2020 that we had, last year what we updated the plan. The difference is we had a huge run up in export coal this year which as you know at least average point as higher than average RPU. So as that pulls back and the industry's pullback, that creates some negative mix for us. We are lean in to price. This is a great opportunity to price for us. We've got a very strong truck market and we're going to price according to the market. Allison Landry : Okay. Great. Thank you for the time. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question. Jason Seidl : Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to focus a little bit on the comments on coal. It sounds like you're concern is going to be more for the back half of the year because it seems the industry as you pointed out are still looking favorable at least in the near term. Am I reading the tea leaves right on my own? James Squires : Yes, Jason, I think we have continued strength within our export market. I've guided to 5 million to 6 million tons for export in the first quarter with an opportunity to exceed that. Last year we had 6.3 million tons in the first quarter and then as the year progressed, it moved up a little bit of 7 million tons in the fourth quarter. So I think there's continued strength in our export market. I am concerned about the natural gas prices and the dispatch and the utility market. So we've guided a 15 million to 17 million tons in utility for the quarter. Jason Seidl : That sounds fair enough. Can we focus a little bit about some of the business that you picked up late last year, your Eastern counterpart sort of confirm that a lot of the business that they've lost has gone too at least one year contract. When should we see the bulk of those roll over and how confident are you in retaining that business that you took? James Squires : Jason, let me take that one first and then I'll turn it over to Alan again. I want to emphasize that we're focused on enhancing our value proposition and creating value at NSC. And we're confident that we can do that by providing that competitive service product to our customers that will grow our business. So it's all about the product, the service that we can provide to our customers. And we also view our primary form of competition truck. And so our goal is to provide truck like service. And that means that the customer who is perhaps is trucking today will find our value proposition more attractive and will go by rail. Alan? Alan Shaw : Yes. Jason, we were pretty clear and we continue to be clear that, the business that we're looking to bring into our network last year would be ones those customers who valued service and weren't buying capacity from us. And we're looking for customers who are long-term growth opportunities. So long term is the key word in there. We're looking for a long-term relationship. And as Jim noted, our primary gains in our primary growth in 2017 is reflective of the market and the strengthening truck economy, and our customer approach and our ability to pull business off the Highway. And we think that will continue and are confident that will continue as we move into 2018. Jason Seidl : Appreciate the color. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Ravi Shanker : Thanks. Just a follow-up on something that was may be touched on earlier, looking at the 2020 targets. How do you offset the mix drag from the growing intermodal versus coal? And does that make it harder to get to the long-term OR targets? James Squires : So let's start here, the plan is dynamic and flexible. And that plan with its dynamism and flexibility has consistently delivered strong performance for the last 2 years. As I went through 8 straight quarters of lower operating ratios year-over-year, double-digit EPS growth. So the plan is clearly working. And we're going to continue to push. We've got a balanced approach to the market. We're definitely trying to grow where we can. We are emphasizing productivity as well. With that balance of drivers, OR and earnings drivers, we're confident that we can get into a sub-65 operating ratio by 2020 or sooner. Ravi Shanker : Okay, got it. And just a follow-up for intermodal side for 2018. You clearly highlighted the tightness in trucking as a catalyst. When do you expect to start to see the benefits? You said that you have about 45% of contract left and negotiated for the year. Is that something that shows up in the first half or do you wait for the second half to see that benefit start to flow in? Alan Shaw : It will continue to move through the year. We started to see pricing improvement in that market of August of last year. It accelerated as we move through the fourth quarter. And as we have an opportunity to move into bid season, which is in March-April this year, that will offer continued support. Ravi Shanker : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Amit Mehrotra : Hey, thanks a lot. Good morning, everybody. So I just wanted to ask one question on the CapEx budget for 2018. If I look up a year ago in terms of the initial CapEx were, you know, the increase is really not that significant. It looks like 75 million or so excluding the PTC spends and within that, there's actually spending declines even in infrastructure. So can you help us think about that, specifically why 2018 CapEx doesn't need to be even higher given the declines in service metrics and may be what's the risk is there that may be some revisions higher? Thanks a lot. James Squires : So Cindy went through the 2018 plan. $1.8 billion spread across a variety of categories, basic infrastructure, locomotives, technology and so on. We're open for growth. If our customers are investing in this economy, we will invest as well. So in the past, we've shown flexibility with the capital budget. We cut where business conditions did not meet our expectations, we would be prepared to spend additional amounts if the returns were there and in a growing economy as well. Amit Mehrotra : Okay. Let me just ask 1 follow-up if I could on tax reform, I guess. I mean, we've obviously seen a lot of companies talk about passing some of that on to employees in the form of may be onetime bonuses. If you can just help us think about how much of the increase in cash flow or earnings will drop to the bottom line from tax reform through any changes some of you inflation expectations with wages or something like that, that we should be thinking about this year. And then just related to that, what are the uses of the proceeds from the cash flow that will actually accrued in the earnings over above I guess the dividend announcement. Should we expect any acceleration in the share repurchase activity? Thank you. James Squires : So let me talk about our capital allocation priorities in general, and then I'll turn it over to Cindy, maybe you go through some of the specifics, which she covered in her presentation. But ours is a balance capital allocation plan. We're going to start of the year with capital spending above what we spent - plan to spend above what we spent in 2017 and we're open for growth investments. We are reflecting their confidence in our company and our future, our Board of Directors increased our dividend significantly. And we will have a robust share repurchase program in 2018 as well. Cindy, why don't you go through some of the specifics of tax reform and its impact on our bottom line? Cynthia Earhart : Sure. Yes, as I've said, we expect that our effective tax rate going forward will be about 24%. I also mentioned that for 2018, that you should expect the cash taxes should be about 25% less than they were in 2016 - sorry, 2017, which may not seem like quite enough and there were some things going on in 2017 that will have a positive impact on cash flow and that was primarily around the debt exchanges. So moving the... Amit Mehrotra : I understand the rates, but the question was really related to the absolute dollar amounts, will some of those dollars amount savings, I mean, I understand the rates. But are their absolute dollar amount savings going to 100% drop to the bottom line or do you expect some of that will be completed the way or actually accrued to the employee base as well, that is really the question? Cynthia Earhart : We don't necessarily expect that we'll see wage changes as a result of this, that's your question. James Squires : We're always interested in attracting and retaining the best and the brightest. We constantly looking at our benefit plans, at our compensation scales, to enable us to stay competitive in the market, and that will be our approach in the future as well. Amit Mehrotra : Got it. That's helpful. Thanks. Congrats on a good quarter, I appreciate it. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Tom Wadewitz : Yes, good morning. I wanted to - and congratulations on a strong year as well. I wanted to ask you a little bit about, may be for Cindy or Jim, on some of the moving parts on the expenses in 2018. I know you don't give specific guidance on these things, but just kind of a directionally. So the incentive comp, $55 million rise year-over-year in fourth quarter, obviously, that's bit of a cost pressure. On a full year basis, would you think that incentive comp is likely down in '18 and potentially a tailwind or would you think of that as flat. Operating property sales will be a benefit in 2017, I just wanted to see if that's also something that we should think as kind of flat when we model next year or it potentially a headwind. I guess, those 2 in terms of modeling - broader modeling questions? James Squires : Go ahead Cindy. Cynthia Earhart : Okay, yes. In terms of incentive comp and I mentioned this in my comments. Certainly, 2017, we had higher than probably average incentive comp that we've had over the last few years. I mean, talk about 2016, it was a lower. In 2015, obviously, it was zero. So when you think about incentive comp, I said, our board has raise the bar in performance, and you'll see us in the first two quarters, we'll be accruing to target as we look at what operating results are actually doing throughout the year. The back half of the year will really depend on our operating results. And if we are exceeding the targets that have been set, you'll see incentive comp accruals growing. And if not, they won't be growing. So that's hard to predict. But it will very much depend on our operating results. Tom Wadewitz : Outlook for wage inflation. Cynthia Earhart : I also guided to overall all in wage and health [ph] inflation of 1% in 2018. Now in terms of the sales and operating property, we have been looking very, very hard at our properties. And we're going to continue to do that and you did see that in the fourth quarter, we had an additional $25 million of gains in operating sales. And we also had increases the last quarter. Those are really the very hard to predict. If we have properties that we're not using in operations and we're not getting good returns for, we're going to look to get rid of it. And I can't really give you guidance necessarily into next year and certainly not quarter by quarter. But I will tell you that we're going continue - we've been on for the last year or so. James Squires : Monetizing excess real state is part of our strategy. Long-term, we will drive lower operating ratios and higher incomes through improvements in rail revenue and productivity and expenses. Tom Wadewitz : Okay. For the second question, Jim, you very clearly focused that - indicated your focus on truck competition that the way you're looking at the business, truck markets tighter. How would I think about that translation to your pricing? I mean truck market, if you look at spot rates up 25%, 30% year-over-year is not a little tight, it's dramatically tight, right? And so truck contract rate potentially could be up 10%, for brokers they could be up 15%. So it seems unusual in the trucking market in terms of the magnitude of rate increases, given your truck comments about how your truck focused you are, could you see unusually strong increases and may be versus historical and intermodal. Is that a reason way to look at it? Or would you say, maybe you'd see unusually strong volume growth. Or - how do you think about that dynamic because it does seem that the truck market is unusually tight and rate increase could be bigger than what we've seen for quite a while? James Squires : Well, let me start by saying that ours is balanced approach to revenue growth combining price increases with volume growth, where that make sense for the bottom line. So Alan we'll talk tomorrow about the conditions out there and the opportunity for rate increases on truck and competitive business. Alan Shaw : Tom, we're really encouraged about the opportunities the pricing into this market. And frankly, a lot of our channel partners are similarly encouraged about their opportunity to price. But it doesn't just stop at intermodal. We had RPU growth of 2% to 7% in all of our growths in the fourth quarter except for coal, reflecting broad strength. And as I noted earlier, pricing accelerated as we move into the fourth quarter and through the first quarter. So we're encouraged about the opportunities that are in front of us, both from a macro standpoint and from a competitive standpoint. Tom Wadewitz : Okay, great. Thanks for the time. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please proceed with your questions. Chris Wetherbee : Hey, thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask about productivity in 2018, just how we think about that relative to 150 in 2017. And Jim, maybe you can step back and thinking about sort of where we are towards this 2020 targets, how do you feel the progress is being made, are you ahead of schedule, behind of schedule, where you thought you might? Just trying to get a perspective on to the progress? James Squires : Okay. Well, productivity performance has been great for the first 2 years of this 5-year plan. $250 million right out of the gate in 2016 demonstrating the flexibility of our plan and our intense focus on productivity as a driver of improvement. Another $150 million in 2017, so we're $400 million toward our goal of $650 million in the next couple of years. We're confident we can get that additional $250 million through a combination of productivity drivers that we had seen thus far, labor, materials, fuel and so forth. So we're going to stay focus on at that. That's a key part of our plan. We've demonstrated the results thus far and we're confident that we can get the full $650 million over the next couple of years, that's a big enabler along growth of our sub-65 operating ratio by 2020 or sooner. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. But no specific number for '18, is what you're saying right now. James Squires : As I've said, we're very confident we're going to get the additional $250 million on the way to that sub-65 operating ratio by 2020 or sooner. Chris Wetherbee : Okay, that's helpful. And may be a follow-up, just on the intermodal business. So obviously a tight market and so there seems like there's a lot of opportunity there. I guess, just may be to want to understand how you think about the capacity allocation of the network. So we've seen some service issues - you have search probably above and beyond expectations. As you look out into 2018, is there a way to think about how much capacity you actually do want to allocate in that truck competitive business. Do you put a cap on that because you don't want to go too far and spend too much money in shorter term appeared and have cycle into consideration? How do you think about that? James Squires : I can, - I go back into the balance of the plan. We are working hard to drive shareholder returns through a combination of growth and productivity. That makes - that means making smart targeted investments, where those investments make sense on the network. In order to capture both productivity and growth going forward, and so that's what's the capital budget is all about this year. As I've said, we're open for growth and you could see additional investments if the returns are there, we'll take our time, we'll do it right, we'll make sure that we maximize the returns from each and every dollar we put into the network going forward. Chris Wetherbee : All right. Thanks for the time. Operator : Next question is from the line of Barry Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Barry Oglenski : Hey, good morning, everyone and thanks for taking my questions. So I just wanted to circle back, did we get any guidance on land sale or expected to land sale gains in 2018? And I only asked because that does swing the model and I think, Tom might have alluded to that. And then also can we get some expectations on headcount looking forward? James Squires : Sure, Cindy, you want to go back over the guidance with respect to land sales and then talk about headcount for 2018? Cynthia Earhart : Sure, Brandon. In terms of land sales, as we've said before, we are looking very, very closely at our properties and trying to make sure that there's a business use for them where they're getting returns on them and we're going to continue our program to monetize where we need to, and where we do no longer need them in operations. So in terms of quarter-to-quarter, annual rate, it's very difficult to predict that, but I will say that, we're going to continue the strong program that we had. In terms of headcount, we expect headcount to be stable going into 2018 compared to 2017. Obviously, we expect to continue to get productivity out of our workforce and we will do that. You may see the headcount vary from quarter-to-quarter because we will be hiring T&E employees ahead of peak like season. But overall, in terms of the entire year, you should see the headcount remain stable. James Squires : So slight headcount, growing volumes equals labor productivity and human resources platform for growth. Barry Oglenski : Okay. That's actually quite helpful. And then Jim, I guess, maybe are we just all looking at the wrong service metrics, because we're all focused on dwell and velocity. I think it came up earlier on this call. Are things on the ground may be not quite as bad as they would - or at least says we would perceive from those metrics? James Squires : Look there's no question in there our work has slowed down and when it slows in the South, itself, people can't get to work, schools closed and there is no doubt about it. The network slows down and we did not deliver the velocity or terminal dwell that we were our customers expect late in the fourth quarter because of those winter conditions. We are very focused on network stability and resilience. That is our goal, as we move through the first quarter, restoring to that, so that we'll have the service platform for growth for our customers and for ourselves. We don't believe we have any systemic resource ripples and that means we have enough people. Cindy just went through our headcount outlook for the year, flat headcount. And we think we have enough other resources as well once we get the networks pulled back up. Barry Oglenski : Got it. Sounds like a good year. Thanks, Jim. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter, Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Ken Hoexter : Hey, great. Good morning. So Jim, just may be following on a lot of discussions focus on the yield side of your 2020 targets. But if you look at the volume CAGR, may be for Alan as well, your volume CAGR of 2%, you did 6% growth in intermodal. Given the tight market, merchandise is only 2% outlook as well, I guess, intermodal at 4%. But Alan talking about accelerating economy, I guess, how do you think about the cost may be falling behind a bit? I guess, Chris was focused before on the intermodal side. But looking at the merchandise target and given the accelerated economic targets, how do you even ramp up in the near term on that cost like to counter that? James Squires : I don't think there's any big ramp up in cost involved. We are going to the need to focus on productivity. And as I've said, we believe you have the resources in place to handle volume growth, foreseeable volume growth in the merchandise network. We're also constantly working on business process at ground level. We are working on some things that we think will improve the consistency and efficiency of local customer service going forward. That's going to take a while. We are doing it in collaboration with our customers. But your roll it out - all up, and we did we have the capacity to grow. Alan, do you want to add anything on the intermodal yield side of that? Alan Shaw : Ken, that's a good opportunity for us. We will continue to push price that will play out over a period of time, starting with transactional business in mid-third quarter. It will ramp up with bid season in the second quarter or early - late first quarter. And I'll remind you that, truck pricing decline overall in 2017, and yet, our yields moved up. Ken Hoexter : I have no doubt about the pricing side and what you've given us, I was more focused on the volume. Just if you looking at 2% CAGR volume and yet you're talking about accelerating volumes in the near term, your ability to handle that. That was the focus more on the merchandise given your 2% target in an accelerating economy? Alan Shaw : Ken, what we've talked about in the past is we're focused adding business that fits into our network. And as you add business into the intermodal network and into the merchandise network, generally, you're running - you're putting it on to the tail end of scheduled trains. So that creates a lot of leverage for us. And it gives us the opportunity to add business without adding compensatory expenses. James Squires : It works very well. Ken Hoexter : Yes. So just a follow-up question, the shift of pension accounting obviously a much bigger for the Canadians. But Cindy, any impact to top rating ratio as you go forward especially given that your OR targets? Cynthia Earhart : Yes, good question, Ken. If you look at 2017. The impact that the change in the pension geography would make. Obviously, now we'll be able to keep service cost in the pension expense - or in the compensation benefits line. So for 2017 that would have had a $64 million unfavorable impact on compensation and benefits and favorable down another net. So that gives you kind of a feel for that. Ken Hoexter : Perfect. Appreciate it. That's all from me. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephen's. Please proceed with your question. Justin Long : Thanks and good morning. So I wanted to start with a question on PTC. It seems like the western rails are a little bit further along in the implementation. So I was wondering if you could just update us on your plans to roll out that technology. And as this plays out over the next few years, do you see risk to service and train speeds during this rollout? Michael Joseph Wheeler : Yes, this is Mike. We are on track to have all the equipment - signal-type equipment installed in the ground as well as our locomotives equipped by the end of 2018. And also be running on over 50% of our railroad. We're at 44% today, so we feel very confident of meeting that goal. That will give us the legislated extension to 2020, which we've always said we were going to do. So we're on track with that. You know what are the impacts to the operation? Obviously, they are. Some of these signals cut over and there is thousands of these things to do, take several 6 to 8 hour of the time that we shut down the railroad and do the cut over and all that. So there is some impact. Long-term, once we get it all installed, working reliably, we don't see any significant service issues related to that. Justin Long : Okay, great. And secondly, you gave first quarter guidance for coal, but is there anything you'd be willing to share as it relates to the quarterly cadence you're expecting over the remainder of the year? Alan, I think you mentioned concerns with natural gas competition and export coal. So just wanted to potentially put some numbers around the moderation and tonnage that we could see over the course of the year. Alan Shaw : Good morning, Justin. With the first quarter, we're looking at 15 million to 17 million tons of utility coal compared to 17.6 million tons compared to first quarter of last year. How we move forward is going to be highly dependent upon weather patterns and natural gas. So that's - we're looking at that very closely, similarly with export coal. There's a lot of strength both in met and in thermal export coal. And in fact, our split between met and thermal export was 50-50 in the fourth quarter of last year. As you're aware, typically, it's more heavily weighted towards metallurgical coal. Now the indices are backward dated for those but they've been for a while and we are continuing to have conversations with our customers, to ensure that we got the resources in place, to handle that business. It has legs. All I can do is point you to the same market factors that we're looking at. Justin Long : Okay. Thanks, Alan. Appreciate the time. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of a Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott Group : Hey, thanks. Morning. So just a couple of a follow ups on the labor line. Cindy, I think you said, for your incentive comp, you're accruing for the target for the first half of the year. I just don't know that means for the incentive comp in the first half of the year is, a year-over-year headwind, tailwind, how much? You made a comment about the timing of stock comp and I wasn't sure I followed what you're trying to say. And just big picture on the OR, when you talk about OR improvement, that - is that inclusive of the headwind for moving the pension? I know its 40 basis points, not much, but I just want to make sure that, that's inclusive of that headwind. Cynthia Earhart : Okay. Yes, Scott. So on the incentive comp, like I said, 2017, obviously, was a strong year for incentive comp. And going into 2018, the Board raise the bar on our performance. And so typically, we will be accruing a target level for the first 2 quarters. Going forward into the back half of the year, it's really going to depend on what our operating results are, whether we are exceedingly targets or not. So that's what the incentive compensation was. In terms of the stock compensation, we typically - if you will look back at our 10-Q's, you'll see that the first quarter expense for stock compensation is much higher than second and the third and certainly the fourth quarter. There was a change that has been made to our plan that changes the vesting period. So now the expense is going to be recognized, spread more similarly across the first 3 quarters and of course, you'll have a similar, I guess to 2017 fourth quarter expense. So that's what the stock compensation was. You also asked a question about OR and pension and what the impact will be. We still - we're very confident that we're going to improve our OR year-over-year, even with the pension adjustment. James Squires : So our OR guidance is inclusive of that reclassification. Scott Group : Okay. And then I'm still not clear on what you're trying to say on the incentive comp are going to tell get us back of the. But when you say you're accruing to a target for the first of the year, does that mean that first half incentive comp is higher or lower than what you did first half of '17? Meaning, you've given us a very helpful guidance the last couple of quarters of it's going to be a $50 million year-over-year headwind, which it was. Can you give anything like that to help because in can - in quarters be meaningful swing. Cynthia Earhart : If you look back on the Q's, in the first quarter and the second quarter of '17, you'll see we're accruing to target there. And - that would give you - I think it will give you an idea of what - you should expect in '18 and for the first and second quarter. Scott Group : Okay, all right. Thank you, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Brian Ossenbeck : Hi, thanks. Good morning, Appreciate taking my question. And so two quick ones. First one, Alan, perhaps Cindy, can you give us a reminder of the fuel surcharge tied to WTI, that you mentioned. Seems like you're shifting a little bit more away from the revenue that's tied to WTI, but where the pricing there right now. We'll we see that become a meaningful contribution in the next couple of quarters? Can you give us an update on when we should see that come in and rough ideas how much, that would be helpful. Alan Shaw : Brian, as I've noted, about 2/3 of our revenue is in now on an OHD fuel surcharge program. The remainder of the data will be effectively public pricing. And that, which under contract is tied to a WTI base program. And within the WTI base program, there are different triggers. So the primary focus is on the OHD base program and we saw a $40 million increase in our fuel surcharge revenue just in the fourth quarter, reflecting that. Brian Ossenbeck : Okay. And then the trigger for WTI, is that still $64 a barrel and for how long? because we're sitting right in about that number right now? Alan Shaw : Yes, Brian, we are. And as I've noted, there are different triggers within the WTI base program. As OR within OHD, $64 is the predominant one within WTI, but it's a well less than 1/3 of our fuel surcharge program. Does that make sense? Brian Ossenbeck : Yes. And if I can just as a quick follow-up, and Alan on coal, the RPU's down about 1% of fuel as you noted, but export volume were up, well above expectations. Looking back over the year, looks like this is a trend for the full year, I'm not sure if there's a been if there's really been a big mix shift to more thermal perhaps, but it looks like it's only volumes that are driving the export - or the coal line rather and with exports been so strong. I thought you might have seen a little bit more price on that as well. So is it the mix shift or is there other structural change that's going on given what was a pretty supportive backdrop for last year, it looks like we're on the same pace for the first early part of this year? Alan Shaw : Brian, I'm glad you brought that up. Let me take time to clarify that. So the two things that are going on, as we've noted, in the fourth quarter, we've had significant decline in our longer haul utility south business. And you'll see that actually our overall length the haul within coal declined year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Now as a result, in the fourth quarter of 2017, our utility North business was - we have more volume in that franchise than we did in the Utility South, typically our mix is about 55% to 60% Utility South and 40% to 45% Utility North. That flipped a little bit, we had about 52% Utility North in the fourth quarter. So that in and out in itself is a drag on RPU. Secondly, you talked about that mix between met and steam. And as I talked about, we have about 50%, 51% of our export volume in the fourth quarter was steam. Contrast that to fourth quarter of 2016 and 30% of our export volume was within steam. We've got and we secured significant rate increases up with particularly within our metallurgical export volume throughout 2017, we started to see those increases in the fourth quarter of 2016. So we got market-based rate increases, we're just dealing with a shift in mix, which drives more steam coal, which is typically lower rated, and more Utility North than less Utility South, and Utility North is typically lower length of haul. Brian Ossenbeck : Okay. Great. Thanks, Alan. Operator : Our next question comes up from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question. Bascome Majors : Thanks for taking my question. I just want to follow-up with one more on the incentive comp. It looks like from what you disclosed this year that the full year headwind was well over above $100 million in 2017. Just to put a finer point on some of the earlier questions, if we go back to target levels for 2018, can you quantify what that tailwind would be? James Squires : Cindy? I think we need to let the year play out. And see how the results trend. That ultimately will drive the compensation expense accruals. But I think as Cindy has stated, you should see some favorability in incentive compensation in the first half of the year at least. And then later on the year, it will depend on the results and we'll mark up or down the incentive comp accruals depending on the results. Bascome Majors : But it sounds like you're unable to quantify how much '17 was above the target level. James Squires : Well, the incentive comp is volatile, I'd give you that. And it varies year-on-year depending on performance, that's the way is supposed to work and that's the way it's design. When we do well, operationally, shareholder benefit then incentive comp increases as you saw on 2017. Going back to 2015, the company didn't pay a bonus because results were nowhere near our expectations. In 2016 was a lower above bonus year as well. And you see that reflected in incentive comp accruals throughout 2016. So what I would suggest is that you examine that pattern of the expense accruals in those 3 years, that will give you some sense of where the balance lies and what would be a target incentive compensation amount. Cynthia Earhart : Yes. I think that's right. Just one other thing that - make sure I emphasize them. We talked about the first 2 quarters. I think you're good to see the first 2 quarters of '18 will look very similar to the first 2 quarters of '17. And also, we'll announce our - the actual payout of our incentive comp, a percentage in the proxy, which will be coming out soon. So you can get a better sense of it than I think as well. Bascome Majors : Thank you for that color. As my follow-up, I do want to be the dead horse on service levels and capacity. But I think today's a backdrop or where you got flat headcount and rising volumes and in some recent challenges to service metrics is just bring back memories of 2014 and '15 investors' minds. How can you get shareholders comfortable that we're not on the cost of what could be a multi-quarter resource catch up in investment cycle like we saw a couple of years ago. And with what we can see externally, what signpost of progress should be watch for? James Squires : You should see improvement in the public metrics, you should see velocity pick up and intermodal decline. Those are not the only metrics we used to manage service, obviously, and to monitor network performance, but those are valid and important metrics. So watch for improvements in those areas. We will keep you updated on other service improvements that we're seeing. We remain confident that we have the resources we need to get to that stable, more resilient service pattern. Bascome Majors : Thank you for the time. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Mr. Spracklin, your line is open for questions. Walter Spracklin : Sorry about that. Yes, mixing all the service and capacity metrics together. I was wondering if you might be able to talk about some of the lines our product segments that you're seeing that were hardest hit and have you've seen any, you mentioned your customers might have not lived up to the customer expectations and have you seen any movement on the part of the customers away from it in those lines that we're seeing the tightest capacity and lower service? James Squires : The capacity is tighter in the southern part of our network than it is in the northern part. We have a less double track, less siding capacity in the South, that's where the trains have attended to slow down and we're facing the most challenging operating conditions today. In the north, quite fluid, we double track, lots of double track capacity, we've made capacity improvements in the northern region going back a couple of years. So it's in the south where we're facing the challenge. We're hard at work in facing that as note, we do believe we have the resources long term, to provide the service that our customers expect. Michael Joseph Wheeler : That's where we're holding traffic for the hurricanes, it really came in from the south. Yes, that's where we feel that. Walter Spracklin : Is there any structural impediments to the geography that will make it harder to achieve some of the capacity increases that you're looking to build out either through double stacking or double tracking? James Squires : Double stacking is really not a concern, we're almost completely double stack in our core routes in the South and in the North. So that's not really the issue. It's sighting capacity, its double track in the South, which is historically we lack. Where it makes sense to shift that balance a little bit for targeted investments, we will do so. But this is really all about good process and making sure that we're getting the trains over the road with the capacity that we have available. Walter Spracklin : Okay. And then flip side of the customer - of the customer question, you've got a new sales person over at your competitor who obviously, brings a different approach to how they sell in - or how he sells in to - or into your customer base. Are you noting any major changes in how that is - how the competitive landscape is playing out? Or are you seeing any, as a result, any disruptive initiatives in your customers over to your network or any magnitude that you can provide to that would be also helpful? James Squires : Yes, Walter. As I've said, our focus is enhancing value at Norfolk Southern. And we are confident that we can do that by providing a competitive service to our customers that will allow them to grow. So it's all about our customers and our service. Moreover, we do view trucks as our primary form of competition, that's like we are working so hard to provide truck-like service to our customers. Walter Spracklin : Okay. Thank you very much for the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please proceed with your questions. Cherilyn Radbourne : Thanks very much and good morning. If I look at your 2018 year-to-date care loads they would suggest that you continue to experience difficult seasonal operating conditions. So I just wondered if you could give some color on that and what that implies relative to returning service to target levels? James Squires : I think that's fair, we've had a tough start to the year in terms of the weather and operating conditions. It just becomes all the more difficult particularly in the southern part of the network when we see the kind of weather that we've had. In existence, we know what to do, we have hard work on it. And we believe we will see a restoration of service levels and network performance as we get a little further into the first quarter. So the volumes are what they are, but the outlook is very bright. The economic conditions are excellent right now and we see lots of opportunities for growth. Cherilyn Radbourne : Okay, and then separately, in terms of the customer engagement strategy that you introduced in early 2017, I think you've had a focus on dialogues with customers entering 2017 to better understand how they defined service and how you could better meet their needs. What if anything do you have plan in 2018 to move that into a next phase? James Squires : Well, the first thing we are focused on is service as a customer defined service. So we talked a lot about network performance metrics, velocity terminal dwelling and so forth this morning and we do monitor those things as important indications of network performance. But from the customer standpoint, what really matters, our consistency, grounded availability, order field, depending on the line of business, much more tailored customer service metric. That's our ultimate goal is to drive those metrics and earn customer satisfaction by delivering the service that they want as they define it. Cherilyn Radbourne : Great. Thanks for the time. Operator : Our next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. David Vernon : Hey, good morning, guys and question for the broader team. When we look at the 12% growth and income from railway operations, is there any additional color or guidance that you can give us around how much of that growth is attributable to the stronger export coal market? We got a lot of questions about what are we buying here with Norfolk? Is this railroad earnings or this commodity inflation, anything you could give us that would help us to understand how much of that tighter global coal market has impacted operating profit, would be very helpful? James Squires : Sure. Well, you saw the increase in export coal volume. We talked about some of the drivers of that in terms of our results. And that definitely did contribute to excellent results in 2017. I might remind you that in 2016, we face a very difficult condition in the coal market, and yet we delivered a record operating ratio and record results in 2016. So the hallmark of our plan is flexibility in the phase of changing of market conditions. Alan? Alan Shaw : David, it's a good point, it's a valid point. Export is important to us. We're focus on it although recognized it's 3% of our volume. David Vernon : I totally understand it's 3% of the volume but I mean you can go back to the '60s '70s and see parts of that Norfolk Western rail line looking like a 50 OR. It's a relatively short haul down the Lamberts Point and it does have a lot of commodity inflation. I'm just trying to understand where - what - how impactful is it, was it several hundred basis points, is it a smaller basis point. I mean you guys have done an awesome job on the OR, that's not the question, the question is really how much of a headwind can we expect based on this commodity markets to earnings for next year. I'm just trying to get a sense for any additional data points you could use to help us - we could use to help understand that there. Alan Shaw : David, recognized a Jim said we had a very difficult coal year in 2016 and yet posted year-over-year operating ratio improvements in each of the 4 quarters of the year, that's the beauty of our plan. Ultimately, our plan is designed to take trucks off the Highway and our read of the tape right now in economic conditions in the truck market is that it's pretty positive. And so we are looking for growth in both price and in volume, in our intermodal and our merchandise markets. James Squires : And finally, David, I would just add, if you're looking to sensitize your projections based on assumptions and commodities, ours is a very broad-based portfolio. Our top line is highly diversified. We have a lot of customer-facing lines of business. Yes, commodity is a part of the portfolio, but it's broad and diverse. David Vernon : Okay. And maybe just a follow-up question on the 24% on tax rate. You're expecting. If you were to think about and in an effective tax rate to use as a discount to that 24%, what's the right range that we should be modeling? I know you're going to be expensed in the CapEx excessive depreciation, but are there other tax yields that would drive that number. How low of that tax cash rate number should we expect in relation to that 24% guide on the book rate? Cynthia Earhart : Well, for 2018, I think what we said was for cash taxes, you should expect them to be about 25% less than the cash taxes in 2017. And that's going forward, however and the reason for that, if you look at 2017, we had some things going on that helped cash taxes primarily around the debt exchanges. So going beyond 2018, if you use current taxes as a proxy for cash taxes and you look at that as a percentage of pretax net income, historically, that number for us has been in the mid-20%. And I think if you look at beyond 2018, that number will probably be closer to the high-teens for cash tax. So that's our way to approximate it. David Vernon : Great. Thank you very much for that added color. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. Ben Hartford : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Couple of quick follow-ups, on the fuel surcharge program, now we're above $64 that we accrued. Any change in the emphasis toward continuing to migrate the programs over to on-highway diesel? And I guess, in that same thing, is there a target of the percent of revenue by the end of the year that you expect the fuel surcharge programs to be on Highway diesel arrangements as a percent of revenue? Alan Shaw : Ben, our primary focus is pricing on the market, reflecting the value of our service. And fuel surcharge is one of the terms and conditions that, that we'll negotiate with our customer base because I cannot offer a target on that, our primary target our primary focus is on driving shareholder value through pricing and through volume growth. James Squires : Alan and his team has done a great job of migrating our field surcharge program from WTI to OHD. That's something we set out to do a couple of years ago. But as Alan points out, the ultimate goal is price. Ben Hartford : Okay. And then as it relates to the NAFTA discussion, what percent of your traffic interchanges either northern or southern border? Alan Shaw : Its' a modest amount. Although, I'll tell you that overall, international business is for us kind of approximates the international business for the United States. But NAFTA itself is a modest amount. Ben Hartford : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our final question this morning comes from the line of Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Please proceed with your questions. Tyler Brown : Hi, good morning. Alan Shaw : Good morning, Tyler. Tyler Brown : Jim, we've heard anecdotes about the drayage capacity issues, particularly in the long haul dray market. Obviously, I realize a dray company, but do you think dray capacity could mute intermodal conversion opportunity this year. And second, are any of your intermodal markets kind of in that 100-mile watermark? James Squires : Certainly tightness in drayage is - is a sentiment tightness in the truck capacity generally. Alan, without the specifics on the length of haul factor? Alan Shaw : We've got over 50% of the population in our network. We touch over 50% on the manufacturing and 50% of the energy consumption. One of the great things about our network as it is very close to population centers. That's why we're confident that our plan will allow us to pick up business from the Highway as truck capacity tightens. We have seen tightness in his markets within the drayage committee. And in some aspects that impacted our volume growth in the fourth quarter. Tyler Brown : Okay, that's great. And in the capital plan, is there any contemplation of adding capacity into the EMP fleet or maybe the chassis pool to support growth? Or would just expect your channel partners to make those investments? Alan Shaw : We are projecting that we will add capacity in our chassis fleet in 2018. But that's already included in our 2018 capital budget, the one we went through today. So yes, additional chassis in the supply chain would be helpful going forward. Tyler Brown : EMP? Alan Shaw : We're revisiting that. We're taking a look at the evolving truck market. Right now we don't have anything in there. James Squires : As you know, we are a multi-channel intermodal provider and the EMP is one of our channels and we have a number of others as well. Tyler Brown : Right. And just real quick, Cindy, I can't wait on the. Cindy, can you give instantly what the '17 cash tax paid was? Cynthia Earhart : It was around, hold on 1 second. It's around $700 million. James Squires : That's footnoted in the analyst book that we just put out. Cynthia Earhart : Yes. Tyler Brown : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I'll turn the floor back over to Mr. Jim Squires for closing comments. James Squires : All right, thank you, everyone, for lots of excellent questions and feedback. We look forward to talking to you throughout the year.",

Operator : Greetings and welcome to the Norfolk Southern Corporation First Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Clay Moore, Director of Investor Relations for Norfolk Southern. Thank you, Mr. Moore. You may now begin. Clay Moore - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Thank you, Rob, and good morning. Before we begin, please note that during today's call, we may make certain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risk and uncertainties and may differ materially from actual results. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. The slides of the presenters are available on our website at norfolksouthern.com in the Investors section, along with our non-GAAP reconciliation. Additionally, a transcript and downloads will be posted after the call. Now, it is my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's Chairman, President, and CEO, Jim Squires. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Norfolk Southern's first quarter 2018 earnings call. With me are Alan Shaw, Chief Marketing Officer; Mike Wheeler, Chief Operating Officer; and Cindy Earhart, Chief Financial Officer. Taking a look at the highlights, as shown on slide 4, we delivered record financial results in the first quarter, even with operations challenges. Income from operations increased 10%. That, coupled with a lower overall corporate tax rate, yielded record results in net income and earnings per share. Net income for the first quarter was $552 million, up 27% over the prior year. And earnings per share increased 30% to $1.93. Our first quarter operating ratio was 69.3%. All of these figures are first quarter records. While we are pleased with the continued progress in our financial performance, we are also confident that we can produce even better bottom-line results as network velocity picks up. In the quarter, reduced velocity meant we were unable to provide the service our customers expect and incurred additional expenses totaling $43 million, as Cindy will discuss later. Mike will describe the various measures we've taken to speed up the network. As service recovers, our focus will be maintaining network stability and resilience, even as we continue to push productivity. We're optimistic about the opportunities in front of us. And with the current outlook for the economy, we are well-positioned to deliver another year of solid top and bottom-line growth. Our nine consecutive quarters of year-over-year operating ratio improvement underscore our unrelenting focus on shareholder value. I'll now turn the program over to Alan Shaw, Chief Marketing Officer. Alan? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter 2018 revenue increased 6% over 2017, reflecting improvements in economic conditions, strong pricing, increasing demand for our services and the benefits of our long-term approach to efficiently serving markets. As outlined on slide 6, we increased revenue in all three business units, with record quarterly revenue in intermodal. Our overall volumes were up 3% as 8% growth in intermodal was partially offset by volume declines in our merchandise and coal markets. Revenue per unit increased 2% with improved pricing and increased fuel surcharge revenue partially offset by the mix impact of strong intermodal growth. Our merchandise volumes declined 2% in the first quarter due to the slower network velocity and the impact on equipment supply, while improvement in pricing and fuel surcharge revenue increased revenue per unit by 3%. Tightness in the truck market and the strength of our intermodal franchise increased intermodal revenue, which reached a record $678 million, a 19% improvement over first quarter 2017. Increased fuel surcharge revenue, positive mix associated with growth in domestic and premium business, and stronger pricing improved intermodal revenue per unit by 10% year-over-year. Lastly, high seaborne coal prices and overseas demand for U.S. coal increased export volume, while utility volume was negatively impacted by a combination of network velocity and weather conditions. Revenue per unit was up 8% with increased pricing which was positively influenced by high benchmark prices and the mix related impact of high rated export coal. Moving to slide 7, we're enthusiastic about the strong macro environment and the fit with our market approach. We expect overall revenue growth in 2018, driven by intermodal and merchandise. Merchandise volumes are expected to increase for the remainder of the year, especially as our network velocity improves. Strong economic activity, particularly in industrial production and construction, will be partially offset by lower vehicle production in our service area. With regard to our intermodal segment, capacity constraints in the trucking industry and our customer-focused initiatives are driving growth. Further, the steady emergence of e-commerce will continue to create organic growth opportunities with several of our existing customers. With these factors forecasted to continue for the near-term, we expect our volumes and prices to improve, with growth in both volume and revenue expected throughout the year. Coal volume is expected to be flat year-over-year for the remainder of the year. Export, which is subject to seaborne pricing, is targeted at the 5 million to 7 million ton range each quarter, while the second quarter is expected to be closer to the upper end of that range. Utility coal is projected to be 15 million to 17 million tons each quarter for the remainder of the year, dependent upon natural gas prices and weather. Overall, increased truckload pricing and rising diesel fuel prices, along with our disciplined approach to the market, will positively impact our revenue per unit for the rest of the year. Higher truckload pricing provides additional pricing opportunity with 25% of our 2018 revenue up for renegotiation before the end of the year. We will grow this year while continuing to capitalize on the components of the larger economy that most influence our business and our customers. We will also remain committed to supporting our customer's growth and strategically investing for the future. This balanced approach drives long-term shareholder return and is one that our customers value. It is a strategy that includes capitalizing on the advantages of our franchise, increasing our competitiveness with truck, maintaining flexibility to respond to changing markets, and most importantly, meeting the needs of our customers. We are confident that we are positioned for success and operational improvement for the remainder of the year. I'll now turn it over to Mike for an update on operations. Michael J. Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Thank you, Alan, and good morning. As Jim noted, we achieved another quarterly record operating ratio in the first quarter which was driven by our ongoing productivity initiatives and growth as part of our strategic plan. In the quarter, we had record train length for first quarter and continued strong locomotive productivity and fuel efficiency. Our primary focus right now is restoring service levels for our customers as we continue to grow our business and build resiliency into our operation. Turning to service on slide 9, we are hiring an additional 400 employees this year for a total of 1,500 in order to better serve our customers, increase fluidity on our network, and continue to handle growth. In the interim, approximately 500 conductor trainees that were hired last year will be qualified in the next four months, which will help drive further improvement to our performance and service metrics. In addition, we had 55 temporary transfers on our Alabama division to address the Southern portion of our network, which is a lower capacity single-track railroad. We also implemented a Go Team concept which consists of T&E employees specifically designed for rapid deployment to areas of need. To-date, these teams have been deployed to two locations in the South and have helped improve fluidity in key areas. On the locomotive side, this is our biggest year for our DC to AC reliability improvement initiative, with 125 of the upgraded locomotives coming online in 2018. To-date, we have received 40, giving us a more powerful locomotive fleet to support our expansive network and operational footprint. In the interim, we are temporarily supplementing our fleet with 90 leased locomotives, allowing us to fully press forward with this AC conversion program and the revitalization of our surge fleet. As our locomotive bad order ratio continues to normalize and network velocity improves, additional locomotive capacity will be created. Lastly, many of the capacity improvements to our infrastructure are underway which help us address growth opportunities as well as various pinch points in our network. One additional improvement is a resumption of through freight operations over our Central of Georgia line between Macon and Birmingham, which are two of our largest hump yards in the South. In the first half of 2017, we idled through freight operations on this line which drove the traffic through Atlanta. But our operating plan is a flexible one, and we continue to react to changes in our business, including near-record volumes. This change has provided more capacity and has been a driver in improved fluidity at these two key terminals. Additionally, turning to slide 10, we are moving forward with our plan to consolidate our dispatch operations at our operational headquarters in Atlanta. We expect construction to be completed by November (sic) [October], with centralization of our new center finished by November. We will sequence the divisions into Atlanta to ensure a smooth transition. The consolidated dispatch approach will help drive a better service product, notably through improved communication, coordination, and process improvements. While there were a number of positives achieved in the first quarter, we are taking action to continue adding resiliency to our operations and strengthen our network and performance. So while there is plenty of work left to do, we are striving to get back where we need to be and are encouraged by our continued ability to grow our business and market share. I will now turn it over to Cindy, who will cover the financials. Cindy Cynthia Earhart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Thank you, Mike, and good morning. On slide 12, you'll see our summarized operating results. Please note that for comparison purposes, 2017 has been adjusted to reflect the reclassification of certain pension and post-retirement costs that were required beginning in 2018. Despite service headwinds, we delivered first quarter records for income from railway operations and railway operating ratio. Our revenue growth and continued focus on productivity helped to temper the effect of congestion-related costs. The results were 130 basis point improvement in OR and a 10% growth in operating income year-over-year. Slide 13 illustrates the changes to operating expenses. In total, operating expenses increased by $64 million with the change largely attributable to higher fuel prices and network velocity related costs. Fuel expense rose by $53 million, primarily due to higher prices, which added $43 million. The average price per gallon for locomotive fuel was $2.05 this quarter versus $1.69 in the first quarter 2017. Despite the reduced network velocity, which we estimate added $12 million in fuel expense, consumption was only up 2% relative to the 3% increase in shipments. Purchased services and rents increased $24 million or 6%. Increases in this line item were due to $10 million of higher intermodal volume-related costs and $7 million of network velocity costs. The materials and other category decreased $4 million, or 2%. This quarter included $18 million of rental income associated with operating property, which, beginning in 2018, is included in the expense category rather than non-operating expenses. This was largely offset by higher derailment related expenses of $9 million related to three particular derailments during the quarter. We also incurred approximately $7 million of network velocity cost. Compensation and benefits decreased by $22 million, or 3%. The primary driver of the decrease is reduced employee levels which saved $24 million. Headcount was approximately 1,000 employees fewer than in the first quarter of 2017 and down about 100 sequentially. Going forward, full-year 2018 head count is expected to remain relatively flat compared to full-year 2017. We will see fluctuations from quarter to quarter as we advance T&E hiring earlier in the year. Incentive compensation was $8 million lower than first quarter 2017 due to previously mentioned stock-based compensation plan changes. These changes will result in these expenses being recognized more evenly during the first three quarters of 2018. Lower health and welfare rates also resulted in savings of approximately $8 million versus the first quarter of 2017. These decreases were partially offset by $17 million related to increased overtime and re-crews during the first quarter of 2018 due to slower network velocity. Moving to slide 14, you can see that our strong operating results were amplified by the lower tax rate, resulting in record net income of $552 million, up 27% compared with first quarter 2017, as well as record diluted earnings per share of $1.93, a 30% improvement over last year. Our first quarter effective tax rate of 22% reflects the benefit of stock-based compensation and retroactive maintenance tax credits for 2017 that were enacted this year. We continue to expect our full-year effective tax rate to be around 24%. Wrapping up our financial overview on slide 15, while capital expenditures are down slightly for the quarter, we still expect CapEx for the full year to be higher than last year. Free cash flow was $433 million for the first three months and over $500 million has been returned to shareholders, up 34% compared to last year. We are committed to continue to return value to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. As you've heard today, we are confident that the successful execution of our plan will drive further improvement in financial results and generate significant free cash flow. To that end, we plan to increase our share repurchases over the level of the first quarter and are targeting $1.5 billion of share repurchases for the year. Thanks for your attention. I'll turn the call back over to Jim. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Thank you, Cindy. Let me close by noting once again the record financial results in the quarter. These results reflect our unwavering commitment to shareholder value. Looking ahead to the rest of the year, as we restore network velocity, we are confident we will have the capacity for further growth at service levels our customers expect. That growth and our many productivity initiatives are a winning formula for financial outperformance. In summary, we continue to make strong progress toward our goal of a sub-65% operating ratio by 2020 or sooner and, of course, we won't stop there. With that, thank you for your attention. And we'll now open the line for Q&A. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Due to the number of analysts joining us on the call today, we will be limiting everyone to one primary question and one follow-up question to accommodate as many participants as possible. Thank you. Our first question is coming from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Good morning. Thank you. So given the OR improvement this quarter despite the service challenges and even weather, if we extrapolate this performance out a bit, how should we think about margin improvement as you're able to increase the network velocity? And are you thinking that a 65% OR by 2020 is fairly conservative at this point? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Good morning, Allison. We certainly do expect to achieve lower overall operating ratio for the full year this year. And, as I said, we are on track toward a sub-65% operating ratio by 2020 or sooner. And we won't stop there. We will continue to drive hard for further financial improvements and shareholder value from that point on. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. And then my second question, relative to the $43 million that you called out for Q1, how much cost creep should we expect in the second quarter and the balance of the year? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: We expect service-related costs to taper off during the balance of the year. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. And should we expect a meaningful step-down from 1Q to 2Q? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: We don't give quarterly guidance. Our expectation now is that, yes, we will see service-related costs incurred in the first quarter to step down in the second quarter and certainly for the balance of the year as well. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah. Good morning. Let's see, I had some questions for you on the revenue side. Revenue side looked very good and revenue per car was really strong in a couple categories. The coal side \u2013 was there anything unusual in coal revenue in terms of kind of liquidated damages or something that gave a one-time boost? Or was this pretty representative and revenue per car in coal could be kind of similar if you look at, let's say, second quarter compared to first? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Good morning, Tom. Let me turn that one over to Alan. Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Tom, there was nothing unusual with respect to one-time issues impacting our RPU within coal. I will point you to the fact that seaborne coking coal prices are declining right now, and that will weigh on our coal RPU moving forward. Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. So consider that in second quarter, I guess, you're saying in terms of coal RPU? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yes. Correct. Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And what about intermodal, also revenue per car in intermodal was very strong. I think you've talked about that kind of ex-fuel revenue per unit accelerating. Can you give us some thoughts on what that was ex-fuel and kind of does that accelerate further as you look into second quarter, third quarter in the pricing and revenue per car in intermodal? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yes, we feel very confident about our ability to price into markets as the year progresses, particularly in truck competitive markets. Truckload rates are at an all-time high for this type of year \u2013 or this time of year. And we've seen 11 consecutive weeks of increases in truckload spot rates. So we're very confident that as the year progresses, we'll be able to continue to lean into price reflecting the value of our service. Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. All right. Thank you for the time and good results. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Good morning. Jim, it seems like your call out, or, I guess, Alan's call out of the $50 million impact in the quarter was the anticipation that there was going to be an earnings miss. And yet obviously as you look back, I just want to understand it in hindsight. Did you kind of double down on the speed of improvements on focus on cutting costs or did weather turned after those comments? Just want to understand your thoughts on the timing and the magnitude of that announcement relative to the results you were able to post. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Sure, Ken, and good morning. Well, we certainly did want to flag for our investors the service related costs we expected to incur in the first quarter, and that was our objective in making those disclosures. As the quarter unfolded, we certainly saw continued progress in a variety of areas in the top-line, as Alan has been through. Also with some of the productivity, progress we made notwithstanding, the operation challenges, as Mike highlighted. Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So as you think about it, you've kind of highlighted multiple times your 65% operating ratio target, or I guess sub to a 65%. You won't stop there. You keep highlighting that as well. Can you put parameters on what you think the network can get to while you're still focused on service, just in comparison? Obviously, your Eastern peer still is aggressively focused on getting towards 60% and making strides. Just want to understand. Do you think there's anything that keeps you from getting to there in an expedited manner? Or is there a difference in just how they are operating, whether it's the elimination of hump yards and the like relative to how you're focused on being able to handle growth where you \u2013 do you not think they can at that point if you're focused on it differently? Maybe just talk a little about that a little bit? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Sure. Well, operating ratio improvements will remain a critical part of our financial strategy, and we will continue to push for lower operating ratios once we have achieved our sub-65% operating ratio by 2020 or sooner. We are also pursuing growth in the top-line, which will similarly boost earnings for investors going forward. So it's a combination of margin improvements driven by productivity, driven by pricing, and growth in the top-line. Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks, Jim. I appreciate it. Great job on the quarter again. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks, operator. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Congrats on the strong results. Just wanted to focus on the incremental margins in the quarter. I guess if I just adjust out the incremental costs that you highlighted, the incremental margins look to be in the 85% level, which is obviously astounding. Can you just help us maybe parse through \u2013 what I'm trying to really understand is Caterpillar came out yesterday and said the first quarter results were going to be the high-water mark for the company, and you guys just put up an 85% incremental margin. I guess the question is if it's pricing-driven, a lot of that maybe could be sustainable. Some of that is mix-driven clearly because coal was strong, and maybe that may not repeat in the second quarter. So if you can just help us think about how much of \u2013 parse out the incremental margin performance between mix and price, and just help us understand how much of that's sustainable as you move beyond the first quarter and into the second quarter and third quarter? Thank you. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Okay. Well, let's start with the top-line outlook, because I think that's going to drive a lot of the opportunity going forward. And so I'll ask Alan to go through his macro outlook and how that flows through our top-line in a second. But I also do want to emphasize that incremental margin will continue to be a function of productivity initiatives as well. Even as we focus on service restoration, we remain committed to further productivity enhancements which will play a part in margin and incremental margin going forward as well. So, Alan, let's talk about the top-line outlook a little bit more. Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Amit, we had 19% revenue growth in intermodal, and so we're very confident in our ability to continue to grow that business as the year progresses. We're moving through bid season right now, so we're securing rate increases on business that's impacted by bid season within intermodal. Within our merchandise network, we started to see growth to start this quarter. As volume picks up, we're going to continue to see that move into the bottom-line. As we've said before, merchandise is our top performing business unit with respect to incremental margins. And within coal, our coal volume was down 4% year-over-year in the first quarter. I am pointing towards some headwinds with respect to declining pricing within the export market, although I think volume will continue to be very strong. And we talked about 5 million to 7 million tons of export for each quarter for the remainder of the year and us approaching the top end of that range again in the second quarter. So, we're very confident in top-line opportunities as the year progresses, particularly as we improve our network velocity. Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And just kind of related to that as my follow-up, if you look historically I guess excluding kind of 2016 maybe, you see almost a step function step down in OR as you move from the first quarter to second quarter, typically, order of magnitude about 500 basis points \u2013 maybe a little bit more than 500 basis points. Now I fully understand you don't give quarterly guidance, but if you could just help us think about \u2013 you did have extraordinary costs in the first quarter that maybe will taper off in the second quarter. Is it fair in terms of the puts and takes to see that normal seasonality hold as you moved in the second quarter and maybe even naturally accelerate given the non-recurrence of some of the one-time costs in the first quarter? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: I think we're going to stick to our full year guidance on the operating ratio and stay away from quarterly guidance on the operating ratio. We do expect year-over-year improvement for the full year in the operating ratio and we are on track to our sub-65% OR by 2020 or sooner. So... Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Is there anything, though \u2013 I mean, I'm sorry, I just want to press you a little bit more, but is there anything in this year that is atypical than past years where you've seen a step down in OR from the first to second quarter? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Well, I can't point you to the volume trend right now. Certainly, volume seems to be following more of a traditional seasonal pattern. We're seeing some of the strongest volumes that we've seen on our network really in over 10 years right now. And that suggests that this year will be a more typical seasonal pattern for volume and particularly in merchandise, which shows that kind of seasonality traditionally. So, you know... Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Okay. That's very helpful. I really appreciate the answers. Congrats on a good quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt Reustle with Goldman Sachs. Matthew Reustle - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to talk on intermodal pricing a bit. It looks like mix is really an ongoing tailwind here. Could you talk about the dynamics there? I think we would expect to see the core pricing increase throughout the rest of the year, but can mix also be a tailwind through the back half of the year, and can you talk about some of the dynamics that are driving that? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Alan? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yeah, Matt, as you noted, we are seeing positive mix within our intermodal franchise as our domestic product is growing a lot faster than our international product. I do agree with your theory that pricing will improve as the year progresses, and due to the structure of our contracts, we believe it's going to provide lift as we enter into 2019. Matthew Reustle - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. And do \u2013 I mean, would you expect that domestic growth to outpace international growth into the back half of the year as well? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yeah. That's typically what we see as our domestic franchise grows faster than our international. That was certainly the case in the first quarter. And that's really reflective of the extremely tight truck market. Matthew Reustle - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yes. Okay. And then just quickly on rental income, it looks like that's a new item moving up to op income here. I know in the past, you guys have guided to about $100 million in other income run rate. It fluctuates a lot. I mean, can we assume about three-quarters of that now moves up into op income and the remainder stays down in other operating income? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Cindy, why don't you take that one? Cindy Cynthia Earhart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yes, Matt. So if you think about other net, there's actually two reclasses going on down there. There's the rental income that we moved up, but then we also moved pension down. So, those two kind of offset each other. If you look going forward \u2013 and there's a lot of things in other net. I think in the past, as you said, we have guided to annually about $100 million. You're probably in a $80 million to $100 million annual range going forward. Matthew Reustle - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.: Thanks and good morning. So I think you mentioned that about 25% of your business reprices over the rest of the year. Could you help us understand how much of that business or how that business is spread proportionately across your different segments? I just wanted to understand which segments will be impacted the most. And also could you just help us understand how much of a sequential acceleration we've seen in the pricing environment? I know you don't disclose specifics, but I was wondering if you could give us some commentary to help frame that up. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Alan? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Hey. Good morning, Justin. More of our business will \u2013 a higher percentage of our business will be repriced within our coal franchise this year. And it makes sense, right, because our export volumes, particular through Lambert's Point, are tied to indices. And so that will fluctuate, and then it will be merchandise and then it will be intermodal. Remind me about your second question, Justin? Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.: The sequential improvement in pricing and any way to frame that up? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yeah. Our year-over-year rate of price increases in the first quarter was sequentially better than the second half of last year. We started to see rate increases in our truck competitive intermodal markets in first or second week of August as the truck market started to tighten. And so \u2013 within the transactional markets, I should be clear. So that is reflective of the tailwinds that we're seeing in pricing in intermodal as the year closed and as we move into 2018 and we expect that to continue moving forward. Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.: Great, thanks. And I guess, secondly. I may have missed it, but I don't think you gave an update on the productivity target for this year. So I was wondering if you could share what you expect that number to be on both a gross basis and I guess net of the network velocity costs that you're forecasting. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Justin, I can't tell you this. We are on track to deliver our $650 million annual productivity savings by 2020 or sooner as part of our overall strategic plan. So that's going well. You know the numbers in the first couple of years in the plan, and we're continuing to march forward. We have a lot of good productivity initiatives in place and we expect to hit those goals. Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. I'll leave it at that. Operator : Our next question comes from line of Jason Seidl with Cowen. Jason Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you, operator. Two quick ones for me here. Could you guys talk a little bit about bringing business off the highways? And have you seen intermodal's reach push into lower lengths of haul because of the ELD this year? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Good morning, Jason. Alan, why don't you take that one? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Hey, Jason. With significant revenue growth that we had in intermodal this year and volume growth, clearly, we're seeing expanded reach and expanded volume off the highway. Yes, with ELDs tightening capacity and every time we take a look at it, it appears as if the impact of ELDs is greater and greater. It is making the intermodal product more and more competitive. Frankly, that gives us more and more \u2013 a better and better footing moving forward for pricing. Jason Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. But there is no length of haul number that you can give out that you're seeing that you're more competitive with? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Jason, you're familiar with our franchise and you know that we've seen a lot of growth in some of our shorter haul moves and to say the inland port in South Carolina. So it can be a function of revenue density on the train, our productivity and the market it serves. So there is no hard, fast number. Jason Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC: No, that's fair enough. Next question is for Cynthia here. Cynthia, you guys had a record first quarter here. Yet we saw incentive compensation down $8 million. Should we expect an uptrend as we move throughout the rest of the year if your earnings are going to continue to improve? Cindy Cynthia Earhart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Jason, in terms of the $8 million favorability that you saw, that really was the impact of a change that we made in our compensation plans and the way that they best. So, and previously in 2017 and before, a lot more expense was recognized in the first quarter. So you will see that we're going to recognize it more evenly over the first three quarters as a result of the change investing. In terms of incentive comp in general, we typically accrue based on our new established targets, the targeted payout for the first quarter, and generally into the second quarter. And then as we get into the year, we will adjust the incentive comp accruals based on the results of the business. And if things are \u2013 if we're exceeding targets, we'll make further accruals in the back half of the year. And so that's how you can think about it going forward. You'll recall that in 2017, the back half of the year we had some pretty significant increases in the accrual in our incentive comp. We had a pretty high payout for 2017. Jason Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC: Well, going forward, I hope you have to adjust the accruals upward. Cindy Cynthia Earhart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Me too. Jason Seidl - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks, guys. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey, thanks. Morning, guys. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Morning, Scott. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : So can you say if you think you would see margin improvement this year without the shift in rental income? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yes, yes, we do expect to achieve a lower operating ratio, even excluding the effect of the rental income reclass. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Good. And then, Jim, big picture, you've talked a lot about how the plan is adaptable here. And I want to address, yes, you have a record operating ratio this quarter, but still call it 5 points worse \u2013 or 5 points higher than CSX, the guidance sort of 5 points higher in terms of the long-term guidance. Is there anything you see that they're doing like the demurrage charges, for example, anything you see that they are doing that you are planning to replicate or want to replicate? And then do you think a margin differential of 5 points \u2013 do you think longer-term that's sustainable, or does it at some point worry you about losing share to someone with maybe a lower cost structure? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Well, Scott, I think you've appropriately flagged one of the hallmarks of our strategic plan, which is its flexibility. And you have seen us pivot and demonstrate that flexibility as we've moved through the first couple of years of the plan. We are continuing to focus on all of the financial targets that we have outlined, and we won't stop there. We will continue to look for new and better ways to drive shareholder value. That's what we're all about here. So we feel a great sense of urgency to drive further financial improvements from here and are working as hard as we possibly can to do just that. We're in a terrific business environment right now, and we stand to gain a great deal by restoring service to target levels for the benefit of our customers. So that's a big focus, and we went through all of the initiatives we have underway to that end. Once we get the network velocity up, we're confident that we will have the capacity to take on further growth with corresponding benefits to shareholders. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. That's helpful. Can I just ask one last one? How do we get comfort in the network velocity improving without meaningful increase in spending or head count? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Well, we went through the various measures we have taken to increase network velocity beginning with crews, the hiring that we have accelerated this year, the temporary transfers, the new teams that we have created to be able to dispatch people to hotspots on the network. We talked about the locomotive leases that we have done, about our major commitment to locomotive fleet renewal this year in the locomotive conversion program. We talked about infrastructure and the way that we had banked a line in the Southern part of our network and are now able to bring it back and to use that line for resilience and for growth. So these are the measures that we are focused on. We are confident that they will produce the desired output, which is an increase in network velocity and an improvement in customer service. Michael J. Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.: And I'll just also - Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Thank you, guys. I appreciate it. Michael J. Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.: We have done a lot of investments in our infrastructure over the years, and we're seeing the benefits of those, particularly between Chicago and Toledo and those areas, a lot of our other intermodal terminals around Harrisburg and Jacksonville. But we've also got infrastructure capacity investments that's in our current capital budget that doesn't cause us to increase that that's already underway around Chicago, around Memphis, around Kansas City, several line of road. So those are also in the hopper of things we're doing to continue to create capacity, improve service and grow the railroad that's already been planned for this growth. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Hey. Thanks for taking my question here. I just wanted to follow up on the incentive comp question from earlier. Just to clarify, it sounds like you wouldn't plan to true-up the full year until you report the 3Q? Or were you saying that could happen at the end of next quarter once you get to the halfway point? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Cindy? Cindy Cynthia Earhart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yes. What I was saying is that normally it takes a while to be able to really tell about what the business results are projected to be for the full year. But I would say that as we get into the second quarter, certainly if we see that these results are better and above target, we'll adjust accordingly. Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Understood. I appreciate that clarification. And it seems pretty clear that both mix and pricing are quite the tailwind in intermodal today. You certainly have a lot of that business, particularly on the domestic side, tied to multiyear agreements and it feels like the changes that have happened in the truck pricing backdrop are somewhat structural on top of cyclical. So I was curious. Under those multiyear contracts, when do you have an opportunity to maybe revisit some of that business that you can't revisit as quickly as you would want to and kind of what could that tailwind mean for your franchise longer-term? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Alan? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Bascome, we're confident that the improving truck pricing and the tightening market, and frankly our ability to deliver an intermodal franchise that allows for growth is going to be reflected in our pricing and our rates throughout 2018 and as we move into 2019. Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : But do those multiyear contracts give you an opportunity to maybe benefit from some of the pricing changes that happened in the last few months, a year or two down the road? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Bascome, I don't want to get into specific contracts. I'll try to give you some color as to what we expect with our pricing within our intermodal franchise as the year progresses and into 2019. Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : All right. Fair enough. Thank you for the time today. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Good morning, Brandon. Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Jim, I want to come back to the long-term OR outlook here. Is this the path forward now where we really lever the opportunities of growth like in intermodal this year and merchandise, and you look to get incremental productivity on head count? Or is there anything like a structural review going on in the network, where I think in the past you've collapsed operating regions from many into few? You've also looked at terminals and infrastructure. Should we expect more structural changes coming, too? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Look, we're looking at anything and everything that we can do to run more efficiently and support growth. So certainly, Mike flagged the dispatch consolidation. That's a big initiative this year to get everybody in one central operating headquarters in Atlanta. And we think that'll produce a lot of synergies and a lot of efficiencies among functions within operations. So that's just an example of something we're doing this year. We will continue to leave no stone unturned when it comes to efficiency, productivity, and growth. Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Appreciate that. And then, Alan, in your comments, I think you mentioned e-commerce opportunities in intermodal. And I guess more broadly, if you maintain this level of growth going out the next couple years, does that change anything on the intermodal footprint in the CapEx planning capacity? I know Mike just spoke about that, but would that require a change in the way you guys are looking out in the future? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: It wouldn't require \u2013 no. It would not require a change. We're going to be focused on adding business to our network that fits within our network and that can drive strong incremental returns for our shareholders, and we're also focused on capital utilization within our intermodal franchise. It's been something that we've been working on for years, and that's a continuing effort on our part. Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Mike, just wanted to come back to a couple things more specific on the operating side. Can you go over just the level of resources on the networking coming down the pipeline as you look at improving efficiency, but also at the big volume opportunity? Specifically on the leasing, have you gotten the remainder of the locomotives that you've planned for over the last month? And in the field, I know you had a new VP of Transportation come in at the beginning part of this year. Is there any other key managerial moves in the field that you're looking to make as well? Michael J. Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.: No, no, not at this time. We did have a new VP of Transportation, but he's been in our Transportation group for years doing a great job. On the locomotives, of the 90 leased locomotives that we talked about, we've got 66 of those on the property, so we've got a little bit more to come back to it \u2013 or come to us. And we do have the DC to AC conversions that will be flowing back into the network the remainder of the year too. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Mike also did mention that we do expect to pick up the pace in terms of T&E onboarding and placement. Michael J. Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yeah. We've moved that up really to earlier in the year than planned later in the year, and not only earlier in the year, but a higher number. Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And are you having any difficulty accelerating the pace of T&E, any difficulty in just pure availability of the employees? And also on the leasing side you've added a good amount in the last month, but can you still get them? Is it really just a matter of the right rate? Or are they not available? Michael J. Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.: You know, we don't feel like we need any more than the ones that we've already got in the pipeline. And you could get some out there on the market if you needed to, but we're not interested in that. Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And just one quick follow-up on just the terminal specific level, if you could talk about the rest of the tier plan to simplify the operations. You've gone over some details already, but specifically on the terminal ops, Chattanooga was switched over to \u2013 changed over to flat switching, but it looks like the dwell has been moved out pretty substantially. So I didn't know if that was a factor of the broader network congestion and it should recover, or if there was something that you need to adjust going forward specifically at that yard? Thank you. Michael J. Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yeah. We will do some adjusting at that yard. I'll just remind you, that yard predominantly handles local traffic now, so you've got more of the local traffic, a smaller number going through there, and that does have a higher dwell. In addition, we use the capacity in that yard to do block swapping now. So our train network does a lot of block swapping at Chattanooga which does help the velocity. We are doing some things still at Chattanooga going forward here in the next month or two to help the throughput on the local traffic that we work through. We'll do some things to help that area out and get them a little bit more resilient to handle some of the swings in traffic there. So we've got more to come in helping Chattanooga so that we'll see those results happen. Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks for the details. Appreciate it. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to come back to pricing for a minute if I could and maybe get a sense of sort of the relationship of renewals versus sort of your overall RPU. And I guess the point I'm getting at is I think there was about 20% of the business that was booked over the last three months. And I just wanted to get a sense if you could give us a maybe order of magnitude between the rate of renewals and sort of the quote-unquote core price? I know you don't give the specific numbers around it, but we're trying to judge sort of how strong this cycle might be from a pricing perspective. So is the spread that you're seeing between renewals and sort of what the trailing 12 months pricing looks like, is it bigger than you have previously seen in sort of up-cycles in the truck market or otherwise? Just any color you can give around that magnitude would be helpful. Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Chris, it's certainly bigger in the truck competitive business. And as we continue to price into that market through the remainder of this year and into next year, we're encouraged about the opportunities for more and more price. Our approach is winning in the market, and that's demonstrated by our ability to deliver 6% revenue growth. And we're confident in the opportunities that we have for both price and volume moving forward. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. And when you think about truck competitive, what do you sort of roughly think that is as a percent of your overall business? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Well, obviously it's intermodal and there's a large component of our merchandise business that is truck competitive. And so our efforts to speed up the velocity of our network, our efforts to provide a homogeneous car fleet, our efforts to improve the customer touch and the customer experience and the digital interface with our customers are all designed to help us compete with truck in both intermodal and in merchandise. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then just one follow-up question on the capacity side. Just want to get a rough sense maybe particularly on the intermodal side how you think about capacity whether it be in 2018 or maybe beyond? First quarter I think intermodal was about 55% of the total book of business. Just give us a sense of maybe where you think that can go to in the sort of intermediate term. Just some rough color on that would be great. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Mike did mention, Chris, that we continued to make investments in infrastructure, and some of those are growth-oriented, capacity-oriented investments. So that is a piece of our capital budget this year and will be going forward. Now we spent significant sums on greenfield intermodal terminals in the past 10 years and we're going to work on driving as much volume as we possibly can through those investments. So, yes, we will add some capacity. We will invest for growth. We are also very, very focused on utilizing the capacity that we have today. Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got it. Thanks very much for the time. I appreciate it. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just a couple of follow-ups on intermodal here. Can you just talk about how your customer conversations have been? Because on the one hand you and some of your peers have had some of these service issues over the last couple of quarters but at the same time intermodal pricing is going up. Can you talk about kind of how they have kind of reacted to that and how amenable they've been to take that price? And also what's their view on the sustainability of the current truck tightness? Is that something that they believe is going to last for the foreseeable future? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Ravi, let me start by saying that we are very, very focused on getting the network back up to speed and getting service to where our customers need it to be. Regrettably, service was not what our customers expect of us in the first quarter. And we know that we must deliver on the initiatives that we've outlined today. We are confident that the steps that we have taken to resource up to the demand will work and that we will see improvement in network velocity. Alan, talk a little bit more specifically about the intermodal customers. Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yeah. Ravi, our intermodal customers are no different than all of our customers. All of the conversation revolves around economics and service. And our ability to handle 8% growth in our intermodal network in the first quarter of this year and 19% revenue growth indicates that the market is very strong and our intermodal customers are seeing great pricing opportunities out there. They're looking forward to pricing into this market this year and next, as are we and we're both looking forward to our ability to handle more business as our network of velocity improves. Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Got it. And apologies if I missed this, but you said that you're resuming operations at two hump yards and also consolidating dispatch operations. Can you talk about the cost impact of those actions? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Let me take the first point first. I think what Mike said was that we have brought back into service a line in the Southern part of our network that feeds two key hump yards in the South, i.e. Birmingham and Macon that have remained in operation as hump yards throughout. So the point was we did mothball a line a few years ago. We didn't divest it. We held onto it for the sake of resilience. Now we are able to bring it back to handle growth on that part of the network. Michael J. Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.: And on the dispatch office consolidation, long-term net/net, there is no cost increases in that. Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. And you are just undoing a mothballing of a hump yard. You're saying there's like very little incremental cost apart from just kind of variable costs? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Actually not a hump yard but the parallel line, the Central of Georgia line that we mentioned. And no, there's a little cost associated with bringing that back. Michael J. Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yes. We kept the line open. It was still in good shape. We just started moving trains back over that route. So it is a line of road area, not a hump yard. Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from line of David Vernon with Bernstein. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for making the time. Mike, I wanted to clarify the head count adds. You said you're adding 400 to the hiring plan. What's the total increase in T&E for the year? Michael J. Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.: The total increase is probably in the 275, 300-ish range net. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: So the net increase in T&E will be in that 200 to 300 range? Michael J. Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Correct. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: And then, I guess as a quick follow-up to that, if you look at the total head count being flat on a year-over-year basis, I think that implies a little bit of additional resource add. Where in the organization would we be adding more resource at this point? Michael J. Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Well, it's pretty much the T&E. That's the only place in the railroad that we're adding. The rest of it is probably having some slow attrition in it. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Slow attrition. Okay. Great. Thanks a lot for the clarifications. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC. Suneel Manhas - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: Good morning. This is Suneel Manhas in for Walter Spracklin. Just wanted to touch base on the intermodal growth you're seeing here. With the implementation of ELDs, the deadline behind us, is the migration of trucking to your lines as strong moving forward, or is the major shift behind us as shippers are trying to secure service ahead of that deadline? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Alan? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Sure. Suneel, we believe that we'll continue to see growth in the intermodal franchise. Frankly, the economy continues to get stronger. Consumer confidence is near an 18-year high, industrial production was up over 4% year-over-year in the first quarter, manufacturing was up, retail was up over 4% year-over-year in the first quarter, and truck rates are projected to continue to increase as the year progresses. And so we've got a great intermodal franchise in the East. We have the best intermodal franchise in the East, and we're going to take advantage of the opportunities that are out there. Suneel Manhas - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks for that. And thinking about on the operating side about the resources you're bringing online here to improve the service and fluidity, at what point could we see that service restored to your target normal levels? Is this mostly a Q1 story, or is this a more measured improvement expected over the course of the year? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: We're working very hard to bring all those resources we've been talking about back online and serving the customer as soon as possible. And so that's job one right now is making sure that we have the resources that we need once we get the network spun back up and we believe we will have the capacity for further growth. Suneel Manhas - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: Perfect. Okay. Thanks for that. I appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird. Ben J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thanks for taking the question. Jim, you said several times you're confident about the steps that you've taken to improve service in 2Q and through the balance of the year. What in your mind is the biggest risk to that confidence? What would compromise that confidence? Is it finding personnel? Is it volume? Is it infrastructure and CapEx needs? What do you think has the highest probability of compromising that confidence in being able to improve service? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Well, there obviously is a lead time associated with bringing resources on. We're working as hard as we can and as fast we can to do that. And Mike's been through the various areas in which we're focused. And we believe that we will have the resources that we need to handle foreseeable volume growth on the network. And so I think the outlook is very strong. We've been through the various reasons why, and we do expect further growth this year. Provided the growth meets our current expectations and we're able to get the network spooled back up, we're confident that we'll be able to provide the service our customers expect and produce the growth. Ben J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: So the color about the outlook, several times you talked about the strength of the outlook from a macro point of view. Obviously I assume recently reached a cycle high. We've had some tariff movements over the past few months. There's been concern about peaking growth. When you look at the macroeconomic outlook for the balance of the year internally based on conversation with customers, would you say there's bias to the upside or the downside as it relates to your macroeconomic growth outlook for 2018? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: What do you think, Alan? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: There's risk to the upside. Ben J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: We and \u2013 yeah. Operator : Our final question today comes from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities, Inc.: Thanks very much. Good morning. Most of my questions have been asked, but I wanted to just ask a quick one on the Go Team concept that you mentioned, which sounded kind of unique. Can you help us think about how many employees you'd be able to deploy to trouble spots in that fashion? Do you have to pay them differently? And how long can you keep them in place like that? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Go ahead, Mike. Michael J. Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yeah. So it is a new concept, and it's intended to help address some of the areas that get congested through episodic events. But the current group is about 70 employees. Not all of them are deployed because you have to have the ability to pull them from the location they're at. There is an incentive for them. There is an incentive to sign up for this and how long they stay and all that. The intent of this is really just for a couple weeks, a couple months to get an area backup as the other resources come online. So we've seen good results out of it so far. We've got them deployed to two locations down South, about almost half of the ones that we had sign up. So, so far so good. Cherilyn Radbourne - TD Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you. That's all from me. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I will turn the floor back to Mr. Squires for closing remarks. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Thank you for your questions this morning. We look forward to talking with you next quarter. Operator : Thank you, everyone. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Clay Moore, Director of Investor Relations for Norfolk Southern. Thank you. You may begin. Clay Moore - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Thank you, Melisa, and good morning. Before we begin, please note that during today's call, we may make certain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risk and uncertainties and may differ materially from actual result. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. The slides of the presenters are available on our website at norfolksouthern.com in the Investors section, along with our non-GAAP reconciliation. Additionally, a transcript and download will be posted after the call. Now, it is my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's Chairman, President, and CEO, Jim Squires. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Norfolk Southern's second quarter 2018 earnings call. With me today are Alan Shaw, Chief Marketing Officer; Mike Wheeler, Chief Operating Officer; and Cindy Earhart, Chief Financial Officer. We continue to deliver record results as our second quarter financial highlights on slide four clearly demonstrate. Income from operations was over $1 billion, an increase of 18% and an all-time record for any quarter in our company's history. Net income was $710 million, up 43% over the prior year, and earnings per share was $2.50, a 46% increase. Our second quarter operating ratio was 64.6%, a 230-basis point improvement from last year and the 10th consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating ratio improvement. All of these measures were second quarter records for Norfolk Southern. Halfway into the year, our strategy continues to deliver improved financial performance. We have produced first half records for operating income, operating ratio, net income, and earnings per share. Income from operations for the first six months was $1.9 billion, a 14% increase over the prior year, and our operating ratio improved 180 basis points. Net income for the period was $1.3 billion and earnings per share was $4.43. As we handled near record volumes, we continue our focus on deploying resources to improve service and remain committed to improving network performance for our customers. Two-and-a-half years ago, we laid out our five-year operating plan and highlighted a number of aggressive yet achievable goals. Since then, we have consistently delivered record financial results. And today, we are more confident than ever that we will hit our targeted OR of less than 65% by 2020. Importantly, based on the significant momentum underway and the dedication of our team, we are on track to achieve that target ahead of schedule. As we've said before, given our operations and seasonality, we do not expect OR improvements to occur in a straight line. However, we have already significantly reduced OR and remain on track to achieve another year of year-over-year OR improvement for 2018. As we've said before, when we get to 65%, we won't stop there. We look forward to keeping you updated on our progress as we continue to take action to strengthen our network and enhance shareholder value. Now, Alan will cover trends in revenue; Mike will provide additional color on the state of operations; and Cindy will detail our financial results; then we'll take your questions. Thank you. And now, I'll turn the call over to Alan. Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Second quarter 2018 marks the sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth with second quarter gains in revenue, volume and revenue per unit across all three of our business groups. Merchandise revenue grew 8% in the second quarter with increased oil and gas drilling activity driving volume expansion in frac sand and NGLs, along with strong growth in ethanol, fertilizers and crude oil. These increases were partially offset by lower automotive volume. Improved pricing and higher fuel surcharge revenue raised RPU 4%. Robust economic conditions and a historically tight truck market led to record-breaking revenue and volume in intermodal. In the second quarter, NS delivered a 20% increase in intermodal revenue, marking the second quarter in a row with record revenue growth. RPU was up 11% year-over-year with increased fuel surcharge revenue, strong pricing and positive mix. Given the projected demand for the NS intermodal product, the strength in the pricing environment is expected to continue. Our coal franchise revenue increased 4%, driven largely by sustained high overseas demand for U.S. coals. The 10% top line growth generated by revenue growth in all seven of our commodity groups reflects Norfolk Southern's ability to deliver both pricing and volume growth and the strength of the economy. Turning to slide 7, we expect continued revenue growth in the second half of 2018. The economy is anticipated to remain strong throughout 2018 with increased consumer spending and industrial production coupled with a tight truck market and elevated commodity prices. In addition, inventory rebuilds are driving increased demand for our services. In merchandise, we expect continued strong demand in many of our energy-related commodities such as crude oil, frac sand and ethanol. We project sustained strength in intermodal in the second half as the truck market remains extraordinarily strong aided by a robust consumer economy. This growth will be enhanced by the steady increase in e-commerce volume and anticipated inventory builds. Coal will be supported by strength in seaborne demand with export volume anticipated in the quarterly range of 6 million to 8 million tons. Utility volume, dependent upon weather and natural gas prices, is expected to remain between 15 million to 17 million tons per quarter. Pricing remains an emphasis and an opportunity benefited by increased truck rates, higher fuel prices and tight transportation conditions across all modes. We remain confident that executing our balanced long-term plan will allow us to capitalize on the growing economy, support our customers' growth and strategically invest for the future. Execution against this plan drove growth in the first half of the year that we expect to continue in the second. Our focus includes remaining flexible in response to changing markets, increasing our competitiveness with truck, and, most importantly, efficiently meeting the evolving needs of our customers to deliver value to our shareholders. I will now turn it over to Mike for an update on operations. Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Thank you, Alan. Good morning. Today, I will update you on the state of our operation. We progressed with our service recovery plan during the quarter in which we grew our business, handled near-record volumes, and achieved a record second quarter operating ratio. Turning to slide nine, we are pleased with the increasing efficiency of our operations. An all-time quarterly train length record helped drive record crude productivity. Specifically, we handled 6% more volume with just 1% increase in crew starts. In addition, we were near our quarterly fuel efficiency record. All of these factors combined to help drive a record second quarter operating ratio. Moving to our operation on slide 10. Our reportable injury ratio was up sequentially, but our serious injury ratio improved 10%. The safety of our employees and the communities we serve continues to be our top priority and where we focus a lot of attention. We are also taking significant steps to improve our service levels. Our service composite performance as well as train speed declined sequentially, but we improved on dwell, which is encouraging. We are more fluid in the south since resumption of pump operations at Chattanooga, which was idled in 2017. To continue to improve service, a portion of the hump was reactivated on May 17 to keep pace with near-record carloads. This hybrid model, which calls for the humping of local traffic while still utilizing block swaps for through traffic gives us the best balance between service and efficiency. In addition, we are increasing our hiring to handle our strong growth. Our train and engine hiring target is now 1,800 for the year, an increase of 700 over our initial plan, which will result in a net of approximately 300 qualified conductors from now until the end of the year. In the interim, we are continuing to utilize our temporary transfers and our rapid deployment Go Team initiatives in our areas of need. On the locomotive side, our DC to AC conversion program is paying dividends by giving us more powerful and reliable locomotives at a lower cost. We have received 75 of these units and an additional 50 will be coming online this year. In the meantime, we are temporarily supplementing our fleet with leased locomotives. 130 of these units are on the property and pulling freight and another 25 are due this quarter. As our velocity improves, additional locomotive capacity will also be created. In closing, beyond simply improving our current service levels, our plan will allow us to handle continued growth. As our resources continue to come online, our operational improvements will accelerate. We are committed to enhancing service performance and are confident we are taking the right steps to drive meaningful improvement of our service metrics in the second half of 2018. I will now turn it over to Cindy, who will cover the financials. Cindy Cynthia Earhart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Let's take a look at the second quarter operating results starting on slide 12. This quarter, we delivered record financial results. As Alan discussed, we had strong revenue growth of 10%, which helped drive all-time record income from railway operations of over $1 billion, 18% higher than last year. We also achieved a record second quarter operating ratio of 64.6%, improving on last year's results by 230 basis points. Just as a reminder, 2017 results have been recast to reflect the required reporting reclassification of certain pension and post-retirement costs. Slide 13 illustrates the changes to operating expenses. In total, operating expenses increased by $107 million or 6%. Let's take a look at the details starting with fuel. Fuel rose by $82 million, primarily due to higher prices, which added $71 million. Consumption was up 5% over the prior year relative to the 6% increase in shipments. Purchased services and rents increased $38 million or 10%. Equipment rents expense rose $14 million, the result of higher volume-related costs and slower network velocity. Purchased services increased $24 million, largely a result of transportation and engineering related activities and higher intermodal volumes. The materials and other category decreased $9 million or 5%. This quarter included $20 million of rental income associated with operating property, which you'll recall is now included in this expense category. This was partially offset by approximately $5 million of increased locomotive material usage, primarily due to an increase in locomotives and service, and $4 million of higher environmental remediation expenses. Finally, compensation and benefits decreased by $13 million or 2%. A favorable Supreme Court ruling was issued in June related to employment taxes withheld on stock-based compensation. As a result, we recognized $31 million benefit for this refund of employment taxes paid on equity awards for prior years. Reduced head count levels saved $17 million over the same quarter last year. Headcount was approximately 550 positions fewer than in the second quarter of 2017 and up about 100 sequentially as we've increased our T&E hiring while continuing to decrease head count in other areas. Consistent with the first quarter, lower health and welfare rates also resulted in savings of approximately $9 million versus last year. Incentive compensation was $34 million higher than in the second quarter of 2017 as we have continued to achieve strong financial results during the first half of the year. Overtime and recrews increased compensation and benefits by $13 million. Finally, with respect to head count, we expect average head count to continue to trend sequentially up slightly in the last half. And moving to slide 14, you can see that our strong operating results resulted in an 18% increase in income before taxes and contributed to record second quarter net income of $710 million, up 43% year-over-year. Diluted earnings per share also set second quarter record at $2.50, a 46% improvement. Now wrapping up our financial overview on slide 15. Free cash flow for the first six months was a record $990 million and over $1.1 billion has been returned to shareholders, up 47% compared to last year through the repurchase of 4.8 million shares of our common stock for $700 million and $408 million of dividend payments. Thank you for your attention. I'll turn the call back to Jim. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Thank you, Cindy. As you can clearly see, we are well-positioned for success as we look forward to the balance of the year. Volumes on our network remain robust at levels that we have not seen in over a decade and we are adding resources to improve service for our customers. Our strong performance this quarter enables us to continue our progress toward our goals to generate shareholder value. We are confident in our long-term prospects for success and the strength of our franchise as we continue to execute our strategy. With that, thank you for your attention, and we'll now open the line for Q&A. Operator? Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question. Jason Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC: Thank you, operator, and good morning, Jim and team. Alan, I think you mentioned that pricing is both an emphasis and an opportunity for you. I was wondering if we can dive into that opportunity part. Is the opportunity continuing to be on some of that truck competitive business in both intermodal and merchandise or are there other areas too that we should be focused on? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yeah, Jason, good point. It is an opportunity for us going forward as I have talked previously about the cadence of pricing. We felt like the tight truck market would lead to improvements in pricing well into 2019 and that's precisely what we're seeing now. And you can see that reflected in our numbers with a 20% improvement in intermodal revenue and an 8% improvement in merchandise revenue. The truck market is exceptionally tight. Inventory levels are still very low and the consumer economy and the industrial economy are doing well. So, there's a high demand for our services and it creates a very good pricing opportunity for us. Jason Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay. Next follow-up question is going to be for Michael on productivity. Can you talk about productivity in the back half of the year? What we should look for? I mean, you just posted an all-time record in train lengths. Is that going to continue or are we going to start to plateau? And what are some of the other areas that we should look for, for the NS to show improvement in two half 2018? Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yeah. So, we continue to focus on train length. Obviously, you have to balance that in the terminals with getting trains in and out of there. So, train lengths will continue on. That's a good new story. The other thing is, as the railroad continues to get better and we've seen the railroad slowly continue to get better, we'll have productivity in locomotives because we'll be shedding the locomotives and not needing as many of those and that relates into lower cost for locomotive maintenance. Recrews will go down, overtime will go down. All those things that come out as the railroad continues to get better. So, that's \u2013 those are the things that will come out as we continue to make the railroad faster. But there's also other initiatives we continue to work on. But right now, our focus is on service restoration but still initiatives in the pipeline that are always on our mind. Jason Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC: Thank you, everyone. Appreciate the time as always. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Reustle with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Matthew Reustle - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. Just looking at intermodal, specifically in pricing there. It remained strong, but it did flatten out relative to the first quarter. I was wondering if you can talk about some of the dynamics there, particularly with mix, international versus domestic? But if you're still seeing tailwinds domestically into the back half of the year, what are potential for reacceleration in that pricing? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yeah, Matt, we certainly are. We just effectively finished up bid season, some of the shorter term business and the more transactional, and we're very pleased and encouraged by the results of the great increases we got there. If you look at our pricing year-over-year within intermodal, it was higher than \u2013 in second quarter than it was in first quarter and it improved with each month as we move through the second quarter. So, as I stated before, our contract structure and the general pricing environment gives us a lot of confidence on our ability to continue to secure price in truck competitive business well into 2019. Matthew Reustle - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. And just to follow up in somewhat related terms. I know it's hard to differentiate between the tight trucking market and what we have going on with fuel prices. But I'm wondering, are your customers talking to you about the higher fuel prices? And do you see an opportunity where some of this market share shift you can actually hold on to as trucking capacity comes to the market? Is there any way to think through that in terms of what's sustainable here from some of the volume growth you've seen from the tight trucking market? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yeah. I think there's some structural changes in the trucking market that are irrespective of fuel. One of them is the growth in e-commerce. In 2004, U.S. e-commerce sales were about $71 billion. Last year, they were about $453 billion. You got ELDs and hours of service. And basically, initially, the impact of those was greater than what was originally expected. And then lastly is labor. It's been almost 10 years since the last recession, so there aren't a lot of truck drivers on the sideline waiting to get back into that market. Matthew Reustle - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens, Inc. Please proceed with your question. Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.: Thanks, and good morning. So, maybe to start with a couple questions on the OR. Jim, you made the comment that you're on track to achieve the sub-65% OR target ahead of schedule. I'm curious if we should translate that into pulling that forward a year. Do you think that's achievable in 2019? And then, more near term, the last few years, you've seen a sequential improvement in the OR in the third quarter. Is that same seasonality your expectation this year? Just curious if you think directionally that's where we go or if there's anything that would prevent that from being the case. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Well, we certainly do expect to have a lower operating ratio year-over-year for the full year of 2018. We've said that since the beginning of the year and that's (00:24:12). Longer term, our goal remains the sub-65% operating ratio by 2020 or sooner. We're making excellent progress on that with our outlook for this year. And so we are in the middle of long-range planning and redefinition of some of our long-range goals, and we'll be back to talk about that more at a later day. But that's certainly a necessary and appropriate thing given the progress that we've made on our long-range plan \u2013 our current long-range plan thus far. As far as the seasonality is concerned, within the year, you do have some of that in each year. I wouldn't expect this year to be different in terms of the usual seasonal pattern. But as I did say, we expect the full-year operating ratio certainly to be lower. Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And secondly, just given some of the recent macro headlines, I was wondering if you could share the percentage of your business that you feel is exposed to international trade. And within that number, could you talk about the geographies or commodity groups where you see the most uncertainty with some of the recent news that we've seen on tariffs? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yeah. Justin, basically, our percentage of volume and revenue associated with international trade pretty much approximates that of the U.S. economy. It's effectively 20% to 30%. Digging into that, which you asked about geography, Mexico is a very modest amount. Canada is a little bit more, but it's still less than 5% of our revenues. The big ticket items are international intermodal, export coal, and international merchandise business. As we take a look at trade skirmishes and potential trade war, we don't see much of an impact at all in 2018. It will be longer than that for supply chains to readjust. Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.: Make sense. I'll leave at that. Appreciate the time this morning. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities : Thanks. Good morning. Let's see. So, I wanted to understand how you make the decision to take on incremental intermodal business, specifically in the environment that we're seeing right now, which is capacity constrained. And you obviously have a lot of different traffic that's competing for the space on the network, so curious to know how you evaluate intermodal and specifically whether it's based on its OR or ROIC. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Well, it's both. We're certainly looking at the OR and the ROIC of that business along with the others as we add traffic to the network. We are \u2013 as you know, we have a multichannel strategy and we work closely with our various channel partners to determine optimal levels of traffic on the network, and so that's a partnership with our channel partners. And we're looking to take advantage of the capacity that we do have and to grow where we can, certainly with an emphasis on volume growth, but also pricing in this environment. Alan, you want to add anything to that? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yeah. Allison, we work closely with our customers and also with our operating team to make sure that we've got the capacity to handle the growth. If it's generating good incremental returns for Norfolk Southern and our shareholders and we have the ability to do it, well, bring it on. You've also seen us close a couple of lanes this year where we weren't generating the returns that we needed to. So, it's a balanced approach. It's a great market for us. We have improved the incrementals within our intermodal franchise over the last couple years. And this year, we've been able to deliver 20% revenue growth. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities : Okay. And just following up on the capacity comments. You mentioned you do have capacity. Is that sort of on an overall basis for the network? And if you had to think about it in some of the big corridors, could you maybe parse out where the capacity utilization is on some of the major lanes? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Sure. As a general proposition, we have more capacity on the northern region than we do on the southern region of our network because we're largely double tracked in the north, but not in the south. Now, that said, with the uptick in commodity's volumes, there's plenty of traffic up north as well as down south right now. So, capacity and capacity utilization are a dynamic equation in our business. We do believe that as the network picks up speed that we will generate capacity and that we will thereby be even better positioned to take on more growth. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities : Okay. Excellent. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Chris Wetherbee - Citi Investment Research : Hey, thanks, and good morning. Jim, a couple of questions ago you had a comment about sort of the long-term planning and sort of implied or sounded like you might be considering making some updates at some point. I guess, I just wanted to sort of explore that a little bit further. When you think about it, would that be in the context or the scope of everything including OR targets and beyond? Or how do you think about that, I guess, in terms of what you might be sort of reviewing or what the timeframe might look like? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Our next long-range plan will certainly be a combination of financial targets, just as our current plan is. It will continue to emphasize operating ratio improvement. That's important to investors. We've said all along that we never plan to stop at 65%. We'll continue to push past 65%. But it's a balanced plan. We're looking to grow as well. And increased return on capital, that will be a part of our next long-range plan as well. The process is underway. We're working hard, focused very intently on developing our next long-range plan given the progress that we have made under our current plan. And we'll be back to talk to you later in the year about our progress in that planning exercise. Chris Wetherbee - Citi Investment Research : Okay. That's very helpful. Appreciate it. And just quick followup on service cost. I apologize if I missed it, conflicting calls this morning. But did you quantify what the actual service cost was in 2Q relative to what you incurred in the first quarter, maybe how that looks in the back half? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Sure. So, we did incur a service cost in the second quarter. They did come down a bit from the first quarter given the additional volume on the network. That absorbed some of the costs \u2013 extra costs we allocated to the volume growth. But we did incur some service costs and service is not where we wanted to be and where our customers expect and deserve to be. So, a part of work on that, Mike went through some of the things we're doing. With that said, we did make excellent improvement in margin with the lower operating ratio and we were able to deliver a lot of the growth we experienced to the bottom line. Chris Wetherbee - Citi Investment Research : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah, I wanted to ask you about, I guess, a couple of specific items in the kind of comp and benefits and maybe how that affects the OR. You had a $31 million payroll tax benefit in the quarter. You had a $34 million higher incentive comp. So, those two seem to offset each other I would guess in the quarter or roughly so. How would you think about those two items going forward? It sounds like payroll tax might be one-time, but I'm not sure if you faced a similar headwind on incentive comp in third quarter. So, I think really, how to think about that and how that affects comp and benefits per worker in third quarter, fourth quarter? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Cindy? Cindy Cynthia Earhart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Sure, Tom. In terms of the employment tax refund, you're right. It's basically sort of a one-time item. It refers back to prior years, so I wouldn't expect there to be any benefit with that really too much going forward. On the incentive comp, that's really based on the results of the company and the business. We had strong results in the first half, so that resulted in an increase in our incentive comp that we recognized in the second quarter. I will remind you that last year we had a similar increase in incentive comp in the third quarter, so the timing was a little bit different. So, as we go further into the year, it will all depend upon what the business results are doing. And it could go up, it could go down, it could stay the same, but it will be highly tied to the results of the business. Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. But the comparison is easier, I guess, in third quarter because you accrued more last year. Is that what you're saying? Cindy Cynthia Earhart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: You're right. There was a large accrual in the third quarter of last year. Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, great. And then, just I guess for the follow-up question, I might have missed this. I was on another call earlier. But, Jim, where do you think we're at in terms of the network investments and improvement? It seems like you've seen stabilization some improvement in dwell time and things and velocity. Are you kind of past valley and you've got room for it to ramp further or just how do you think about your kind of confidence in the path forward on the network metrics? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yeah. Well, I think we are making progress. We've seen a modest uptick in train speeds thus far in the third quarter. Terminal dwell is still too high and we need to push train speeds back up to that 23, 24 mile per hour zone and bring dwell down accordingly. Now, behind the scenes though, we believe we're seeing some improvements. Just a couple of the things that we watch, car counts within our major classification yards have generally been within yard capacity for the last month or so. We watch the inbound pipelines for the major classification yards very, very closely. And those have been manageable. But that's an indication of network fluidity. And the overall active trains out on the network, that peaked probably a month, month and a half ago. That's come down. So, that's a good sign. Still too many cars online that really has not come down, so we're managing that right now trying to get cars online down to a more normal level. So, all in all, I think the network is running better. It has stayed fluid throughout and the traffic is moving. Customer service, not where we want it to be though, not where our customers expect it to be, so we're still hard at work on making improvements. Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks, operator. Thanks, everybody. Jim, Canadian National on their call last night in an answer to the questions around long-term targets talked about having OR targets that are the leader of the Class I pack, which I think was an effective way to communicate it. Given volume, to some degree, is out of your control; to a large degree is out of your control. So, I was hoping you could do the same thing vis-\u00e0-vis CSX. I understand that in any given year, there could be differences for various reasons whether they're short term, mid term or long term. But over time, is there any reason that Norfolk should have a different return profile than CSX? And if you can just help us think about that from a structural standpoint I think that would be helpful. Thank you. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Look, margin improvement is important. We get that OR improvement \u2013 consistent OR improvement is part of our plan. And in fact, we have lowered our operating ratio 10 consecutive quarters year-over-year as you've seen. So, we're very focused on operating ratio improvement. Ours is a plan with balance in it though. We also are looking to grow the top line. I wouldn't call ours a growth strategy. It's a strategy to improve return on capital. That does include growth, but also a healthy dose of margin improvement and capital efficiency as well. So, we're going to continue to push on operating ratio when we get to the current goal of sub-65%. We certainly won't stop there. Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So, I don't want to put obviously words into your mouth, but if I can just think about it, meaning there's no real structural reason, but maybe you guys want to focus a little bit more on growth than maybe some of the other competitors out there. Is that a fair way of characterizing it? Or is that wrong? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: I will say this is a terrific environment in which to grow. And we have been executing on growth by sending that growth to the bottom line and that's how you get to the kind of operating income improvements that we put up this quarter. So, I think in our business, it is cyclical. You better jump on that growth opportunity when you have it and that's what we're executing on right now. Productivity remains a consistent focus. It too is an important tool in getting the operating ratio lower and the bottom line up. Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Sure. Let me ask one followup unrelated to that, just more on the balance sheet. So, Union Pacific obviously and then CSX both expanded the balance sheet in recent quarters and returned more cash to shareholders obviously given the confidence in the business and the environment. Is this kind of assessment of the balance sheet within the scope of how you guys are evaluating your long-term plan, i.e. is the company, is Norfolk Southern evaluating what the optimal cap structure is? Or are you kind of comfortable with where you are today? Just any thoughts there. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: We are examining capital structure and we recognize that with the impact of tax reform we have delevered to some extent. So, that is certainly part of our planning process. We're taking a look at capital structure as well as operating. Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Cindy, can you just update us on where the adjusted gross debt to adjusted EBITDA is as of the last measuring point so we have the apples-to-apples number on how you guys are thinking about it, how the credit rating agencies think about as well? Cindy Cynthia Earhart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Well, we have met with the credit agency \u2013 both credit agencies actually this quarter, and we are committed to maintaining BBB+, Baa1 credit rating. And we want to stay sort of in the middle of that. And we are \u2013 as Jim said, we are currently evaluating our leverage and whether we have some additional debt capacity. And we're just going to (00:39:12) continue to do that. So, that's sort of where we are right now. Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks, guys. Congrats on a good quarter. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets : Yeah, thanks very much, operator. Good morning, everyone. Just coming back on the OR question. And Jim, I always thought that I understood that and it did make sense that you want to have a balanced approach to operating ratio improvement with growth. What we've seen however is that you can have both while there is initial kind of disruption as you realign your network to achieve a structurally lower OR, but that disruption effectively goes away. And we've seen evidence of it certainly with the Canadian peers and starting to see it with the U.S. \u2013 with the CSX. They're generating operating ratio of about 500 or more basis point difference than you, but still in the case of, for example, CNCP, they're guiding to 5% to 7% growth, which is probably as much growth as you'd want. Isn't there a case here to take some short-term pain to restructure your operation a little quicker, take the service hit, but then on a go-forward basis be generating that same growth rate at a much lower OR? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: First of all, we play close attention to industry developments and we're watching our peers and watch what's going on in the industry and open to any and all best practices in terms of operations or otherwise. And we are looking at operating our railroad differently in a variety of ways as well. Let me just give you a couple of examples. We are about to restructure our divisional and regional transportation leadership positions. So, that's in an effort to streamline operations and push our strategic plan at the field level. Those frontline supervisors will have responsibility in the future not only for transportation, but for car mechanical operations as well, increasing their span of control and ability to influence the business. We are bringing our dispatchers into Atlanta. By the end of this year, we'll have everyone centralized under renegotiated implementing agreement by the way. They're in Atlanta side by side with our network operations team, our locomotive control team, our service design team. And that's an industry best practice that we are embracing. And that's a change for us. Something to be said for distributed dispatch in the field, but centralized dispatching is the norm these days and that's what we're going to do as well. We're also working on simplifying our operating plan locally and improving our terminal operations going through the network node-by-node, location-by-location and focusing on a local operating plan at each venue that we can execute well consistently. We're doing that in collaboration with our customers. They are very much a part of that planning process and executing a local service plan that works for them and works for us. So, we're certainly not satisfied with the status quo of our operations and we're pushing change in a lot of different areas. Right now... Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets : Do you see any \u2013 go ahead. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: I was just going to say right now, we are very focused on getting customer service back to where it needs to be as I said. And we're going to add some conductor trainings this year. Mike gave you the numbers. Overall head count was down significantly year-over-year. And labor productivity remains a very, very important objective. But adding T&E is the right thing to do when we have a growth environment like we have right now. Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets : Do you see anything more dramatic as just being too risky? If you take your number of hump yards on your system and cutting them by 70% or 80%, the kind of big \u2013 bigger type of changes, do you see that as too risky to do at this point given the demand that you're seeing? Is that a good characterization or... James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: A classification network that can provide good local service is one of the keys to growth in the merchandise network. Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets : Right. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: So, we have rationalized our yard network and we'll continue to look at that, but it is important to maintain adequate classification capacity. And we closed a couple of hump yards and we brought one back recently. So, it's a dynamic plan. It's ambient (00:43:49) customer service and efficiency. Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets : Okay. And just last question here on pricing. I know you don't guide to it, but is there \u2013 it's a good time to be in freight transportation. You're seeing tight capacity across all modes and that's leading to some standard price increases. Is there any reason why due to mix or contract types or whatever it might be that you wouldn't get the same same-store pricing as your peers? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Alan? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: This is a great environment for pricing. Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets : Yeah. Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: You see truck rates going up contract 12%, spot rates going up, double that. So, as I said, pricing is an opportunity for us and it's an emphasis. We saw our pricing year-over-year improved in second quarter relative to first quarter and we saw our pricing improved as the quarter progressed. And we've said that our pricing will continue to improve as we move into 2019. Walter Spracklin - RBC Capital Markets : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. So, I wanted to just try the margin one a little bit differently. So, if you look over a 30-year period, your margin is 300 basis points better on average than CSX. Do you think your \u2013 forget about what you're operating ratio target is and theirs, do you think your network is structurally better than theirs? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: I like our network a lot, Scott. I think we have an outstanding network with a lot of potential for both efficiency and growth. We go a lot of places. We have great partnerships with our customers, with our channel partners. And we have a terrific opportunity to achieve greater productivity and growth. So, I'll take our network any day. And I think we're going to continue to push on all fronts. We are very, very focused on our strategic plan and developing a successor to it. And that plan will include significant efficiencies, significant growth, and, as always, the focus on safety as well. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And then just quickly for Alan. Can you just help us a little bit, any way to think about the benefit of the WTI surcharges kicking in the third quarter? And then any color you can give us on kind of model coal revenue per car going forward? Just if you think that will be higher or lower sequentially as we go into the back half. Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Scott, so I'll take the fuel surcharge one first and remind you that we've been successful over the last several years of transitioning off of a WTI-based program to a highway diesel-based program, which frankly more closely follows the path of our expenses. So, right now, over two-thirds of our base revenue is associated with an on-highway diesel based program. About 25% is associated with WTI. And the majority of that is now in the money. There's a little bit of a lag associated with that and so we saw that improved as the quarter moved on. More important for us is price and we are very confident in our ability to secure price in this competitive and economic environment. With respect to coal, there's several moving parts in there. One is export. We had pretty strong growth in our export volumes in the quarter. It was up 21%. However, our net export coal, which, as you know, tends to be higher rated, was up 4%. So, the predominance of that came through \u2013 the growth came through steam coal, which tends to be lower rated. And also, we had a little negative mix within our utility franchise. Last year in the second quarter, we are about 50/50 in terms of Utility North versus Utility South. This year, we were \u2013 58% of our utility tonnage was in the north, which tends to be a shorter length of haul. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Do you think those two things, just real quick, the north steam versus met and export and more north or south you think those continue in the back half? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: I think there's an opportunity to grow the Utility South franchise a little bit more than the Utility North going forward. Stockpiles are starting to come down and there's been a lot of heat in the southeast. The steam in met is going to be highly dependent upon overseas demand. The forward curve for API2 is moving up. The forward curve for the met coal overseas is moving down, but it's largely range bound and we don't really see any big catalyst for shock there. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Thank you, guys. Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Does that make sense, Scott? Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Yes, it does. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, just going back to the OR, always decent noise on that metric. But since it is a singular one, it gets a lot of focus. Two, we get a little bit of clarity on maybe a cleaner rate for the quarter and looking into the second half of the year. So, it looks like the employment tax was maybe about 100 basis points help in the quarter. Just curious to see what the OpEx of fuel did to the OR. And then on gain on properties, it's become more prevalent in the railroad industry in general, but can you just call out what they were in the quarter? They're down year-over-year and for the first half of the year, but is that the spot where we should expect them to stay for the rest of the year? Cindy Cynthia Earhart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yes, Brian. In terms of the fuel's impact on the OR, on revenue, we had about $72 million worth of incremental fuel revenue. The incremental fuel expense was about $82 million. So, in terms of a detriment both to operating income as well as operating ratio. In terms of the property sales, we really didn't have very significant operating property sales in the quarter. And those are \u2013 they're difficult to predict from quarter-to-quarter. We've said that before. I will tell you that even though they were not significant in the second quarter, we continue to focus very strongly on looking at all of our property. And if it's property that we don't need for the business, we're looking to monetize that. So, we would expect to see operating property sales going forward. It's just hard to tell you exactly when they may happen because some of these things take a while. Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And can you quantify, Cindy, the actual impact on OR from fuel in the quarter just from an optic perspective because it's essentially passed through? But that sound like it actually was a negative drag as well if I heard you correctly? Cindy Cynthia Earhart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yes, it was negative. Negative. Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Anything on the \u2013 can you quantify the basis point impact on OR in the quarter? Cindy Cynthia Earhart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Well, if you look at fuel, just the price, the price part of fuel, so in revenue, the price was about $68 million was related to price. On the expense side, it was about $71 million. So, for \u2013 on OR, that's about 100 basis point impact. Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you very much. If I could just ask one quick question on capacity. STB is still monitoring service. Service is clearly improving a bit here. I guess for Alan and Mike, how do you think about balancing the network? Can you continue to grow volumes at this clip without taking up CapEx? And just curious if there's conversation internally about needing to improve some of the operating resiliency, maybe cast a wider net with the infrastructure to capture volume growth where it might tick up unexpectedly. Or do you think you can kind of vantage at these levels through higher head count, pricing and some better efficiency to release some capacity in the back half of the year and into next year? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Brian let me take a stab at that. Certainly, the capacity CapEx question first. We have spent consistently in our capital budgets on capacity all across the region. So, if you look back over the years, we have invested where we needed to invest to address capacity tightness at locations on the network. And we'll certainly continue to do that. We're going to try to be very thoughtful about that and very strategic with where we put that money. And that's important for one thing because these are long-term investments. And investments in infrastructure capacity are not a quick fix for any service concerns at the moment. So, we have to be thinking years ahead when we make those capacity investments, where are the pinch points on the network that need to be addressed for the long term. So, in the short term, network velocity and efficiency and customer service really are about injecting crews and locomotives into the network. And that's what we're focused on right now. We take a longer term view of the capacity investments, trying to find places on the network where we can make a real long-term difference by increasing capacity. Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks for your time this morning. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey. Great. Good morning. Alan, just to followup on Scott's question there. Did you update your outlook on export coal volumes for the year? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yeah. Ken, I said 6 million tons to 8 million tons per quarter moving forward. Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thanks for that clarification. And then, Jim, I know you've got a lot on the OR and you keep mentioning you watch peers and you adapt. And I'm just wondering with your peer now at 58% and I guess if you adjust out the 100 basis points impact from the comp and benefit gain, it's a 700 basis point differential. And so just where do you see the cost opportunities? Is it the employment that you talked about? Is it the efficiency? How do you adjust? And then, I guess, on that point, Mike, do you feel like you need to bring in additional precision real expertise into the management team to create some of that overhaul that maybe Walter was kind of questioning about? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Ken, as I've said several times, we certainly understand the importance of margin improvement and we are pushing hard on the operating ratio, and we will continue to do so. Not stopping at 65%, but continuing to drive for lower operating ratios. That is a critical element of continued financial results for us. Ours is a balanced plan. We are looking for long-term growth in this franchise that we can pair with the margin improvements just as we did in the second quarter of this year to drive the bottom line. We \u2013 as I said, we are open to all best practices and we are certainly watching closely what goes on in this industry all across the industry and making a number of changes to our own operations, some of which I went through earlier. And we'll continue to do that. Part of our long-range planning process will definitely be to examine the operating plan we currently run and figure out ways we can run better. Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : No, I understand that. I think you kind of went over a bunch of those points. I was just wondering, where do you see the opportunity to improve, right? You said you're looking at your plan. You might change and adapt and lower from the 65% in your next long-term plan. Just, is it \u2013 is there other particular areas where you see the exaggerated improvement? Is it the network operations? Is it employment? I'm just wondering where you see the biggest opportunities to adjust those changes? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Cost structure in our business comes down to people and assets. Certainly, labor productivity is key. Now, right now, we're focused on ramping up T&E to get T&E back to where it needs to be to provide the customer service. But other areas within the workforce are coming down. And you will continue to see us focus on head count. That's a big cost center for us. Network velocity, spending the assets is a big part of cost structure as well, managing cars online, managing the number of locomotives you have out there pulling freight, managing all of the other assets we have. And we will continue to push on asset productivity certainly as part of this planning as well. Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So, just \u2013 if I can just followup on that, right? Because the biggest differential I guess is when you talked about the employees, right? I mean, it's a significant differential in terms of number of employees. So, are there \u2013 when you look at the network structure, do you have to \u2013 that's why I was asking do you need to bring in additional precision rail expertise to make that monumental change or to assist in that change in order to get those large employment kind of cost differentials out of the network? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: I'm very, very confident in our operations team and their ability to drive productivity, while laying and maintaining a foundation for growth. So, I think we're in great shape as a team. We're always open to outside practices and outside perspectives and we do bring those in from time-to-time. So, I think we've got a good plan and we're going to continue to pursue it. Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : All right. Thanks. Look forward to hearing the details of that next plan. Appreciate the time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna Financial Group. Please proceed with your question. Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Thanks for taking my question here. And rail learning season is almost over. If there's been one consistent analyst question for you guys and your management team, it's some version of why can't you put up results more like CSX's. And while that's already been asked several times today, Jim, I'm curious if you could speak for management and the board on your longer term strategic response to the changing competitive landscape in the east. I mean, into that, I mean in NS's view is what CSX's management team has accomplished over the last year and a half is that driving short-term profits at the expense of long-term growth? And I guess the natural extension of that is, do you think your shareholders will be better served over the next two to three years by the current strategy versus a more aggressive push into some of the operational change that your peer has made? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: We are pushing very aggressively on all fronts to drive results for shareholders. So, we are approaching every day with a sense of urgency and enthusiasm about our performance and a desire to get better every single day. So, as I said, we are always open to best practices. We're watching the industry. We're doing things differently ourselves, driving for shareholder value. So, I'm very confident that we're on the right track and that we are going to pursue a balanced plan that includes both efficiency and growth and we'll produce great results for shareholders as a result. Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : So, does that suggest that while the CSX moves have been very effective in the short term that you think that that strategy purely pushed in that direction could be damaging long term? I'm just kind of curious what the board's perspective is? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Well, we believe in our plan. And our plan is a balance of efficiency and growth, as I've said several times this morning. That really is the right formula in our view. You do need to make the investments for growth. You do need to have a certain level of resources available, particularly in times that are conducive to growth like these times. So, while we are definitely focused on productivity going forward, right now is the time to make sure that you have the workforce in place to handle the business, so that you can grow when that's possible. So, I think our plan will be the right plan for our shareholders in the future. Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Thank you for your perspective, Jim. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, Jim, not to pepper you with another one here versus your competitor, but I do think it's important when you think about the cost structure of someone you're going to bat against especially with competitive contracts, I mean, we know there's not that much overlap in business in the east, but definitely some jump-off here. And just looking at the metrics at least optically, it does appear that CSX has the right formula here with much lower labor cost and higher velocity in the past year. So, I mean, what \u2013 do you have any concerns going forward that while we might actually be quite uncompetitive from a cost structure and a service perspective as we look out into 2019 and 2020? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: We are very focused on cost structure as well, and cost structure is critical in our business. We are an asset-intensive resource, intensive business. And you have to mind those resources every day. So, sweating the assets and making sure that we have the right level of people and other resources to get the job done is critical in our business. And we'll continue to focus on that, very focused on cost structure. You also have to make the investments in order to grow them. So, we're going to make those. We're going to continue to keep the people on the stuff that we need to generate that growth and support great customer service, and likewise for all of the other resources we employ. Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Vernon with Alliance Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning, guys. And thanks for taking the question, and I will not ask about the operating ratio. I would like to know a little bit, Alan, about something that is going right. You guys are outgrowing the market in domestic intermodal by a factor of 1, 1.5, and you're getting a little bit better price. What are you guys doing right in the domestic intermodal business right now? And how should we think about how sustainable that could be over the next, call it, 12 to 24 months? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yeah, that's a great question. We've got the best intermodal franchise in the east. And to pivot off what Jim said, we've made investments in this intermodal franchise over time and that is bearing fruit for us and for our shareholders. And that's why we've been able to deliver 20% growth in intermodal in each quarter this year. And our confidence remains very high on our ability to execute going forward. Our customers want to continue to do business with us and are very excited about the growth prospects in this economic environment moving forward. So, we're in great shape with our intermodal franchise. We've improved price. We've improved the margins on it. And we're benefiting from the investments that we've made in recent years to support this growth and provide a service product. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Is there anything you can help us to understand kind of at a \u2013 from a top-down level? We spent some time with the intermodal schedules, but if you were to think about kind of how your transit times compare versus other transit times in the marketplace, like how big of an advantage is there? And do you see any risk? Or is there \u2013 or there's some structural things that you guys have that allow you to keep that transit time advantage in the schedule? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yeah. We got a great network between Chicago and Eastern PA and then down to Atlanta. Our primary form of competition is truck and we're able to leverage the tight truck market into 20% growth. We're also doing that in our merchandise network. I mean, recognize that our merchandise revenue was up 8% in the second quarter. And if you combine our growth rate in merchandise and intermodal, we outpace the growth rate in truck volume over 300 miles in the first half of this year. So, we have a great franchise whether it's intermodal, coal or merchandise. And we're competing very hard, very aggressively against truck and it's delivering results. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: All right. Appreciate the added color. Thanks. Operator : Thank you .Mr. Squires, there are no further questions. I'll turn the floor back to you for any final comments. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Well, thank you very much, everyone. We appreciate your time and attention this morning. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

LLC Operator : Greetings and welcome to the Norfolk Southern third quarter 2018 earnings call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Clay Moore, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Clay. Clay Moore - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Thank you, Rob, and good morning. Before we begin, please note that during today's call we may make certain forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties and may differ materially from actual results. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. The slides of the presenters are available on our website at norfolksouthern.com in the Investors Section along with our non-GAAP reconciliation. Additionally a transcript and downloads will be posted after the call. Now it is my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's Chairman President and CEO, Jim Squires. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Norfolk Southern's third quarter 2018 earnings call. Joining me today are Alan Shaw, Chief Marketing Officer; Mike Wheeler, Chief Operating Officer; and Cindy Earhart, Chief Financial Officer. Starting with our financial highlights on slide 4. We delivered another quarter of record financial results. Income from operations was over $1 billion, an increase of 14%. Net income was $702 million, up 39% over the prior year. And earnings per share was $2.52, a 44% increase. The operating ratio of 65.4% is a third quarter record for our company and marks the 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating ratio improvement. As 2018 draws to a close, we are poised to achieve another year of solid OR improvement and strong bottom line results. Given the progress we've made in the last three years and the likelihood we will meet our current financial goals well ahead of schedule, we are moving forward on the next round of initiatives to drive shareholder value. We look forward to briefing you on these new initiatives and the associated financial targets at our upcoming Investor Day on February 11 in Atlanta Georgia. Please save the date. Now to provide further insight into our third quarter results, Alan will cover trends in revenue. Mike will give you additional color on the state of operations and Cindy will detail our financial results. I'll now turn the call over to Alan. Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Starting on slide 6. The success of our market approach is clearly demonstrated by sustained growth revenue, revenue per unit, and volume. This quarter marks the seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue gains, with seven quarters of strengthening RPU and eight quarters of volume improvement. For five consecutive quarters we achieved steady year-over-year increases in RPU less fuel which is hugely important to operating income. We have succeeded despite the negative mix impact of continued strong volume growth in intermodal with balanced and consistent RPU increases in all three of our business units. The increase in intermodal RPU coupled with productivity improvements consistently enhances intermodal profitability, auguring well for the future given that intermodal remains one of the fast growing segments of the freight market. The strength of our multifaceted plan generated revenue, RPU and volume growth across most markets in our intermodal and merchandise business units. Our balanced focus on margin, price and volume continues to produce revenue growth, benefiting our top line as well as operating income. Slide 7 highlights the results of our plan that generated 10% revenue growth in the third quarter. This gain was the product of sustained volume improvements, higher pricing and increased fuel surcharge revenue. In merchandise we achieved record revenue, RPU, and RPU excluding fuel in the third quarter. Volume growth was led by gains in ethanol and crude oil. RPU grew year-over-year for the tenth consecutive quarter, highlighting our emphasis on pricing. For the fourth consecutive quarter, intermodal achieved record revenue with two consecutive quarters of 20% year-over-year growth. This increase was generated by records and volume and RPU less fuel. A strong economic environment coupled with a tight truck market continues to drive demand for Norfolk Southern's intermodal franchise, resulting in significant growth. Pricing gains led to substantial improvement in RPU less fuel and RPU during the quarter. Coal revenue was up 3% in the third quarter with positive pricing and export volume growth that was partially offset by declines in our utility market. Our strategy delivered strong results in the third quarter with revenue and RPU increases in every business group, underscoring our commitment to competitive pricing as well as our ability to capitalize on market conditions. The continued strength and improvement in our top line metrics illustrates the confidence customers have in our approach. Moving to slide 8. Our outlook for the fourth quarter remains positive. We expect revenue and volume to improve with continued strength in consumer demand and the industrial economy leading to growth in intermodal and manufacturing markets including automotive and plastics. The favorable differential in oil prices is expected to increase volume in our crude franchise. Coal volumes are projected to be up year-over-year in the fourth quarter, driven by growth in both the utility and export markets. Similar to the third quarter, we anticipate fourth quarter utility volumes to be in the 15 million to 17 million ton range. Export volumes are expected to remain in the 6 million to 8 million ton range. Pricing to the value of our product remains a key element of our strategy and we expect that strategy to deliver year-over-year improvement in RPU in the fourth quarter. Our balanced strategy and franchise have positioned us for growth, allowing us to expand with both our existing customers and new customers, maintain a sharp focus on productivity and capacity and deliver results for our customers and shareholders. We are integrated in our customer supply chains and consistently work to understand their markets, partnering for their success and enabling long-term value for NS shareholders. This sustained and balanced approach to both revenue and income growth is delivering results and we look forward to a strong finish in 2018. With that I'll turn it over to Mike for an update on our operations. Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Thank you, Alan. We are pleased the velocity of our railroad continues to improve while handling record volume for a third quarter as well as achieving a record third quarter operating ratio for the company. Moving to slide 10. Our reportable injury ratio for the quarter improved year-over-year and sequentially. The safety of our employees and the communities we serve continues to be our top priority and where we focus a lot of attention. Our service levels are improving as evidenced by our service composite, speed and dwell all improving sequentially. Additionally, our network velocity as measured at the car level is currently near our highest levels for this year. All four measures are currently pacing at or ahead of our third quarter performance. Turning to slide 11. In addition to improving service for our customers, we're also driving improvement in our efficiency. A record third quarter train length helped drive an all-time record crew productivity for Norfolk Southern. Specifically, we handled 5% more volume with just a 2% increase in crew starts. We also achieved an all-time quarterly record for fuel efficiency. All of these factors combined to help us achieve a record third quarter operating ratio as well as an all-time record OR for the first nine months of the year. Turning to slide 12. To drive further improvements in the velocity of our operation, we are undertaking the development of a new operating plan. The first step is to streamline the railroad which will allow us to move assets faster and create capacity for our customers to grow. This process, something we refer to as Clean Sheeting, starts in the terminals and local serving yards where cars tend to accumulate as they navigate the first or last mile of their trip. The goal is to increase fluidity by reducing car inventories, accomplished in part by increasing service frequency for customers. We also work cooperatively with the customers to create efficiencies in service. We are encouraged by the results we have seen so far as Clean Sheeting underpins our new operating plan going forward. As seen on slide 13, our new operating plan will be built on key principles. As mentioned, it starts with Clean Sheeting which will drive car level velocity higher and lower cars online. This will allow us to build more blocks of traffic in the local serving yards that can be picked up by a through train, bypassing the major classification yards. We will also work with our customers and short line partners on additional blocking opportunities. The blocks will be integrated into the system using different train types and drive further velocity improvements and efficiency. Lastly, we are continuing to evaluate our assessorial program to ensure high asset utilization and capacity for growth. We will provide more details on these operating plans at our upcoming Investor Day in February, including our expectations as to the value we are creating through the new operating plan. I will now turn it over to Cindy who will cover the financials. Cindy Cynthia Earhart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Thank you, Mike, and good morning. As Jim said earlier, we've delivered another quarter of record financial results. Let's take a look at the details starting on slide 15. As Alan discussed, we had strong revenue growth of 10%, which when combined with the smaller increase in expenses resulted in the second consecutive quarter of income from railway operations up over $1 billion, 14% higher than last year. We also achieved a record third quarter operating ratio of 65.4%, improving on last year's results by 110 basis points. Just as a reminder, 2017 results have been recast to reflect the required reporting reclassification of certain pension and post-retirement costs. Slide 16 illustrates the component changes to operating expenses. In total, operating expenses increased by $152 million, or 9%, primarily driven by higher fuel prices and volume-related costs. Fuel rose by $76 million, primarily due to higher prices which added $65 million. Consumption was up 4% over the prior year relative to the 5% increase in shipments. Purchased services and rents increased $73 million or 19%. About half of the increase was attributable to higher expenses for purchased services including volume-related increases, additional transportation and engineering activities, as well as higher technology costs. Higher equipment rents expense reflected slower network velocity, the cost of additional short-term locomotive resources, as well as the growth in traffic volume. We expect about half of these additional equipment rent costs to come out in the fourth quarter. The materials and other category increased $38 million or 23%. Last year's gains on the sale of property were approximately $36 million more than the current year. We have also incurred increases in derailment related expenses and additional costs associated with the ongoing relocation of our dispatchers to Atlanta. This year also includes higher locomotive material usage costs due to more locomotives in service. These amounts were partially offset by $20 million of rental income associated with operating property, which you will recall is now included in this expense category. Finally, compensation and benefits decreased by $46 million or 6%. Incentive compensation was $45 million lower than in the third quarter of 2017, based on the timing of accruals, which were a headwind in the third quarter last year. Reduced head count levels saved $10 million over the same quarter last year. Headcount was approximately 320 positions fewer than in the third quarter of 2017 and down about 100 sequentially. Consistent with the first two quarters, lower health and welfare rates also resulted in savings of approximately $8 million versus last year. Overtime and recrews added $15 million of costs. And moving to slide 17, you can see a summarized look at our record third quarter results. Income before income taxes increased 14% and we achieved record third quarter net income of $702 million, up 39% from last year. Diluted earnings per share was also a third quarter record of $2.52, a 44% improvement year-over-year. Wrapping up our financial overview on slide 18, free cash flow for the first nine months was a record $1.6 billion and over $2.9 billion has been returned to shareholders via a 19% increase in dividends as well as share repurchases through both the previously announced accelerated share repurchase program and our ongoing open market purchase program. Our share repurchase programs underscore our confidence in the business as we continue to drive growth and create shareholder value. I'll conclude my remarks by saying the third quarter financial results demonstrate our continued commitment to deliver on our strategic plan objectives and to drive ongoing improvements. Thank you for your attention and I'll turn the call back to Jim. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Thank you, Cindy. Guided by the strategic plan we announced in late 2015, thanks to the hard work of our management team and employees we have consistently achieved the results we promise shareholders. This year we are on track for another year of OR improvement and strong bottom line growth and we are confident we will make further progress next year and beyond. In the last few months, we have begun overhauling our railroad from top to bottom, leaving no stone unturned in the quest for efficiency, growth and shareholder value. As we revamp how we operate, we will listen to our customers and find new ways of meeting their needs. We will use our knowledge of our company to innovate from within. We will bring in outsiders where they have experience or skills we lack. We will collaborate with our supply chain partners and others to learn their best practices and, yes, as you just heard from Mike, we will implement PSR principles where they lead to a better result for customers and shareholders. All of the above, we are open to all good ideas that will advance customer service and shareholder value regardless of the source. In summary, we are excited about the momentum we have today and intend to deliver on our promises in the future as we have in the past. We look forward to announcing new financial targets at are Investor Day in February and to showing you the path we will take to get there. Thank you for your attention. We will now open the line for Q&A. Operator? Operator : Our first question is coming from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. It's certainly great to hear about implementing precision railroading. Jim, just on one of your last comments you mentioned that you guys are trying to implement it as long as it improves customer service and enhances shareholder value. So is there anything that maybe you see in PSR that may not fulfill those two initiatives? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Well, Allison, as I said, ours will be an all of the above approach to improving customer service and productivity. We will implement PSR principles where they can allow us to better serve our customers and shareholders along with ideas we get from our customers, our supply chain partners, from those both inside and outside the company today. We will endeavor to implement a new operating plan while minimizing service disruption. And we're not going to sit out growth while we do so. This remains an environment very conducive to growth and we're determined to capitalize on it. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Just, I guess, thinking about that. Does that tell us that maybe you're not fully embracing it? Like we've seen at CSX? And perhaps maybe you're taking a similar approach as Union Pacific. Is that a fair way to think about it? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: We're looking at everything out there including elements of PSR that are complementary to our strategy. So it's too soon to go into the specifics of our new plan. We will give you those specifics in February along with the new financial goals, but suffice it to say, our goal is to produce a railroad that provides a more consistent service product at a lower cost. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay, great. And then if I could just get in my follow-up question. Could you help us to frame or quantify how much the network inefficiencies cost you in the quarter? I know that there were some elevated equipment costs and some derailment costs and, of course, the network velocity and whatnot. Maybe if you could help us to understand what the impact of that was in the quarter? Thank you. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Sure. Well, we did have some lingering service-related busts as we indicated we would last quarter. Cindy can give you some more specifics on the individual line items. But despite the additional expenses we were able to produce another quarter of year-over-year operating ratio improvement and significant incremental margin from the growth. Cindy? Cindy Cynthia Earhart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Sure. Allison, you're right. We did continue to have some network velocity costs. We have not quantified those really since the first quarter. We do continue to see them come down somewhat. You did see some elevated equipment rent. As I pointed out in my comments, we expect about half of the increase of what you saw in equipment rents to come out in the fourth quarter. And we expect velocity cost to continue to come down as the service improves. Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great. Thank you so much for the time. Operator : Next question comes from Jason Seidl with Cowen and Company. Jason Seidl - Cowen Securities : Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. I want to switch it up and talk a little bit about intermodal here for a minute. Obviously, you've been growing in that area and that's part of your growth plan going forward. We're still in a fairly tight truck market right now, but as you guys know that changes over time. Can you talk about the plan and how much it's predicated on trucking capacity being tight out east and what Norfolk can do to grow that even in, let's say, a flat truck market as opposed to a tight truck market? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Alan, I'll let you take that one. Let me say, though, that intermodal has been a consistent grower for us through tight and less tight truck markets. Alan? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Jason, we've grown our revenue in intermodal year-over-year for eight consecutive quarters. And as Jim notes, that includes a very loose truck market at the end of 2016 and early 2017 and then what we're experiencing right now. We're very encouraged by what we're hearing from our channel partners with respect to the outlook for next year. We still expect truck rates to go up. We still expect intermodal loadings to go up next year and there is a gap there between intermodal pricing and truck market pricing that we're going to lean into and to be able to price into. Jason Seidl - Cowen Securities : And I'll link this to your new operating plan. And I understand the details will be given at the Investor Day, but how crucial is the new operating plan to continuing to grow intermodal? And even more importantly, continuing to realize the price for your services? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Alan? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Jason we have a great intermodal franchise. And we run a lot of point-to-point trains in that franchise. And we're working very closely with our customers and within the operations division on improving the productivity. And you're seeing that reflected in bottom line results. And we're going to continue to focus on price. We've talked earlier about the cadence of pricing opportunities within intermodal would last well into 2019. We still expect that to occur and we're going to continue to focus on productivity. Jason Seidl - Cowen Securities : Appreciate the comment, as always. Operator : Our next question comes the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.: Thanks and good morning. So I was wondering if you could talk about the timing and scale of implementing this new operating plan. Just wanted to get a better understanding of how we should think about the rollout and, as you go through this process, would you be open to the idea of bringing someone in with PSR experience in some of these operating principles? Or do you feel confident with the team you currently have in place? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Justin, let me take the second part of that question and then I'll let Mike talk about the sequence of events. Obviously we are going to give you more detail on the new operating plan in February. We have brought in those with PSR experience and we will continue to do so, recognizing that we don't have a monopoly on good ideas and that we can benefit from the perspective of those outside the company who have implemented PSR principles and other best practices. Mike? Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yes. So talking about our plan, we are currently doing the Clean Sheeting now. We're currently out across the railroad looking at our local serving yards and terminals and working with customers in how we get that done. And we will be doing that for several months now. And at February at the Investor Day, then we'll start telling you about what we're going to do with the operating plan that's been developed from the Clean Sheeting that we've done across the railroad. But there'll be different cadences to this. We're going to do certain changes to the operating plan, get that in place, get the benefits of that across the supply chain and then we'll take another step forward, harvest some more benefits. So it's going to have cadence too where we do some, do some more and continue to get the benefits. Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. And secondly, it seems like one of the areas of focus in the new strategic plan will be reducing equipment on the network. You mentioned cars online. Do you have any initial thoughts on how locomotives and rail car needs could change over the next couple of years? Just curious what you see as the targeted size of your equipment fleet relative to where it is today? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: We'll give you more information on those kinds of targets in February. Obviously, better locomotive and freight car productivity will be key elements of the plan. As Mike went through, one of the big goals is to drive down cars online and increase overall network velocity. That implies significant productivity in both locomotive and freight car categories. Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. I'll leave it at that. Thanks for the time. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions. Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks, operator. Hi, everybody. So I fully appreciate, I guess, the time it takes to form and communicate a new operating plan. So we can certainly wait until February for that and I look forward to that. But a plan I think is probably devised with some specific targets in mind or some philosophical view about what the returns in the business should be either on an absolute basis but probably more appropriately relative to what the benchmarks are achieving in the space. So I know I asked this exact same question last quarter. So forgive me. But Jim, as you think about what the company is managing to now actively, are there any structural reasons for the profitability in Norfolk Southern to be any different than CSX in kind of over a mid- to long-term timeframe? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Our financial objectives in the next long-range plan will be the same sorts of objectives that we have driven toward in the current long-range plan, i.e. both top line growth and, of course, earnings growth through a combination of revenue and margin improvement. The latter being critical to financial success in our industry. We certainly recognize that and will be pushing hard for significantly lower operating ratios in the next plan. We will also be focused on return on capital. That too is a critical metric in our industry. The railroads being a capital intensive business, we focus heavily on return on capital. So you will see objectives in each of those categories in February and I can assure you they will be aggressive goals. We're working hard on them and putting in place the specific initiatives that will allow us to drive shareholder value. Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you for that. And then just one follow-up for me. Last quarter you and Cindy talked about the balance sheet being evaluated to have an optimal capital structure. I fully understand the operating plan takes maybe a long time to formulate, but the balance sheet action should be, I think, relatively straightforward given your communications with the credit rating agencies. You did raise some debt. You did an accelerated share repurchase relatively recently. Is that all we should expect on that front or should we expect some communication or can you update us now on where you think the optimal leverage for the company is? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: I'll turn it over to Cindy for her thoughts on financial strategy, but let me say again what we have achieved thus far. In 2018 alone for the year-to-date, $2.9 billion in capital returned to shareholders via a 19% increase in dividends and the ASR normal course share buybacks. Cindy? Cindy Cynthia Earhart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: We will continue to evaluate the balance sheet. But I will say that, as we said, in the last quarter that we feel pretty comfortable with the credit bands that we're in and kind of sitting in the middle of that range. We will continue to look at it and we continue to talk about that and we'll update you again in February. But for now I think we're comfortable in that range. Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Okay, guys, thanks so much. Good luck with everything, appreciate it. Operator : The next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions. Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey, thanks, good morning guys. First wanted to start on the pricing side. Alan, you kind of mentioned a little bit of what was going on in the intermodal side. I think you also mentioned some improvements on the coal side too. But as you take this, start to think about 2019, presumably there is sort of a bigger percentage of your contracts that may come up in the earlier part of 2019. Just want to get a sense of maybe how we should be thinking about the momentum? Is there an opportunity to get better price in 2019 or some the factors that you're kind of seeing now potentially with volume decelerating, at least growth decelerating a bit, will that have an impact? Just want to get a sense of maybe how you're thinking about the setup in the context of the new operating plan you're doing, will pricing will be a greater tailwind in 2019? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Chris, great question. Pricing is going to be a key component of our plan moving forward, as it is now. The price that we secured in the third quarter was the highest level that it has been in six years and we set a quarterly record for price within our intermodal franchise. As I've noted, we see a lot of strength and support for pricing moving well into 2019, particularly in truck competitive markets. Coal pricing is going to be dictated by seaborne coking coal prices, which right now remain elevated, and natural gas prices which right now are fairly strong. There's a lot of strength in our truck competitive markets. And so we continue to see opportunity and momentum within pricing for our intermodal and our merchandise franchise. Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay, okay, that's helpful. And then just maybe a detail question here, when you're thinking about head count, I guess maybe putting the new operating plan aside for the time being. As you're thinking about the next quarter or two, maybe this is a question for Cindy, how should we be thinking about the cadence of head count growth or contraction? You've had a nice deceleration here. Volume growth continues to be pretty decent. Just want to get a sense of where you're getting to the point where you feel like you might have to start adding resources either sequentially or year-over-year? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Cindy? Cindy Cynthia Earhart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Sure, Chris. So if you looked at head count and said we were down about 300 year-over-year and down about 100 sequentially. We were hiring T&E in the third quarter. And we had actually increases in our T&E head count, but we were able to reduce the areas other than T&E to kind of keep that number down or relatively flat. Going into the fourth quarter, we expect to continue to be hiring some T&E, particularly in our main corridors, but we will also continue to try to manage the non-T&E head count. So you can expect to see it flat, maybe up slightly into the fourth quarter. And then into 2019, we'll talk a little bit more about that as our plans come together. Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Flat to up sequentially in 4Q. Just want to make sure I'm clear on that? Cindy Cynthia Earhart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yes. Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks for the time. I appreciate it. Operator : Our next question is from Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions. Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. So with regards to the new plan, have you started it now or is it something that you formulated and you plan on implementing and telling us about on February? Just trying to understand whether the results are something we can see on a continuous basis or is it something that kind of starts at a certain time in the future? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: We have begun implementing the Clean Sheeting part of the new operating plan. So yes, that has been underway for some time now. We've been going across the railroad from location to location Clean Sheeting as Mike has described. And we'll continue to push hard on that until we have laid the foundation through the Clean Sheeting process for a new operating plan for the network. Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: And part of prior plans at other railroads entailed a fairly significant head count reduction and quite a change in the infrastructure within each of the organizations and we've heard \u2013 you would have seen very significant reductions in number of hump yards and so on. Your approach in the past has been a little bit more balanced, I think you've termed it, Jim. Will this plan be more aggressive on head count reduction and infrastructure changes or continue to be more on the balanced site? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Labor productivity being a key component of overall productivity and a necessary component of further progress on the operating ratio, we will be focusing on that element of the plan. Certainly, as we grow out the new operating plan we would expect to achieve greater labor productivity as well as asset productivity through fewer locomotives and freight cars out on the network. Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: But is that incremental, or in prior plans we've seen 30% reductions in labor force. We've seen 75% reductions in number of hump yards. Improvement could be a little bit or a lot. I'm trying to get a sense of are we incremental improvement? Or is it along the lines of these other very significant changes in infrastructure and labor force? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: We'll give you more details in February. But as I have said, we do expect to put some aggressive ambitious goals out there for the operating ratio and for further overall financial improvement. Labor productivity and asset productivity, network productivity will be absolutely part of that and will be necessary to achieve those goals. Walter Spracklin - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your questions. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey, thanks. Morning, guys. Can you give us any sort of hurricane impact in the quarter and any sort of guidance on incentive comp year-over-year for the fourth quarter? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Okay, Mike, why don't you take hurricane question and then, Cindy, talk a little bit more about incentive compensation. Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yeah, we weathered the hurricanes really well. Hurricane Florence came on land and we were able to restore our main lines pretty quickly, within 24 hours. We did have some of water impact around New Bern that we had some of our bridges underwater, but we were able to use short lines to re-route traffic to some of our major customers. So Hurricane Florence was really a short-term impact to us. We got the railroad up very quickly. And same thing with Hurricane Michael, it moved across our network pretty quick. We were responding right behind it as it came in, pretty much removing trees and putting generators out at signals and grade crossings, and again, got the railroad up very quickly. So both storms that moved right through our network, we were able to recover quickly. And really that's a testament to our engineering folks who staged a lot of equipment, assets, generators out in the right locations so that we could recover quickly and we did. So we had very minimal impact and were able to get the railroad up very quickly. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Cindy? Cindy Cynthia Earhart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yes. In terms of the cost of the hurricane, I mean I think all of our preparation work really paid off. And the costs were really not significant at all in terms of the hurricane. On your second quarter around incentive comp, you'll recall and I said in my comments that third quarter of 2017, we had a large incentive comp adjustment. We did an adjustment in 2018 in the second quarter. Going into the fourth quarter, it will really depend on the company performance as to whether there's any sort of adjustment to incentive comp. So we'll just have to wait and see how we do as the fourth quarter continues. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : But nothing obvious on the year-over-year comp good or bad for 4Q, Cindy? Cindy Cynthia Earhart - Norfolk Southern Corp.: No, nothing. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And then, Jim, you mentioned that you've brought in some precision railroad in people. Can you maybe add a little bit more color there? Is it senior people? Is it people in the yards, just how many people? Just maybe a little bit more there would be helpful. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Well, we have people on the ground with PSR experience assisting us as we move through Clean Sheeting. We also have people who are advising us on the new plan as we put it together, the new operating plan, the new strategic plan, with that kind of a background. So we feel we have covered the bases and, as I said before, we know we don't have a monopoly on good ideas. We are open to best practices including but not limited to PSR. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : But are you sort of open to adding to the C-suite or executive levels if appropriate? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: I have total confidence in my team. And I believe that we have what we need in that team to deliver the results that we will lay out for you in February, just as we have delivered the results for you up to this point for the last three years. Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Thank you, guys. Appreciate the time. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions. Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, good morning, everyone. Alan, wanted to come to your revenue outlook because it looks like you have pretty bullish comments across your three segments here, merchandise, intermodal and coal. I just wonder if you could balance that in the context of the looming tariffs on a lot of Chinese goods that could be implemented in January. Have you have heard any concerns from your customer base around what's upcoming in 2019? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Brandon, what we're seeing is a little bit of inventory stockpile or inventory pull-ahead. However, you take a look at the macro data, the inventory sales ratio remains flat and at a pretty low level which indicates the demand for product is pretty strong. You take a look at manufacturing in September was up 5.1% year-over-year, the strongest gain in almost eight years. Retail sales in the third quarter were up 5.9%. So the economy remains very strong. The tariffs add some uncertainty to what our customers are thinking, however the underwriting economy as represented in the macro numbers is very strong, which gives us a lot of confidence in our volumes and our revenue in the fourth quarter and well into 2019. Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay I appreciate that, Alan. And then, Jim, maybe a little bit more strategic one. And I don't want to focus necessarily on your competitor. But if CSX were to run at a significantly lower operating ratio and we've seen them improve system velocity, and I know it's not defined the same anymore. But is that a concern for you if you can't get your cost base down equal to your competitor? Is there a lot of traffic that potentially could be at risk as you look out over the next couple of years? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Well, let me state what I think is the obvious. We are focused on enhancing value at Norfolk Southern, leveraging our franchise and we have for the last three years fulfilled our commitments to shareholders. Think about it, think back. Over 500 basis points improvement in the operating ratio in three years, double-digit EPS growth, ahead of schedule on both of those metrics, which we laid out three years ago, substantial shareholder value delivered. So we will continue to push for the best possible result at Norfolk Southern. We're very confident in our prospects and we'll give you the details on the new plan in February. Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, Jim. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Turan Quettawala with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your questions. Turan Quettawala - Scotiabank: Yes. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I guess just talking a little bit about PSR here. One of the other things that does happen is quite a bit of an improvement in CapEx. And you talk about obviously reducing cars online and so on and so forth. Should we assume just sort of directionally that CapEx should be going down here going forward or do you think it is sort of stays aligned little bit? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: We believe that 16% to 18% of revenue is an appropriate range for capital spending. We believe that's necessary in order to sustain our franchise and to invest for growth. In addition, we have significant expenditures now and on the horizon for locomotives. We're in the middle of a substantial locomotive conversion program and we intend to continue layering in new locomotive acquisitions as well. Turan Quettawala - Scotiabank: Okay. Thank you. And I guess just one more. I don't know if it's possible to give some early indications on coal here for next year just on the export side. Obviously, this year has been pretty strong on export coal. Just wondering do you think there's potential for further growth in the coal franchise in the export side next year? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Certainly, the seaborne prices have increased as the year has progressed. And if that holds into next year and coal production comes online, then, yes, we could see growth in our export coal franchise next year. Turan Quettawala - Scotiabank: Thank you very much. Operator : The next question is from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your questions. Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Yeah, good morning. We've seen some pretty credible press reports about you relocating your headquarters from Norfolk to Atlanta. This morning you just announced a February Investor Day to be held at Atlanta. I know this isn't a done deal, but can you talk high level. Is this synergy play just to get management closer to the operating team, a local talent pool play or really just more about cost reduction? And maybe just a little bit about the real estate situation that's creating this opportunity and whether or not you'd expect that to be net cash positive to your investors? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: We are considering headquarters relocation to Atlanta as has been reported in the press. It is not a done deal. A number of aspects of the relocation still have to come together for it to become a reality for us. The impetus for headquarters relocation is alignment and teamwork. It's our belief that we will function more effectively as a team, we will be more aligned if we are in one place. We do own property in Atlanta which we have been seeking to sell for some time now. And that would be one aspect of headquarters relocation that would need to be resolved before we do it. And we will certainly report to you as we report our results, any real estate gains that might accompany that transaction. Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your questions. Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah, good morning. So I wanted to ask you about I guess the broader review on the approach on PSR and so forth and the financial target. As you in February, as you think about that backdrop, how much does a review of probability of the segment play in? I think a component we've tended to see with PSR at other railroads is you look through the book and say, okay, maybe this is a piece of business we're not making a lot of money on. We can see some of it go away or we pretty significantly change the service that we offer. So I'm just wondering is that part of which are you doing here in PSR or the other strategic? Or you think the volume you have is good volume and you don't need to see some of it move away? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: What you have described, Tom, certainly is a part of the strategic review that we have underway. Now that's something that we do all the time. We're always looking at our book of business and seeking to optimize its profitability by one means or another. So that's ongoing. That's not necessarily new, but yes, at a high level, we are doing that as part of the new long-range plan. Alan? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Tom, you see us continue to take a look at our intermodal franchise. And we have announced some lane closures over the last year, year and a half, and yet still have shown eight straight quarters of volume improvement. Those actions and the productivity improvements that they generate as well as the pricing opportunity has really helped us improve the profitability of our intermodal franchise and allowed us to reinvest in it. As Jim noted, this is an ongoing effort across all of our business units. So it's nothing new, it's part of good housekeeping that we do every day. Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, good, that's helpful. And then maybe just one on the current dynamic in the truck market, how that affects you? I think, it's hard to tell, it seems like broader freight backdrop is pretty strong. That said, do you see evidence of softening in the truckload spot market, maybe not so much on the contract side. Have you seen some kind of wrinkles of weakness coming in? And how do you think about the kind of how tight things are and the outlook for pricing going forward? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Tom, our channel partners have indicated to us that they're expecting a very strong fourth quarter. And with consumer confidence being at an 18-year high, we expect that to continue well into 2019. Our contract structure will allow us to continue the momentum with pricing. So we're very confident about volume opportunities and pricing opportunities in the truck competitive environment for the remainder of this year and in next year. Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : Right. Okay. So you really haven't seen signs of weakness? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: No. Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thank you for the time. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your questions. Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Good morning. Jim or Mike, I guess, I just wanted to understand what changed through your process and maybe mindset here as you kind of step over to this Clean Sheeting PSR process. You've always talked about this is the right plan for you in terms of focusing on top line growth. And I guess maybe just to understand, is this kind of an evolution of that same plan? Or a complete overhaul and looking at your peers saying we need to shake that up? And I guess within that, Mike, I don't know if you want to maybe walk through the process of Clean Sheeting in terms of what you've been doing so far? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Well, Ken, let me respond first and then I'll turn it over to Mike. Certainly, we are looking to change the way we operate. That's necessary. The network has evolved over the years. It's time for a major network overhaul, an operating plan overhaul anyway. So that's something that we are focused on as a natural development in the life of the network, if you will. It's time for that kind of a bottom-up review of how we operate. So certainly the underpinnings of it are organic in that sense, driven by our customer base, our mode of operations up to this point, and the need to continue to push productivity and efficiency while preserving the capacity for growth. Mike, a little bit more about Clean Sheeting? Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yeah. This is evolutionary. As Jim noted, we've optimized our networks in the past and now we're going to take the next step and optimize them together. But Clean Sheeting is really a deep dive at our local serving yards and the nodes to that area. And we bring our service design folks in. We bring our customer service folks in. We bring marketing folks in. We look at all the local service schedules and we make sure they're synced up as good as they can with the main train network. We talk to customers about how we get traffic in and out of their facilities quicker, get them through our yards quicker. So it's a deep dive at all of these nodes across our network which are the local serving yards. And it's a pretty intense work that we do. We do it over several weeks and then we come out of there with a better, more efficient operating plan and you saw some of the results we showed you. Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So does it go so far as to just looking at improving the performance at those yards? Or does it step back in terms of the Clean Sheeting in terms of your network structure, right? So when you look at the peer now that's I guess ripping up the hub and spoke concept of intermodal. I know, Alan, you mentioned closing some lanes, but does it structurally change how you think about even the yards themselves? Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.: So what happens is after the Clean Sheeting is done then you're able to put the train plan network in a more optimal fashion where you get the benefits of what you've done with Clean Sheeting. Does that answer your question? Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah. No, appreciate the time. Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your questions. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning, guys. It'd be great to get a sense for \u2013 one of the tenets of your plan here is that you're going to be integrating some of the other segments into the merchandise network. I'm assuming you're talking about intermodal and merchandise. Exactly how separate have those networks been running to-date and can you give us some sense of how much of the networks are actually going to be integrated. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Mike, you want to take that one. Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yes. So our multilevel and intermodal networks have pretty much been integrated for several years. And Alan noted the productivity we've got out of those. So those have been integrated. Merchandise has been optimized and developed on its own. And then the bulk network's kind of been mainly its own separate network. So those are the three separate networks. We have done some integrating of different parts of that but not at the level that we're looking at for the next operating plan. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: And I guess as you start to think about putting the premium traffic in with some of the carload traffic, is that going to have an impact do you think on the services that you're actually able to offer to the marketplace as opposed to having one, two, three day a week service? Are you going to be able to offer a broader set of service as well as we move through the next couple of years? Michael Joseph Wheeler - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yes, absolutely. This is intended to make sure we actually provide more service to the customer. So yes, that's what we expect. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: The frequency of service certainly can increase under this new operating plan we believe. Our goal, as I said earlier, is to achieve this with a minimum of network disruption. That doesn't mean service won't change to some customers however. It will. It will. There will be different service parameters in some cases. Our goal is to provide a more consistent lower cost service product. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: I guess just within your markets, Jim, right obviously in the Eastern part of United States I would imagine that getting to a more frequencies on a day a week basis would give you a significant advantage relative to truck. Is that right? Or am I thinking about that wrong? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yes, that is true and that also can result in cost reduction because of the increased velocity of the network. J. David Scott Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Excellent. Thank you. Operator : Next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions. Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey good morning, thanks for taking the question. Maybe just go to Alan on domestic coal. You mentioned in the slides in the prepared remarks there was some increasing demand on utility coal. Could you give us a sense of where the stockpiles are, what the winter setup looks like from a network and equipment perspective? And then just any outlook with natural gas here, cracking above $3 for the first time in a long time? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Good morning, Brian. Stockpiles have largely declined over the last year. In the North they're at about 50 days. They've declined about 30 days in the last 12 months. And in the South, they're at about 65, 66 days and we estimate they've declined about 22 days within the last year. And so you see that setup for increase in demand for our services in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter of next year. Obviously with natural gas prices closer to $3.25 or $3.20 that helps too because, as you noted, that's up about $0.22 per million BTUs to where it was this time last year. Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, got it. And then on the export side, I know you gave some color on that already. But was there any impact from the hurricanes as they came through the network? I know you don't really have any storage capacity at Lamberts Point, but is there any sort of catch-up that you would expect to hit the fourth quarter? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: We had a force majeure within our coal fields for about three days earlier this month as a result of the hurricanes. And so you'll see a little bit of catch-up associated with that. We also did some maintenance at our Lamberts Point facility as well. So we fully expect that, assuming good production, that export volumes will ramp up sequentially week-over-week as the quarter progresses. Brian P. Ossenbeck - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks, Alan. Appreciate it. Operator : Our final question is from the line of Matt Reustle with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions. Matthew Reustle - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yeah. Thanks for taking my questions here. Just first on the PSR initiatives. Can you differentiate how much of this is an opportunity for you to just improve your own results, how well you run your business, versus how much of this is something that you need to do to bring down the cost structure to fend off competition as the trucking market eventually does recover and as your peer in the East has brought down its own cost structure? James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: We believe that by implementing best practices developed from within, developed with our customers in our consultative process, developed with our supply chain partners, and including our PSR practices can lead to both a better and more consistent service product and a lower cost structure. Matthew Reustle - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Okay. And then just quickly on crude, seeing a nice pick up there. Are most of those barrels coming in from Canada? Or are you seeing any split between the Canadian mix versus the Bakken mix and if you have contracts or you're part of the contracts tied to those barrels? Alan H. Shaw - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Yeah, Matt, most of our increase in crude oil volume is the Western Canadian select, which as I'm sure you're aware is very much in the money. There is a great arbitrage opportunity on the East Coast for that. So that's where we're seeing the volume growth. We expect it to continue in the fourth quarter and continue well into 2019. So we're optimistic about our volume outlook for the remainder of this year, whether it's in coal or intermodal or merchandise. And we expect that to continue in 2019 both for demand for our product and our ability to price. Matthew Reustle - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I'll turn the floor back to Jim Squires for his closing remarks. James A. Squires - Norfolk Southern Corp.: Thank you, everyone, for your questions today. We're excited about the momentum we have. We intend to deliver on our promises in the future as we have in the past. We look forward to announcing new financial targets at our Investor Day in February and to showing you the path we will take to get there. Thank you very much. Operator : This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Clay Moore, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Clay Moore : Thank you, Adam, and good afternoon. Before we begin, please note that during today's call we may make certain forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties and may differ materially from actual results. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. The slides of the presenters are available on our website at norfolksouthern.com in the Investors Section. Additionally, a transcript and downloads will be posted after the call. For comparative purposes the fourth quarter and full year 2017 results have been adjusted to exclude the re-measurement of deferred taxes due to the enactment of tax reform in 2017 and 2018 comparisons are to be adjusted 2017 results. Please refer to our non-GAAP reconciliation, which is also available on our website. Now, it is my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's Chairman, President and CEO, Jim Squires. Jim Squires : Good afternoon everyone and welcome to Norfolk Southern's fourth quarter 2018 earnings call. Joining me today are Alan Shaw, Chief Marketing Officer, Mike Wheeler, Chief Operating Officer, and Cindy Earhart, Chief Financial Officer. In the fourth quarter, we once again delivered strong financial results. Slide 4 highlights the results for the quarter and full year 2018, compared to the prior year. Income from operations was 1.1 billion, an increase of 27% and an all-time quarterly record. Net income was 702 million, up 44% over the prior year and EPS was 257, a 52% increase. The operating ratio for the quarter was 62.8. For the full year, we achieved record income from operations totaling nearly 4 billion, an increase of 17% from 2017. Net income increased 39% to 2.7 billion and earnings per share increased 44% to 951. The full year operating ratio of 65.4 was a record for our company and was our third consecutive year of OR improvement. In addition to lowering the OR and boosting earnings in 2018, we returned more than 3.6 billion to shareholder through share buybacks and dividends and our Board of Directors yesterday increased the quarterly dividend by another 8%. Looking ahead, we are determined to take Norfolk Southern to even greater heights. At our Investor Day, on February 11th, we will go over our new operational and financial targets and discuss in detail all of the initiatives with which we will drive shareholder value. Now to provide further details on our fourth quarter results, Alan will cover trends in revenue, Mike will cover operational performance, and Cindy will go over the financial results. I'll now turn the call over to Alan. Alan Shaw : Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon to everyone. As you can see on Slide 6, strength in all three business units drove the fourth quarter revenue increase of 9%. Each business unit posted a revenue per unit gain of 7%, reflecting both improved pricing and higher fuel surcharge revenue, as Norfolk Southern delivered fourth quarter year-over-year pricing increases that were the highest in over six years. Merchandise revenue grew 7%, generating a fourth-quarter revenue record on flat volume. As carload gains in chemicals and agriculture were offset by weakness in automotive and metals and construction. Our success in pursuit of pricing improvement, combined with higher fuel prices, resulted in a record merchandised revenue per unit. Norfolk Southern intermodal franchise once again delivered record-breaking revenue and volume results for the quarter. Our outstanding intermodal franchise, combined with tightness in the trucking sector and high levels of consumer spending, has generated three consecutive quarters of record intermodal volume. Intermodal revenue reached an all-time high in the quarter, reflecting a combination of improved volume, pricing strength and increased fuel surcharge revenue. Moving to coal, revenue increased 7% with a corresponding 7% increase in revenue per unit as a result of pricing gains in fuel surcharge revenue. Volume increased 1% as our utility franchise benefited from increased winter demand in high natural gas prices in the fourth quarter, while export volume was limited by coal availability. Moving to Slide 7. In 2018, Norfolk Southern achieved revenue growth in all three business units, including record revenue in both merchandise and intermodal, while handling record volumes. NS delivered 9% revenue growth in 2018, on top of 7% revenue growth in 2017, while improving the margins on our business through a combination of volume growth, pricing initiatives and efficiency improvements. Our year-over-year pricing was the highest in seven years, with strength in all business units. Throughout the year, the trucking industry experienced capacity constraints, and high truck rates, which supported strong growth in intermodal. In addition, consumer spending and industrial production both increased close to 4% in 2018, providing conditions that Norfolk Southern leveraged to drive merchandise growth. In the energy sector, increased demand for U.S. coals and favorable fuel price differentials led to revenue gains in export coal and crude oil, respectively. Overall, Norfolk Southern delivered strong top line results and improved margins in 2018, and we look forward to building on that momentum in 2019. I'm excited about our upcoming Investor Day, and sharing with you our outlook and plans for growth. I'll now turn it over to Mike for an update on operations. Mike Wheeler : Thank you, Alan. Today, I will update you on the state of railroad. 2018 was a year in which we handled record volume, record gross ton miles, and achieved a record operating ratio. Moving to our network metrics on Slide 9, we are pleased that the velocity of our railroad accelerated at the end of the fourth quarter and we drove further improvements in the first quarter of 2019. This has been achieved by the healthier T&E crude base, Clean Sheeting gaining further traction, the full implementation of our network operations center, and intense energy and execution by the field. We are operating from a position of strength as we go into the year and are laying a good foundation for our operating plan changes that you will hear more about in our investor day next month. Turning to some of our productivity initiatives on Slide 10, we are continuing to drive improvement in all areas. Record GTMs combined with our ongoing locomotive strategy resulted in record locomotive productivity for 2018. Beating the prior record set in 2017. We stored over 300 locomotives throughout the quarter and turned in 100 of our 180 leased locomotives. Fuel efficiency for 2018 tied our record performance from the previous year. Both of these measures have been driven by our improvements in train length, which was a quarterly record and for the full year. This is the third consecutive year we have either matched or exceeded record annual results for these key metrics. In closing, our full attention is looking forward. We are excited about the momentum we are delivering in operations and we expect our performance to continue to improve in 2018 and beyond. I will now turn it over to Cindy who will cover our financial achievements. Cindy Earhart : Thank you, Mike. Good afternoon everybody. We delivered another strong quarter and finished the year with record financial results. I'll start with fourth quarter summarize operating results on Slide 12, which as Clay mentioned earlier are compared to the adjusted 2017 results. As a reminder, 2017 results have also been recast to reflect the required reporting reclassification of certain pension and postretirement costs. As Alan discussed, our strong revenue growth has continued into the fourth quarter. The 9% increase in revenues when combined with the slight decrease in railway operating expenses resulted in all time quarterly record for income from railway operations of $1.1 billion, 27% higher than last year. We also achieved an operating ratio of 62.8 improving our last year's by 550 basis points. Let\u2019s take a look at the component changes in operating expenses in more detail on Slide 13. In total operating expenses were $4 million lower than last year\u2019s expenses. Gains in the sale of operating properties more than offset entire inflationary and volume-related increases. The material in another category decreased a 111 million or 66%. This quarter included a $145 million in gains on the sale of operating properties, as compared to approximately 25 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Property sales do fluctuate from quarter to quarter. The large sales in this quarter highlight our ongoing strategy to monetize assets that are no longer needed in our operations. The berries of this line item also included 20 million of rental income associated with operating property, which you will recall is now included in this expense category. This favorability was partially offset by higher casualty expenses, which were 9 million higher than fourth quarter 2017. We also incurred expenses associated with dispatched in our relocation which was completed in December. Compensation and benefits rose by 27 million or 4%. The largest driver of this change is related to increase pay rates of $30 million primarily due to negotiated rate increases for our union employees that occurred in the second half of the year. Incentive compensation expense was unfavorable by $12 million this quarter related solely to the timing of these accruals. As incentive compensation is about even for the year as compared to the amount earned in 2017. Overtime and recruits also added $11 million of costs this quarter. Consistent with our experience in prior quarters, health and welfare rates resulted in savings of approximately $9 million. Purchase services and rents increased $30 million or 7% compared to prior year results. This increase was primarily attributable to higher expenses associated with our volume related increase, higher technology cost and additional transportation and engineering activities. The remaining $8 million increase is related to higher equipment rent expense reflecting slower network velocity and the cost of additional short-term locomotive resources. As we mentioned last quarter, we expected equipment rents to drop sequentially in the fourth quarter and it did by $14 million. Fuel rose by 36 million primarily due to higher prices which added $29 million. Consumption was up 2% over the prior year and as Mike mentioned we held our fuel efficiency metric constant. Slide 14 shows a summary of our fourth quarter results. As you can see, other income earned for the quarter was fully offset by year-over-year negative returns on our corporate owned life insurance investments due to the decline in market performance experienced this quarter. Net income of $702 million was up 44% compared to last year's adjusted results, benefiting from our full year of the lower effective tax rate due to the enactment of tax reform. Diluted earnings per shares was $2.57, a 52% improvement over fourth quarter of 2017. Full year results are shown on Slide 15. We set company records in both income from railway operations and operations ratios. Income from railway operations of $4 billion was a 17% improvement over 2017. The full year operating ratio of 65.4 with a 270 basis points improvement as compared to last year's results and was a record full year alone. Slide 16 reflects our full year cash flow. Cash from operations totaled 3.7 billion, covering capital spending and generating a record 1.8 billion in free cash flow 16% higher than last year. We returned more than $3.6 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Our previously announced 1.2 billion accelerated share repurchase program was completed during the quarter, and we continued our ongoing open market purchases. Our share repurchases underscore our confidence in the business as we continue to drive growth and create shareholder value. As Jim noted, our board of directors remain committed to returning capital to shareholders and approved an increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.86 per share, reflecting an 8% increase over the previous quarter's dividend. This marks the third increase in our dividend over the past year. We continue to deliver improving financial results and are excited about the momentum we have to drive ongoing shareholder value into the future. Thanks for your attention and I'll turn the call back to Jim. Jim Squires : Thank you, Cindy. Three years ago, we announced a strategic plan aimed at delivering value to our shareholders through growth, productivity and bottom line improvement. Thanks to the hard work and dedication of our employees, we did just that. We lowered our operating ratio over 700 basis points, improved operating income by 39% and increased EPS 86% compared to three years ago. Building on these successes, we have been overhauling our operations from top to bottom in the quest for shareholder value. In short, we have been reimagining Norfolk Southern. At our Investor Day next month, we will discuss our new financial targets, the initiatives that will propel us into the future, and the metrics you will use to assess our progress. Today, our focus will be our fourth quarter and 2018 results. Thank you for your attention, and we will now open the line for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now be conducting our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Allison Landry from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live. Allison Landry : I realized that you plan to share a lot more detail in a couple of weeks, but wondering if you could speak broadly to when you think network fluidity will start to improve in the material way such that you can begin to eliminate the need for re-crews and additional locomotives and other added costs? Jim Squires : Good afternoon. Allison. We will go into a lot more details at investor day, not only about our new financial targets, but about the operating initiatives that will drive the financial results. And as I mentioned, we will also be introducing some new metrics with which to gauge your progress. Today, we are going to try to keep the focus on 2018. I do want to emphasize a couple of things that Mike pointed out in his portion of prepared remarks. We posted annual records and key productivity measures in 2018, locomotives efficiency and trend size for example. We stored more than 300 locomotives in the fourth quarter, and we returned 100 leased locomotives and that was while over the course of 2018, we handled a record volume and record gross ton miles. In the latter part of the fourth quarter, we achieved our highest monthly network velocity for 2018 and that was in December with service and velocity continuing to improve in first quarter. So the point is, we have a lot of momentum early in 2019 as we head into our new plan period. We've gained traction through Clean Sheeting and full implementation of our network operations center, and we're operating from a position of strength as we implement the new operating platform. Allison Landry : And maybe a question for the quarter, could you parse out the growth in domestic versus international intermodal? And maybe on the domestic side, I know you talked about tight capacity, but relative to Q3 or even if you went back a little further, has there been any change or sequential loosing in truck capacity because of lower spot rates? Alan Shaw : Good afternoon, Allison. Our international volumes were up 9%, and the fourth quarter and domestic volume was up 4%. And yes, we've seen some loosing and the truck market. I know the market still tight and we\u2019re encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing so far in bid season, and we are also encouraged by what we're hearing from our channel partners with respect to their outlook from both price and volumes as we move through 2019. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee from Citi. You are now live. Chris Wetherbee : Wanted to just sort of make sure I understood how you guys are viewing the 2018 performance to the 65.4% operating ratio obviously includes some gains and there is going to be gains and hopefully lost to a degree when you make transactions in the portfolio. So I get that, I just want to get a sense. Do you think sort of 65.4 is a good rate off of which sort of the future builds? Or maybe do we think about something that\u2019s adjusted extra of those gains? I just want to get a sense maybe how you guys think about the process? Jim Squires : Let me comment generally for us on how we view our 65.4 annual operating ratio for 2018 and then let Cindy address how we might want to think about that going forward. We started out three years ago with the goal of the sub 65 operating ratio by 2020, and here we are with the 65.4 operating ratio in 2018. So that represents excellent progress under our prior strategic plan and we made many other financial improvements along the way. So, we are pleased with our performance up to this point. We recognize that we have much more to do and that we are intent on continuing to drive financial results and shareholder value in the future and we have a lot, lot more to say about that at Investor Day. Cindy Earhart : Yes, Chris, I mentioned this in my comments we did have $145 million worth of gains of operating property this quarter which is high, I mean, compared to 25 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. We are going to continue to look at these assets and try to monetize them. It's very, very difficult as you know we're to be able to predict what quarter sales may come in. I certainly think that we got a very large gain in the fourth quarter around the property in Atlanta that\u2019s pretty unusual, but we are going to continue to sale property as we can. And it's going to continue to help from the operating ratio. Although, I'll say that going forward that we will continue to do that. The benefits in the operating ratio are really going to come from improved revenue and continue to push on productivity and that\u2019s what's going to drive our operating ratio long-term. Chris Wetherbee : And then just maybe, Alan, if I could switch gears onto the coal side just to get a sense, I know again trying to keep it relatively focused on the current period, but just sort of in context of what you are seeing in the market today. Maybe a comment on the utility side what you see from an inventory perspective in early '19 and then maybe some thoughts on the export side will be helpful? Alan Shaw : Yes, absolutely. On the utility front, stock piles have declined in the north and in the south by 17 days over the past year. And bulk of the some of our coproducing customers it's pretty clear that utilities are screaming for coal at this point and that\u2019s kind of the factor that we are seeing right now is limiting both volumes and the utility franchise and on the export side is coal availability, particularly thermal coal availability. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long from Stephens. You are now live. Justin Long : I wanted to ask about incremental margin, if we look at the gains on sale impact this quarter and what it was last quarter and back that out. I think you get to low 40s incremental margins, which I think is below what we have come to expect from a lot of the rails especially with some of the productivity initiatives in place. Could you give us some sense of the incremental margin you expect going forward? And what you view as a more normalized number? Jim Squires : Sure, again, let me address that generally and then I'll invite Cindy to add to my comments. I think, you think about incremental margin as being a reflection of the lower marginal cost of additional volume in part. Price -- the impact of pricing on the bottom line and productivity, those three key components, incremental margin will be a significant objective and output of the initiatives we undertaken all three areas in our new strategic plans. So recognizing the important the critical important of incremental margin that will certainly be a big part of the plan. Cindy Earhart : Justin, I would just say that, I think we said in the past the 50% incremental margin is kind of we talked about in the past it's going to vary from quarter-to-quarter. We did have in this quarter increased cost particularly in comp and benefits around incentive comp based on the business results that we have. So I mean I think that\u2019s a sort of way we think about it. Justin Long : And maybe for my second question, I know that you are going to get more details about the specific financial targets here at the Investor Day. But just bigger picture, as it relates to the OR performance, we heard from a variety of other class I rails that they want to lead the industry or be near the top of the fact. I know like I said, we\u2019re going to get the details today but just from a high level. Is there any reason why Norfolk can\u2019t progress from what is now the worst OR in the industry to something that's at least in the middle of the pack? Just curious how you're thinking about the OR performance relative to the rest of the industry? Jim Squires : We will do what we need to create shareholder value adjustment and so, we understand the importance of operating ratio, and that is certainly front and center as we think about the future. So, we\u2019re going to continue to push on operating ratio. We will get there, as well as operating income and other key financial metrics. We will get through a combination of growth and efficiency. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra from Deutsche Bank. You are now live. Amit Mehrotra : If we take out the 145 million non-cash gain in the quarter, the core operating ratio is more like 67.8%, unless I calculated something incorrectly, that\u2019s an improvement year-over-year but not nearly that impressive in the context of best pricing environment in seven years, which I think was a comment that was earlier made. So, and also obviously still far away from your peers, so what are the issues, I guess, either from a cost or volume side that maybe is not allowing you to make that type of progress of the profitability side in the context of pricing? And I guess maybe you can address in this answer the fact that you have CSX out there that is in a much better proper position and has taken out significant cost and may be in a position to drive a little bit of market share shift. Jim Squires : I think if you step back, we have produced over 700 basis points operating improvement, operating ratio improvement under our all strategic plan. We've made significant progress on operating ratio and that\u2019s been accompanied by very strong earnings growth and shareholder returns as well. We've taken that the cash that we have generated. We have reinvested it in our company and we have returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchase. So, it\u2019s been a strong performance for the last three years. Now, we've recognized that we have more room to increase shareholder value and that's obviously our objective in the new plan. So, we\u2019re going to continue to push operating ratio is front and center as I mentioned, and we will pull out all the staffs to generate shareholder value in the coming years. Amit Mehrotra : Just one follow-up if I could on the balance sheet, really on the cash flow side. You know every rail now I mean, UMP just brought their number down to 13.5% of sales in terms of their CapEx. CSX has been there, I think you guys are still up in that kind of much higher level is CapEx and leverage levels really CapEx. Is their ability to bring down CapEx towards where the rest of the industry is part of this evaluation? Just any update or thought there as you guys look at that. Jim Squires : The level of CapEx going forward will obviously be depended on the return that the capital spend it can generate. In our view, 16% to 18% of revenue has been a solid range, that\u2019s what we have been doing for the last several years, and likely we will continue to. Again depending on the returns, we believe that that level of capital spending we can generate excellent shareholder returns. Amit Mehrotra : So, 16% to 17% for the next several years is that going to be updated in February? Jim Squires : Look, we will talk more about that at Investor Day for sure, but we previously said that we believe 16% to 18% is an appropriate zone for capital spending because it can drive the shareholder returns that we are trying to drive. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz from UBS. You are now live. Tom Wadewitz : I wanted to get thoughts on the -- you talked about Clean Sheeting. You've identified some of the metrics that saw some benefits from that and in terms of some of the productivity metrics. Just wondering, if you could give us a sense of where you're at in that process, I know that focused on I guess the local yards. So that I'm sure there is a lot more to go to that you will talk about in February, but maybe just some thoughts on where you are at in the work on the local yards in the Clean Sheeting process? Jim Squires : Okay and we will talk a lot more about that in a few weeks, but let me turn it over to Mike for some thoughts on what we're doing right now. Mike Wheeler : Yes, so the initial phase of the Clean Sheeting process is going to be completed essentially crossed the railroad, early summer, and it is going very well. We are really pleased with that's why we are really focusing a lot on it. But the idea of using good industrial engineering practices to look the way we do business in our local serving yards and really any of our yards is going to turn the way we are going to do business the NS way in the future. But once we get the Clean Sheeting initially done, we will be rolling out the new operating plan on top of that in midsummer as well. But I'll tell you, we are taking the opportunities we see now when we see an operating plan change that that works now we are going to hit and implementing it. But Clean Sheeting will be done by midsummer and then we will be implementing the new operating plan then. Tom Wadewitz : And then, a question for you on the export coal side or maybe on the broader coal side, Alan, you mentioned that supply issues are constraint. Is that a temporary constraint? Is that just kind of near-term issues at existing mines? Or is that something where you said that\u2019s just kind of tapped out where they are running and you would have to bring new mines online in order to produce more coal? Alan Shaw : Tom, good question and thank you for allowing me to clarify that, that is -- our perception is a temporary constraint from speaking with our partners on the production side, something that we feel like is going to cycle off by the end of the first quarter. There is very strong demand out there both overseas and domestically. Tom Wadewitz : So, you could see tonnage growth given the market but just probably not in first quarter given the mine constraints. Alan Shaw : Yes, the production is going to be a limiting factor here in the near term. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley. You are now live. Ravi Shanker : Just to clarify on the Clean Sheeting, did you say that you're working on the plan just now and will be implemented over the summer? I just want to check if you have already started implementing certain actions and if there are any cost drags in the fourth quarter as result of that? Jim Squires : We have been implementing Clean Sheeting for some time now, in fact, for much of 2018, we were Clean Sheeting the railroad, and we are making some changes in the operating plan even as we speak with more of that to come in 2019. Ravi Shanker : Are there any pretty growth cost items you would like to point out as being the drag to railroad? Jim Squires : No not as a result of Clean Sheeting or implementation of the high velocity plan. Ravi Shanker : And just as follow-up, I mean, just given the pricing environment that you mentioned. Just going ahead in 2019 and the potential loosening of truck markets and maybe a broader macro slowdown, can you just clarify your broader strategies and pricing going forward? Are you happy to push for more pricing gain even if that means a loss of volumes and shippers switching from rail to truck? Jim Squires : Ravi, our strategy to when it drives shareholder return and this is a great environment to push our price. We\u2019re going through bid season right now in the air model network, and we\u2019re seeing continued strength there. So, I\u2019m very confident in our ability to continue to price through 2019. We've talked about that basically for the past year that 2019 was lining up to be a strong pricing year, and we still see that and we're expecting the momentum that we created and 2018 to carry over into 2019. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt Reustle from Goldman Sachs. You are now live. Matt Reustle : Back to the intermodal business, you did see deceleration in volume and pricing in the fourth quarter. It sounds like the environment is still strong. Is that purely a case of lapping tough comps? Is there anything else there in terms of competition picking up, loosing truck market that\u2019s driving that deceleration? Jim Squires : We actually saw an acceleration of pricing in the fourth quarter, Matt. And I will point you back to the fact to your point that fourth quarter 2017 at the time was a record volume and a record revenue quarter for us in inner model. We go a great intermodal franchise, we got the best intermodal franchise in the east and then there is great opportunity for highway to real convergence going forward. Matt Reustle : Yes, I\u2019m looking at RPU on ex fuel basis and it looks like 3Q to 4Q that came down a bit, but understood. Jim Squires : We've talked about a shift, international intermodal grew 9%. Domestic intermodal grew 4% in the quarter. So, that's a negative mix was in intermodal. We had a great pricing quarter and fourth quarter and intermodal and expect that to continue and based on what we\u2019re seeing so far with bid season, we\u2019re very confident it will. Matt Reustle : And just more philosophical question looking back at 2018, you've mentioned a couple of times. You're coming off a year where operating income is up in the high-teens. It's at the high end of the peer group. You've shown all our improvement. So, when you look at 2018 results, what drives the need to shift to a new operating plan? What is it that stands out that was disappointing, which requires a whole new operating strategy versus progress that you've been making over the past couple of years? Jim Squires : Financial results were good. Network performance and customer service were not what they should have been in 2018. And so, it\u2019s a push to achieve higher levels of network performance customer service and greater efficiency as well. Of course that has us taking another look at the operating plan. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. You are now live. Brandon Oglenski : Jim, I get it that you guys had the rental gains and we include those for other carriers too, but it was pretty chunky. I guess just want to circle back because the OR is trailing your peers now. I mean, is there a sense of urgency inside the organization that says, clearly, there is an operating model that can drive well cosmic system better service. How are guys incentivizing I guess the organization to go and achieve these goals? Jim Squires : Sure, absolutely, there is a lot of urgency around here and a lot of enthusiasm, energy and excitement about this new mode of operations we are adopting based on precision schedule railroad. So, we talked about that on the third quarter call about the people that we have brought into the organization to help us drive PSR preferences and it's working. You see it in the surface metrics thus far in the first quarter in the latter part of the fourth quarter as well. So, it's clearly taking hold. We feel like there's a lot of momentum, and yes, there is a great deal of urgency here about the new plan. We will talk a lot more about that at Investor Day. Brandon Oglenski : And I get that, you want to save a lot of discussion for Atlanta, but the headcount line, we saw headcount move up a little bit in the fourth quarter and I think the key tenant when we have seen these PSR implementations work is very rapid reduction in employee counts because productivity gets that much better. So, how do we think about just in the context of heading into '19, the movement between volume and the network and headcount and the ability to drive incremental labor productivity? Jim Squires : Significant improvement in operating ratio, which is our goal will be premised on a combination of growth and productivity. Productivity in turn is a function of better efficiency with respect to labor, locomotives, fuel and our other resources in the business. So, that's the foundational, all of that is the foundation of our new strategic plan, and we will get into a lot more detail on those things in February. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin from RBC Capital Markets. You are now live. Walter Spracklin : Just going back on your characterization, I'm little surprised by Jim you characterization of your operating ratio given how significant the gains were. I'm just curious whether there -- how much gain was predicated in the sub 65 OR that you had anticipated compared to what actually came to play? And should we bank on continued gains to this level over the next few years? Or maybe some guidance around what gains, what level of gains you expect? Jim Squires : Walter, I can't give you good guidance on real estate gains, except to say that they will occur from time to time and in some quarters they will be significant as they were in the fourth quarter. Monetizing real estate and all underutilized property is part of our strategy. And that results in better results for shareholders. That will not be the driver of our success as a company going forward. What will make a difference for shareholders and will drive shareholder value will be railroad operations, pricing, and growth and so that will be the focus from time to time, there will be significant gains and I'm sure enough they were in the fourth quarter. Walter Spracklin : So, you did compare your quarter 2 to sub 65, so you did obviously have an assumption for gains for that sub 65 level. How do they compared to what you're realizing the share? Jim Squires : We no longer want the real estate gains would occur from time to time. It's very difficult to predict when you will book the more significant gains, but certainly that\u2019s part of the strategy part of the plan and we saw lot of them. Walter Spracklin : Just on call, you've done a good job just to kind of characterizing a quarter-to-quarter expectation for how your domestic volumes would come in. Any -- I know, it's uncertain, obviously, but any move toward giving contextualizing the sequential quarter going forward with of course domestic utility call. Jim Squires : We will talk more about the 11 demand is strong, stockpiles have declined, and customers are searching for coals. So depended upon availability of thermal coal could be a pretty strong quarter. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl from Cowen and Company. You are now live. Adam Kramer : This is Adam for Jason. I guess just a couple quick questions on precision schedule railroading and Clean Sheeting. First in terms of Clean Sheeting, how many relocations were you guys able to attack in the fourth quarter and go after with the Clean Sheeting process? Mike Wheeler : Well, we ramped it up in the fourth quarter as we plan to do because we are excited about what work results were getting out of it and we even ramped it up a little bit more going into this year to get it done early into the summer. So we\u2019re moving ahead of pace on what we wanted to get done and Clean Sheeting, but I will tell you in addition to putting teams out there that were doing Clean Sheeting from location to location, we've embedded people into the field to just make this the part of the way of life at NS. So while we\u2019re while Clean Sheeting across the railroad, we\u2019re also building it just the daily operating practices at the railroad. So early summer when this things all done, we will be ready to go with our new operating plan. Jason Seidl : And I guess quick follow-up as well. You guys cited the customer service was kind of one of the drivers here for improvements what you're looking to do. I guess maybe little bit on your conversations with shippers and with your customers concerning PSR. What have those been like? What are the back and forth spin? What have shippers been telling you guys about PSR? And the data effects that you had on them either positive or negative? Jim Squires : Ours has been and we will continue to be a consultative approach. We\u2019re working with our customers as we overhaul our network. Let me turn over to Alan to talk a little bit about the dialog with customers as we go through Clean Sheeting. Alan Shaw : Absolutely, our approach with our customers has been highly collaborative. They want us to succeed and they want a supply chain partners that can support their growth and so their goals are aligned with ours, we\u2019re focused on improving service and also putting a product out there that lets them compete and we\u2019re seeing that, we got 9% growth in 2018 on top of 7% growth in 2017 and we\u2019re very excited about the growth opportunities that we see in 2019 Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck from JP Morgan. You are now live. Brian Ossenbeck : So, Mike, just going back to some of the performance in the quarter, and I'll get few more metrics in the next couple of weeks. But last call, you mentioned that network velocity measured at the car level. That was near the highest for the year and crew productivity was also strong. So I was hoping you could give us an update as to where those metrics were in the fourth quarter? And did they also improve through the middle of January? Jim Squires : The answer is yes. They continued to improve. We saw our terminal really get fluid into the third quarter going into the fourth quarter and that's where I was referring to that was getting the cars through the terminals. And then at the end of the fourth quarter our main lines really became fluid. So yes, and it's continued on even into the first quarter so both of those are doing well going forward so pretty excited. Brian Ossenbeck : Jim, obviously, there is some more tariffs and credits going into effect in the network next month and these have obviously been used to incentivize compliance with service design changes at the aspects of PSR at different networks. But with the STB is trying to look at these demurrage and accessorial fees, do you think that approach has to change this time around? Appreciate some context in terms of interaction with the regulators some of the shipper response to these items and how you might plan utilizing in the future? Jim Squires : I'll ask Alan to talk about the specifics of our demurrage changes, but let me say that we are in regular dialogue with our regulators, including the STB. As you know, Chairman, [indiscernible] send a letter to all the Class 1 about changes in demurrage programs to which we responded we will continue to keep up that dialogue that open relationship with our regulators. Alan, some more specifics on our changes in assessorial. Alan Shaw : Brian, our assessorial program is designed to align our interests and our customers' interest with our mutual benefit, and really complements the efforts of our operating department to improve our service and efficiency. And we are delivering that. As Mike has said and you can see in the public metrics, our train speed is improving our dwell is declining and customers are seeing improvements in our service. That\u2019s ultimately what they're looking for. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors from Susquehanna. You are now live. Bascome Majors : As we look into the first part of next year and I realized the meet of the guidance is going to come in couple of weeks here, but other than the gain and maybe some elevated incentive comp expense. Is there anything abnormal about the fourth quarter results when we think about what they mean in a run rate or seasonal basis going forward? Jim Squires : Cindy went through the particulars in the expense lines and flagged the things that stood out in the fourth quarter. Cindy, other things that\u2026 Cindy Earhart : No, I would just say that and you'll notice in my comments. I did talk about we still have some additional cost associated with re-crews in overtime and some equipment rails associated with the some of our network velocity. So they were some of those, but nothing else. Bascome Majors : And with the headquarters move, from economic perspective, should we expect anything lumpy over the next couple years, be it in labor with packages for people who don't decide to relocate or rent additions for new facilities or capital cost? Just anything financially from that course may that can move the needle on enterprise basis? Jim Squires : We will begin relocating employees in 2019 in the middle of the year and we will relocate the majority of the employees in 2021. Tallying up all the costs associated with those moves we would not expect them to be material over that period of time. So the purpose of the headquarters relocation I might add is closer alignment and we\u2019re excited about that we think that having all of our folks in one head quarters building will be a very good thing. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter from Merrill Lynch. You are now live. Ken Hoexter : Cindy, you've noted the incentive comp boosted salaries and benefits. Do you include the gains in that to get to your -- or to you OR target, are the gain included to get to that incentive comp? And then, were there any other real estate gains throughout this year or only in the fourth quarter? Cindy Earhart : In terms of the gain on the sales of operating property, as you know, Ken as to operating income and operating ratio, those are two key components of our incentive comp. So, it did add to incentive comp. We obviously have had property sales this year throughout the year and not to the extent of the fourth quarter and we had obviously improved the issues as well. So it does add, it does add to the incentive comp. Jim Squires : Ken, as Cindy mentioned, incentive compensation for the full year 2018 was roughly comparable to 2017. Ken Hoexter : No, I asked it because if I look at the largest for year gains for CP was 95 million CFX with 140 million. So your one quarter here was bigger than full year that both those companies included. So, is there -- you've mentioned there were others earlier in the year, but I don\u2019t think they got called out. Can you give us the total for what they were for the quarters? Cindy Earhart : Yes, so Ken, in total, they were probably 10 million to 15 million for the three quarters. Ken Hoexter : And then I guess Mike, if we can just on your KPIs that you talked about. Jim noted you take out locomotives and I presume that accelerating as your performance improves. So you plan to improve that, but your gross tons miles for locomotive chart that you had there was flat year-over-year. Just wondering as you step back and think about that given the Clean Sheeting, is that something we should have see improvements that we should going forward see improvement? I guess is that something you focus on with whether it's train length growing our or improve sidings how you think about that that metric? Jim Squires : Yes, it is absolutely one of our KPIs now and going forward. But if you look at the fourth quarter, you'll see that in December it really changed there was a big step function up in the quarter. So, we took the locomotives out near the end of the quarter, we\u2019ve continue to take locomotives out even into this year. So absolutely train links, train weight are all part of the operating plan changes were put in place and again were not waiting when we see opportunities were take advantage of it . But the more holistic operating plan will be the next quarter or two. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group from Wolfe Research. You are now live. Scott Group : So, a couple of things for you Cindy, can you give us any guidance on other income going forward? Can you give us some thoughts on how much of an increase we should expect in accessorial revenue? And I guess since you don't report other revenue, will that be just put in revenue per car? So, two questions, and then I guess maybe just a comment Cindy like in the future if we ever not some made really big gains just in the 8-K like let us know about in advance would be helpful? Cindy Earhart : Scott, in terms of other than that I think the run rate perspective, we would say that probably about 80 million annually is the good run rate for that. In terms of the accessorial, you are right. I don\u2019t know that we are expecting there to be big changes in that and it just becomes part of the normal revenue car. So, does that answer your question? Scott Group : Yes, I guess why wouldn\u2019t there be big changes like we saw pretty meaningful increase in that other revenue for CFX series, they made changes? Are your changes different than what they did? Jim Squires : Not with our. Alan Shaw : Scott, our changes are designed to improve our efficiency and our network velocity. So, we are not counting on additional revenue with these. What we're doing is we are collaborating with our customers on our service changers they are being brought in on the front end of this because we want to make this smooth for them and smooth for us. They can help us, we can help them and we can both grow together that\u2019s the overall intent. Scott Group : And are you seeing compliance with it right away? Alan Shaw : Yes, you can see improvements as Mike talked about we are in storing locomotives at the end of December while volumes were accelerating and our change people is improving. Mike Wheeler : Scott, the customers are really engaged in this and they want, as Alan noted, they want to see it see us and this process succeed. Alan Shaw : And we've gotten off Scott to a very strong start to start January in terms of both volume and service product. Now, the storms in the Northeast have had an impact on our volumes and our velocity so far this week, but we are very confident in the product that we are delivering and the demand out there for our product. Scott Group : I know we are going to get long-term sort of labor productivity headcount guidance in the interim, can you just give us some guidance on 1Q for headcount? Jim Squires : I think if you can hold for just a couple of more weeks, Scott, we will give you as much forward-looking guidance as possible. I know that\u2019s obviously going to be a big focus of investor day to give you the longer term and shorter term in some cases shorter term financial goals and the resource components thereof. Scott Group : I know I'm going over but just to help us get ready for next kind of month. Should we be thinking five year targets, three year targets, I just want to get prepared? Jim Squires : We will get into the plan period, duration of the new plan period in February along with everything else. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Vernon from Bernstein. You are now live. David Vernon : Alan, when you look at the intermodal per unit for the revenue bringing for intermodal, up 7 with fuel up 4 without fuel coming off sort of mid teens increase in truck rates. Should we be expecting that numbers to creep up a little bit is a lag effect sort of kind comes into the business? Or is that a good kind of 15, get to your 7 kind of ratio thinking about for the pricing leverage you guys can take out of the truck rate, inflationary that\u2019s happening in the market? Jim Squires : David, we as I said our pricing improved throughout the year, which was very good about where we\u2019re headed as we move into 2019. Bid season has started for us pretty well and the feedback that we're getting from our channel partners is there is continued strength and intermodal pricing. We\u2019re seeing strength there as you know our RPU was up 7% in every single one of our business units. It has to go back seven years to find that. So, we're very confident in our pricing strategy and our approach, it will continue into 2019. David Vernon : Is it reasonable to think that it could approach those sort of levels that you saw in truckers? Or is that going to be -- is that just kind happening too much? Jim Squires : We\u2019re going to push it as hard as we can and you saw that this year. We delivered 18% revenue growth in our intermodal franchise and 2018 on top of 11% growth in 2017, while improving margins, that is exactly what we need to do. David Vernon : Thank you that\u2019s helpful. And then Cindy, just to clarify before, I think you said other net should be about 80. Is that inclusive of the reclassification of the some of the rental income of above the line or because I\u2019m just trying to reconcile the zero and 4Q this year to a expecting like an 80 for the full year of 19 on that other net line? Cindy Earhart : Yes, the 80 is we would expect for an annual run rate. I have mentioned in my comments in the fourth quarter, we had about $25 million decrease year-over-year in returns on a company or life insurance. So, that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing in the fourth quarter. That was pretty unusual. It was tied very much just market performance in the fourth quarter. David Vernon : Okay and then just in that other offset to the other line that moved above the line. I\u2019m assuming the coal royalty to be included in that. Can you give us any sense for how much of an increase you got into fourth quarter this year on that number? Cindy Earhart : Yes, it's not significant Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have no further questions in queue at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Jim Squires for closing comments. Jim Squires : Thank you. We are proud of what we've accomplished and are excited about our prospects for future success. In a few weeks, we will discuss the strategic initiatives we have underway which will further strengthen our company deliver even more value to our shareholders, and we look forward to discussing them with you at our investor day on February 11th. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude our teleconference for today. You may now disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to introduce Pete Sharbel, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Sharbel, you may begin. Peter Sharbel : Thank you, Rob. And good morning. Before we begin, please note that during today's call, we may make certain forward looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, and may differ materially from actual results. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. The slides of the presenters are available on our website at norfolksouthern.com in the investor section, along with our Non-GAAP reconciliation. Additionally, a transcript and downloads will be posted after the call. Now it is my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's Chairman, President and CEO, Jim Squires. Jim Squires : Good morning, everyone and welcome to Norfolk Southern's first quarter 2019 earnings call. Joining me today are Alan Shaw, Chief Marketing Officer; Mike Wheeler, Chief Operating Officer; and Cindy Earhart, Chief Financial Officer. At our recent Investor Day in Atlanta, we described our team's commitment to reimagining possible for Norfolk Southern, that commitment is unwavering. We are finding that the more we adopt new practices and ideas, the more we can drive bottom line growth and shareholder value. The results showed in the first quarter, as indicated on slide four, income from operations was $966 million, an increase of 16%. Net income was $677 million, up 23% over the prior year and EPS was $2.51, a 30% increase. The operating ratio improved 330 basis points versus last year to 66%. All of these figures were first quarter records. Underlying the financial achievements were dramatic improvements in network performance. Key service and productivity measures also moved in the right direction. The stage is now set for implementation of our new operating plan, Top 21, which will drive further operational, service and financial progress. Now to provide details on our first quarter results, Alan will cover revenue, Mike will cover operations and Cindy will go over the financial results. I'll now turn the call over to Alan. Alan Shaw : Thank you, Jim and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to discuss our first quarter results that demonstrate our ongoing progress in driving top line growth and margin expansion, enhanced by the initiatives introduced at our February Investor Day. Our results highlight our yield up strategy with a focus on testing the limits of market based pricing, reflecting the value of our network and product, allocating resources to opportunities with the greatest return and reducing network complexity to develop a valued service product we execute every day. Our continued emphasis on collaboration between Norfolk Southern and our customers strengthened our ability to deliver pricing increases and service improvement, resulting in solid revenue growth. As Mike will discuss in a few minutes, our customer facing metrics are trending in a positive direction. As we continue improving our service product, we are effectively aligning with our customers for our mutual goals of more reliable and frequent service with better velocity. This provides both Norfolk Southern and our customers with a platform for growth, while we both compete in an evolving marketplace. Our initiatives are delivering results. Slide six highlights our first quarter year-over-year growth of 5%, the ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue gains and a record for first quarter revenue. Strong pricing in all business groups and higher fuel surcharge revenue improved revenue per unit by 4%. Our pricing success increased merchandise revenues 5% year-over-year, despite a 1% decline in volume in the first quarter. Strong service levels and demand increased corn and feed volumes. This is offset by decreases in our automotive business impacted by declines in U.S. light vehicle production and railcar availability due to disruptions across the U.S. multi-level network. Our intermodal franchise continues to thrive, with first quarter revenues increasing 6% year-over-year on a 2% volume gain. In particular, international growth is up significantly due to a rise in import volumes as a result of tariff uncertainty. These gains were partially offset by declines in domestic shipments that face difficult comparisons to double-digit growth last year, and were negatively impacted by winter weather and lane rationalizations as part of our strategic initiatives to yield up and optimize our network. In our coal franchise, our efforts to realize the value of our service product through pricing resulted in a 6% improvement in revenue per unit, maintaining revenue of $435 million, despite a 5% reduction in volume. First quarter volumes declined in the export market due to decreases in metallurgical coal availability and weaker thermal seaborne pricing. Utility volume was relatively flat as gains from improved network velocity were offset by planned outages and inclement weather. All business groups posted significant gains in revenue per unit with merchandise and intermodal delivering records in revenue per unit less fuel. Our yield up initiatives generated strong pricing in the quarter, and we are committed to leveraging our long standing customer relationships and our improving service product to ensure we deliver value to our shareholders. These gains mark nine consecutive quarters of year-over-year total RPU growth despite the negative mix associated with continued strong growth in our intermodal franchise. Assessorial charges increased during the quarter. As we stated, our intent is to align our assessorial program with the mutual goals of Norfolk Southern and our customers to turn equipment faster, increasing network fluidity and velocity and improving our service product, while creating a capacity dividend that facilitates growth, both for Norfolk Southern and our customers. These efforts, along with other strategic initiatives have improved our service product and reduced cars online. In the first quarter, we saw some customers turning back leased equipment, while continuing to grow on Norfolk Southern. We are achieving better operate in alignment between our customers and Norfolk Southern, generating capacity in the process. Moving to slide seven, our customers are optimistic about growth and the economic outlook remains positive. With consumer spending rebounding in March, consumer sentiment at elevated levels, manufacturing still in expansion mode and jobless claims at the lowest level in 50 years. The truck market remains tight by historical standards, although certainly not as tight as last year and continues to benefit our intermodal and merchandise businesses. We expect our merchandise volumes for the remainder of the year to be relatively flat compared to 2018. Forecasts for manufacturing and consumption are positive, with increased demand expected for most of our customers. However, pipeline activity is expected to negatively impact demand for NGLs and limit overall volume growth. Intermodal is expected to continue with growth trend, albeit at a slower pace than in 2018. Improved service levels, continued relative tightness in the trucking industry and forecasted growth in consumer spending will drive demand for domestic shipments, while our franchise strength will continue to improve international volume. Overall coal volumes are expected to be down in 2019, utility demand continues to be impacted by lower natural gas prices. Export is expected to decline in the second quarter due to lower API II pricing, supply issues at select mines and difficult year-over-year comparisons related to high mine inventories during the same period last year. We anticipate sustained pricing growth throughout 2019 across our merchandise and intermodal business groups. Coal pricing will be influenced by the seaborne market, continued improvement in our service product and collaboration with our customers will enhance our pricing and yield up initiatives as we work to fully leverage the value of our product. In summary, our focus on yielding up to drive revenue and margin growth supported by our improving service product delivered strong top line results in the first quarter. We're on the right path and will continue working to achieve the objectives we outlined at our Investor Day. We look forward to a strong year for both Norfolk Southern and our customers, as we work together with common goals to be more efficient and meet the market demand. I will now turn it over to Mike for an update on operations. Mike Wheeler : Thank you, Alan. Today, I will update you on the state of railroad and the status of our Top 21 operating plan. First quarter 2019 was a quarter in which we drove significant service improvements for our customers and achieved a record first quarter operating ratio. Moving to slide nine, our focus on strengthening our network is evident in our performance metrics in the first quarter as well as the positive feedback we received from our customers. And we are sustaining the performance and driving further improvement in the second quarter, specifically our terminal dwell for the week ending April 12th was the lowest on record. We are also pleased with the resiliency and how well we bounce back quickly from February's polar vortex and winter weather. This operational performance has been achieved by the earlier than anticipated completion of our initial round of clean sheeting and through implementing 60 mile an hour speeds for non-intermodal trains on primary routes. We have established an excellent foundation for our new Top 21 operating plan that will be fully implemented by the end of July. Turning to our service and productivity metrics on slide 10, which we presented at our Investor Day in February, these metrics are align with our new strategic plant, which is built upon our implementation of key PSR principals and providing a service product that will allow us to continue to grow. The blue bars represent our respective goals for 2019, which I will speak to regarding our progress. Starting with the service delivery index, which is the on-time delivery performance of our scheduled shipments index to 2018. This is a customer facing metric, which combines shipment consistency which is a measure of plant adherence for general merchandise and automotive traffic along with intermodal availability. Due to our improved execution we are on track to meet our goal for 2019 as we are delivering significantly more shipments on-time to our customers. And I personally met with many customers who are confirming the improvements we are seeing in this metric. We are on track to meet the T&A productivity goal for this year. Throughout the first quarter we were able to reduce T&A headcount as a result of improved velocity and fewer re-crews, a trend that will continue for the rest of the year as we fully implement our Top 21 plan and on-board fewer conductor trainees. Now we are currently flat on train weight, it is been driven by reduced train lengths during the polar vortex and our initiative to speed up the coal network by running shorter faster trains. We are confident we will achieve this goal for this year as our new Top 21 plan will reduce train miles and security. The plan also creates heavier trains. We are tracking ahead of our locomotive productivity goal for this year as we aggressively store the older less reliable locomotives and returned least locomotives. Lastly, our velocity improvements increased service frequency to our customers and aggressively scrapping older lower capacity cars have allowed us to accelerate our progress on reducing cars online and exceeding our goal. Not only has this freed up capacity that can be used for growth it also allows our customers to reduce assets in their fleet, which will continue to reduce cars online overall. Additionally as you may recall this number includes cars in storage, which is approximately 11,000. They are however available to our customers as we look to continue to grow with them. All of these initiatives contribute to the capacity dividend we spoke to at Investor Day. I would also like to update you on the progress of our new Top 21 operating plan on slide 11, which is well underway. As you may recall from our Investor Day, our new operating plan will have four major objectives. Operators one network, a balanced train plan between terminals, serve our customers frequently and reduce dependence on major terminals. We have already implemented some of our operating plan changes. These targeted implementations of train plan changes are before we rollout the full Top 21 operating plan. This year's iteration of Top 21 is focused on our general merchandise, unit train and automotive business. Future iterations will focus on intermodal. Two key pillars of the new operating plan will be expanding the use of distributed power, which utilizes locomotives on the head and middle of the train, as well as driving more unit train business to manifest, which we have already implemented some targeted conversions similar to the cold riding the intermodal train 23-G, which we showed you at Investor Day. We also have converted some coke business coming out of the Central App coal fields going to the North, as well as some stone and ethanol business in the South, just to name a few. As previously mentioned, increasing the merchandise train speeds from 50 mile an hour to 60 mile an hour, which is the speed intermodal trains currently operate at allow us to continue to commingle networks. These routes are shown on the map. Additionally, we're working closely with our customers to collaborate on the new operating plan changes. This year's iteration of Top 21 will be fully implemented by the end of July. And after that, we will begin on the next iteration of the operating plan. We will also identify additional opportunities to realize incremental improvement. As we eliminate work, we will tread out headcount and take out yards and locomotives, all while improving or maintaining customer service. We are excited about a strong momentum we're delivering across our operations, and for the full implementation of our new operating plan to unlock the value inherent in our network. I will now turn it over to Cindy, who will cover our financial achievements. Cindy Earhart : Thank you, Mike and good morning. I'll start with our record operating results on slide 13. The 5% increase in revenues, when combined with a slight decrease in railway operating expenses, resulted in a first quarter record for income from railway operations of $966 million, 16% higher than last year. We also achieved a first quarter record operating ratio of 66%, improving on last year's results by 330 basis points. We have started 2019 with positive momentum and are on track to deliver at least a 100 basis point improvement in our full year operating ratio as we discussed at Investor Day in February. Let's take a look at the component changes in operating expenses in more detail on slide 14. In total operating expenses were $8 million lower than last year's expenses. Fuel, materials and other and compensation and benefits were all lower than last year. These were partially offset by higher depreciation and purchase services and rents. Lower fuel price drove the decline in fuel expense. Material and others was lower due to increased gains on the sale of operating properties and the reduction in network velocity related costs that we experienced last year. Compensation and benefits was also down due to lower employment levels, higher capitalized labor, and a reduction in overtime and re-crew expense. These decreases were partially offset by higher wage rates. We expect headcount for the remainder of the year will continue to decline, and that our year-end headcount will be down at least 500 as compared to prior year. Depreciation was up reflecting capital additions. And finally, purchase services and rents were up due to intermodal volume related increases and increased IT spending, partially offset by favorable equipment rent expense, which is attributable to improved network velocity. Summarizing our financial results on slide 15, income from operations was a record $966 million for the first quarter. Other income increased by $36 million, primarily the result of higher investment returns on our corporate owned life insurance. Interest expense on debt was up $13 million over last year, due to higher overall debt balance compared to March of last year. Wrapping up our bottom line results, net income was $677 million, up 23% and diluted earnings per share was $2.51, a 30% improvement and both of these measures were first quarter records. Slide 16, depicts our first three months of cash flow. Cash from operations total $881million generating $414 million in free cash flow. We are committed to returning capital to shareholders, as evidenced by our $730 million of capital returned in the form of dividends and share repurchases during the first three months, a 45% increase over last year. Our first quarter record results reflect progress implementing our new strategic plan, improved network velocity and the additional capacity generated by Clean Sheeting set the stage for implementation of the new operating plan in the coming months, and as a result, the achievement of our financial goals. Thank you for your attention. I'll turn the call back to Jim. Jim Squires : Thank you, Cindy. The operational and financial progress we made in the first quarter gives us increased confidence we will achieve our full year and longer term goals. All of us are energized and united in our focus on delivering value for our customers and shareholders. Thank you for your attention and we'll now open the line for Q&A. Operator? Operator : [Operator instructions] Thank you. And our first question comes from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Allison Landry : Thanks. Good morning. I just had a couple of housekeeping items I wanted to ask about. But first, could you quantify the gain on sale and then in the comp and benefits line, what was the benefit from capitalized labor? And did you receive any payroll tax refund from the Railroad Retirement Board? Cindy Earhart : Yes, hi Allison. In terms of the gain on sale of operating property in the quarter it was about $11 million higher than last year. The capitalized labor increase was about $8 million and we did not have anything included in comp and benefits related to any kind of refund this quarter. Allison Landry : Okay, that's helpful. And then in terms of the decline in domestic intermodal, are you guys seeing a shift back to truck because of looser capacity and are broadly lower truck rates a risk to your overall pricing outlook? And if not for 2019, is it for 2020? So if you could help us think through that. Thanks. Alan Shaw : Allison, we're still very confident in our pricing plan and our volume outlook for our intermodal franchise. As I have discussed, we're here with some pretty tough weather conditions, which impacted not only our network, but the overall freight movements and we had some lane rationalizations which in the near-term slightly impacted volumes. Going forward we're optimistic about growth in domestic as our channel partners and we're pleased with the progress of rate increases that we're seeing as we're going through bid season right now. Allison Landry : Okay, thank you. Operator : Next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question. Jason Seidl : Thanks, operator. Hey Jim, hey Alan, hey Cindy. I'm going to stick intermodal, but I am going go on the international side here. How should we look at volume growth going forward considering that you guys talked about benefiting a little bit from a tariff pull forward in 1Q? Alan Shaw : Jason, as you noted it was above norm in the first quarter at pretty close to 10% volume growth in the international network. We certainly don't expect that to continue as we move throughout the year and we expect it to move back towards trend. Go ahead. Jason Seidl : And that's going to be still a little lower single digit. Alan Shaw : That's lower single digit GDP plus. But we're encouraged by the way it's continuing to stick in there. And part of that is our alignment with the vessel companies and the shipping lines that are adding capacity to the East Coast. Jason Seidl : Okay, that's good color. My follow up is going to be about sort of dealing with customers, dealing with the Service Transportation Board sort of a similar question I asked you, Alan, when you were down at Neer's [ph]. How's that going? I mean, we normally don't see railroads implement PSR and there's - and then there's no problems, but there's immediate service improvements. Has that been easier dealing with customers, dealing with the Surface Transportation Board? And do you think it's actually helped you any in terms of going to the customers for price increases? Jim Squires : Jason, it's Jim. Let me take the original part of that that relates to the STB. And then Alan can address your question about the about our customers. We're - let me say that we are in constant communication with the Surface Transportation Board. And we are looking forward to telling our story at the upcoming hearing and we think we have a great story to tell our service is significantly improved over last year, our network is running very well. And we think that the way that we have implemented accessorial charge increases is pro customer as well because they are aimed at increasing efficiencies that will benefit both of us. Alan? Alan Shaw : Jason, we've been very clear from the beginning, that as we implement PSR we're going to pivot a little bit and we're going to do it overtime and we're going to collaborate with our customers. And we're going to be very transparent, and we're going to be pro-growth. And we've done all of that. And our customers see it, they appreciate it. More importantly, they see the improvements in velocity. They see the improvements in the reliability of our service. And it'll - it reduces their overall costs because they're turning back equipment. And they want a service provider that's going to provide a platform for growth. And that's who we are. Jason Seidl : Okay, appreciate the time as always, everyone. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Ravi Shankar with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions. Ravi Shanker : Thanks, good morning everyone. Apologize if I missed this, can you just quantify incentive compensation this quarter versus last year. And also, I think you mentioned in your slides that you had capitalized labor as a tailwind in the comp and benefits line. Can you just elaborate in that a little bit more kind of what's driving that? And kind of how we see that trending for the rest of the year? Cindy Earhart : Ravi, yes, in terms of the incentive comp year-over-year, it's very similar between both periods. On the capitalized labor it was $8 million for the quarter. And that really relates to the fact that we had additional capital spending in the quarter. If you look back at the cash flow statement, you can see that the velocity of the network really gave us the ability to get out there early in the year and perform work at a lot faster pace than we were doing this time last year. And so that's how that capitalized labor relates. Ravi Shanker : And is that a similar level we can expect for coming quarters? Cindy Earhart : Yes, I think that's very similar. Ravi Shanker : Got it. And just a follow up on the truck market again, obviously, you've been very clear with the yield up strategy here. Just how environment sensitive is that? I mean, if we do see the truck market loosen more and potentially volumes start shifting back to truck are you guys going to stay at the course with pushing for big price increases or will you be kind of assuming a little bit of the wind is blowing? Alan Shaw : We are fully committed to testing the limits of market based pricing. We've been able to grow our intermodal franchise and tight truck conditions and in lose truck conditions. Right now the truck market is not nearly as tight as it was last year, but it's still tighter than overall balance. And there is an inherent advantage to intermodal relative to truck in terms of cost structure. And as we continue to improve our service product and provide that capacity for growth we're aligned with our channel partners on providing them a good service product that allows them to compete and allows them to grow. Ravi Shanker : Great, thank you Operator : The next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your questions. Scott Group : Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. So on the labor productivity so I see a three year target of 34%, how come this year is only 3% what changes that is so sort of backend loaded? And then, I think, Cindy mentioned a 500 reduction for the year, you've already done 400 so are we done sort of reducing headcount or is there upside to that 500? Jim Squires : Well, Scott, Cindy said at least 500 this year. And yes we have made more progress than even we expected in the first quarter in terms of headcount, so we are off to a good start. The implementation of Top 21 will give us another big opportunity to achieve labor efficiency, because we'll be running fewer trains and that will result in fewer crew starts and less [indiscernible]. Scott Group : Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe for Alan just a couple of things on coal, sometimes you give us guidance on sort of how to think about the quarterly run rates on export and domestic if you can maybe do that? Maybe talk about how much of the export thermo was locked in for the year given where API is and if we think export thermal is going to be dropping off what should that mean for coal RPU going forward? Alan Shaw : Scott, what I pointed you to was pressures in the export coal market, particularly the thermal side. And I also note that last year in the second quarter was our highest volume quarter in export coal. We handled a little bit over 7.9 million tons before dropping into the 6 million plus ton region in this third and fourth quarter. So the cost will be more difficult in the second quarter of this year. On the utility side, stockpiles are down and so there's the opportunity for stockpile rebuild although natural gas prices have certainly declined as of recent. On the thermal side, our pricing maybe locked in however not necessarily with our suppliers. And so that puts pressure on volumes moving forward. Although theoretically that coal could just move into the utility market. Scott Group : So when you think about all the moving pieces how should we think about coal RPU going forward? Jim Squires : I think there's going to be pressure on coal RPU because you're going to see - potentially you're going to see pressure on metallurgical seaborne coking coal on that pricing, still at elevated levels that allow U.S. coals to compete, but not at levels that we saw in third and fourth quarter of last year. Scott Group : Make sense. And then, Alan, can you just real quickly just give us the increase in the accessorial revenue this year? Alan Shaw : It was $23 million for the quarter. Scott Group : Higher year-over-year ? Alan Shaw : Yes. Scott Group : Okay, great. Thank you, guys. Appreciate it. Operator : Next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Amit Mehrotra : Thanks everybody congrats on the good results. First question, obviously, on the strong OR first quarter obviously is the high watermark for OR in a typical year and you do usually see as a significant step down in subsequent quarters. I'm just trying to square that with the guidance for at least 100 basis points of our improvement given that over 300 basis points improvement in the first quarter. I know there's some maybe outsize benefits in the first quarter, but anything worth highlighting that maybe will shift how we think about the sequential progression in the OR for this year? Jim Squires : Well, you're correct it's the first quarter typically is the high watermark for the operating ratio. And we would expect it to see the operating ratio trend favorably from here. And we expect that we will achieve overall for the full year at least the 300 basis points improvement in the operating ratio versus last year's reported OR. Amit Mehrotra : If I look at the last three quarters for the last two years versus the first quarter there is over 300 basis points decline in average OR last three quarters versus the first quarter is that the similar type of magnitude this year or is just the progress in the first quarter so significant that we should think about it differently? Jim Squires : We made a lot of progress in the first quarter and we've got a nice running start on the year and yes we would expect to see sequentially lower ORs and for the full year an OR at least 100 basis points lower than last year's reported operating ratio. Amit Mehrotra : Okay. Just one follow up from me on the yield-up initiative obviously there's some good traction there we saw it in the quarter, but maybe you can just offer some thoughts and just educate me a little bit on how much of your book of business that you've actually gone out to pursue the limits of market based pricing. And that's really just in the context of maybe what's contractual, what's not contractual, when that contractual businesses rolls. And then is it just a repricing of what comes up for repricing or are there some service adjustments that we should think about that may impact the top line as well. Alan Shaw : Yes, Amit, we generally touch or have the opportunity to reprice, renegotiate 50% of our business in any given year. We've got about 40%, left to renegotiate for this year. And it also includes not only pricing, but it includes looking at lanes that make sense for us and frankly, lanes in which we don't which we have too much complexity. And we talked about a little bit about that, with respect to some of the intermodal lane rationalizations that we affected in the first quarter. That's an ongoing initiative for us. We have rationalized our intermodal network in each of the last six years starting in 2013. It's general housekeeping. We did it last year, and still we're able to grow our revenues by 18%. It's all part of - it's not just about pricing. And it's not just about productivity, it's all part about margin improvement and making sure that we've got an efficient and reliable service product out there that we deliver every day. And we're pricing to the value of that product in the market. Amit Mehrotra : So just so I'm understanding your comment correctly, only 10% of the book of business today reflects your yield-up initiative. And so there's 90% left over the course of the next year and a half, is that the right interpretation? Alan Shaw : No, because we've been doing this for quite some time. So we have renegotiated 10% of our book so far this year. Amit Mehrotra : Okay, all right. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it. Operator : The next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your questions. Ken Hoexter : Great. Good morning. Alan, if I can just stick on the intermodal just to I guess clarify some of the network rationalization. Have you quantified what percent of lanes have been rationalized either last year? And maybe is there still a set percentage that's still to come as you think about the network? And then is there anything about that 60 mile per hour that's peak for the network. I don't know if that's more of my question, but - or is that just so you can match the intermodal speeds on the merchandise side? Jim Squires : Why don't we start there? And then Alan you can come back to the question about the lane rationalization. Mike, talk a little bit more about the speed increases. Mike Wheeler : Yes, so as we commingle traffic on to trains, a train becomes a train and we really don't want to have an intermodal speed and a merchandise speed out there. So we've raised them up where appropriate to all run it 60 mile an hour and take advantage of that velocity improvements and keep everything moving. Alan Shaw : And good morning, Ken. With respect to the lane rationalization, it's a very, very modest amount. And we really would not expect it to have any sort of material impact on volumes as we look over the course of a year. But we implemented these in mid-February, but we've been talking to our customers about it for several months in advance. And so it gives them the opportunity to look for alternative routing on Norfolk Southern. It may have an impact in the first month, but over the course of a year, it won't have any sort of impact at all. As I noted, we did it last year, and we still grew our intermodal revenue by 18%. Ken Hoexter : Wonderful. And then, Jim, I guess as a follow up, I don't know if this is for you or Mike, but what changes now that you've almost finished the Clean Sheeting and as you go into the next phase of Top 21 in the operation side. Is the Clean Sheeting done? And now you jump to I don't know, changing how you're starting the trains? What is going - what difference are we going to see when you move to that next phase? Jim Squires : Yes, so we have, we have wrapped up an initial round of Clean Sheeting that has contributed to the network performance improvements we've seen. So we view that as laying a foundation for Top 21. Which as Michael mentioned, we will implement - the first phase of which we will implement in July of this year. And that's where we really go in and reconfigure the operating plan itself. So we have laid the foundation by going in locally with Clean Sheeting and doing the work in the terminals and with local operations. And then we layer on top of that a new operating plan focused on the four things that Mike mentioned before. Mike? Mike Wheeler : The Clean Sheeting has really given us a lot of capacity out on the railroad to put in this new operating plan and that's what we're so excited about. So we're in good shape going into that because of the Clean Sheeting completion. Ken Hoexter : Appreciate the comments, guys. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Tom Wadewitz : Yes, good morning and congratulations on all the progress you're making on the initiatives. Wanted to ask you a little bit further about the Top 21, how do we think about the magnitude I think you're talking about it in terms of Mike you're saying this year's iteration of it, which implies you do some more next year and maybe even the following. How do we think about the magnitude of change to the train schedule? And maybe some of the bigger - where the bigger changes are in the train schedule with Top 21? Mike Wheeler : Yes, so obviously two big drivers of the new operating plan is going to be reduced train miles and reduced security at the car level. So both of those are good news from a productivity standpoint and a good news from the customer part. And then like we said, we'll be implementing that by the end of July and the resources then will start following out of that later on in the year. Tom Wadewitz : Okay. So - I'm sorry go ahead. Alan Shaw : Hey, Tom, this is Alan. And we will be communicating the impact on those changes with our customer base well in advance. So it's customer specific, it's land specific and it's known. Tom Wadewitz : Correct, that's right. Mike Wheeler : We're all very encouraged by what we're seeing so far because it will improve our velocity and will reduce our security in our train miles and make our railroad more resilient and give a greater capacity for growth. Jim Squires : Yes. Tom Wadewitz : So is there a magnitude that you can - so you're saying reduced train miles that makes a lot of sense, but is that 1%, is that 10% what's the kind of ballpark for change we might anticipate in this first iteration? Jim Squires : Well, it's really allowing us to hit the goals that we've put out on the service and productivity metrics. This operating plan is what's going to drive us to ensure we hit those goals. Tom Wadewitz : Okay. And what about - I guess for the second question you haven't really talked about yard productivity. How should we think that presumably as you implement Top 21 there'd be some effect not just on the schedule when the yards are linked together. So how do we think about the changes that maybe taking place in the yards and potentially timing for when you'd review how you use yards kind of how many hump yards you need that type of topic? Jim Squires : Yes, well, I'll tell you some of our small local serving yards we've actually already kind of taking out and stopped using them and they're just a little ones here across different areas of the network that we got out of the Clean Sheeting. On the large terminals as we implement the new train plan, the work will go away at some terminals and as that work goes away then we will rationalize those assets. Mike Wheeler : We use the dependence on terminals classification yards in particular being one of four fundamentals of Top 21, the other three being run one network, balanced flows and more regular servicing. Tom Wadewitz : So we could see evidence of that in second half given you're completing I guess the roll up in July? Mike Wheeler : Certainly. Tom Wadewitz : Yes. Okay, thanks for the time. Appreciate it. Operator : The next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions. Chris Wetherbee : Yes, hey thanks. Good morning. Maybe first just real quick on weather was there any impact from weather on a network on the system get call out from a cost perspective in the quarter? Jim Squires : No, we did see the network slow down during the vortex in February, but as Mike pointed out we bounced back quickly and we did not call out any special costs related to that February period. We had a couple of episodic areas, but we bounced back quickly and not real expensive, so yes. Chris Wetherbee : Okay, that's helpful. And then, Alan, I know we could coming back to this, but wanted to sort of talk a little bit about your comment about testing the limit to market based pricing, but maybe think about it from the merchandise angle there has been a lot of focus on intermodal. But just want to get a sense of sort of what that opportunity looks like as you're taking the sort of this next run through the book of business how sustainable and sort of how much opportunity do you feel like you have it seems like there is a window for you to continue to price through that maybe more than just the 2019 story, but wanted to get some perspective on that. Alan Shaw : Well, Chris, yeah, I agree with that, we've had 12 consecutive quarters of RPU growth in our merchandise network. Our primary form of competition is truck. And our franchise is rich with highway to rail conversion opportunities with over 50 million truck shipments a year in excess of 500 miles touching our network. So we are focused on conversion opportunities within the merchandise network. And if you look at our rate of year-over-year pricing increases, it has improved every quarter for the last six quarters. So there is opportunities there as we continue to improve the reliability of our service product and we layer on top of that a best-in-class consumer oriented customer experience it's going to make us highly competitive with truck. Chris Wetherbee : That's really helpful. Then just real quick in terms of that sort of 40% of the book that's still available for pricing this year, any way to break down of what sort of merchandise versus intermodal or potentially coal in that? Alan Shaw : It's relatively well balanced between the three. Chris Wetherbee : Okay, perfect. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it. Operator : The next question is from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your questions. Bascome Majors : Hey, thanks for taking my questions. Can you guys give us an update on where attrition is running across the network right now headcount wise? Jim Squires : Cindy? Cindy Earhart : Sure. I mean, typically, attrition is for us is around 2,000 people a year. And I think we're pretty much - that's pretty consistent this year as it's been in the past. Bascome Majors : Okay, thank you for that. And going back to the KPIs you laid out and reiterated from the Investor Day for the PSR implementation. Appreciate the transparency in setting the 2019 goals incrementally here. And it looks like you also raised the service delivery goals. So that's great. But for the current year, if we take a step back from where you are right now, which is the most stretch of those five things that you laid out? And maybe which do you think is going to be most correlated with margin improvement that we can see for the company as a whole? Thanks. Jim Squires : All five metrics are important to the success of the plan, and that's why we've laid them out publicly. So I think we're progressing well on each of them. We noted some where things are progressing even better than expected cars online, for example, and you can see in the cars online goal for 2019 that we're already at 2021. In other cases, we saw some temporary things in the first quarter, Mike mentioned changes in the coal network that detracted somewhat from our train weight goal, but over the course of the full year, we believe that we can hit the goal shown for train weight as well. So, I think, things are really going well across the board with the productivity initiatives, with the service delivery index and with cars online. Top 21 will be a big step change and a big driver of further success, particularly in the productivity metrics. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Justin Long : Thanks. Good morning and congrats on the quarter. So to start with the yield-up initiative, you've talked about growth in higher return businesses. When you look across your different businesses today, where do you see the highest incremental returns. I know intermodal isn't your highest margin business. But given it seems to be a key growth area, you mentioned the multi-year revenue CAGR of around 10% at the Investor Day, would that be your highest incremental ROIC business? Or would you say that some areas in general merchandise would be at the top of the list? Jim Squires : Well, we think we have margin opportunity across the board. And in terms of the top line initiatives, that's what yield-up fundamentally is about. So there's incremental margin potential in all three major lines of business. And merchandise naturally has some significant incremental margin potential because of the way the trains run, and one more car on the train comes at very low variable additional costs. So the natural economics of that business favor the incremental. But as we saw last year, we posted very strong incremental margin in our intermodal businesses as well. And that's partly because of the pricing trend that we were able to drive last year with our customers with our channel partners. Alan, any other reflections on. Alan Shaw : Yes, I'll talk a little bit less about pricing. I'll talk about productivity. Within intermodal we've worked with our channel partners to provide a more productive, less complex network. And as a result that coupled with the strong pricing that we've achieved in the intermodal franchise over the last six quarters has really driven strong incremental margins in our intermodal network. And it now competes very favorably for capital with us. And that's one of the reasons we have the most robust intermodal franchise in the East. And it's a growth driver for us and why we're confident about a 10% revenue CAGR in intermodal. I'll talk about productivity within merchandise. I previously talked about pricing strength and the momentum within merchandise. I'm very confident that with the implementation of top 21 this summer, which is targeted towards our merchandise network we're going to see even better incremental margins in our merchandise network. Justin Long : Okay, that's helpful. And secondly, a couple of quick things for Cindy. So Cindy, any updated thoughts around the magnitude of gains on sale this year? Just curious what's getting baked into the 2019 guidance? And then, also just longer term thinking about the 60 OR target that's out there, could you talk about what that assumes for the progression of export coal versus where we are today? Cindy Earhart : Justin, in terms of games on the sales operating property, I think, in the Investor Day, we gave guidance of around $30 million to $40 million annually. Obviously, that's very lumpy, it's very hard to predict. We've said in the past that we're going to continue to look very hard at property that we no longer need to use in the business and to try and monetize that. And we're continuing to do that. I think that we would update the guidance a bit for this year, probably more in the $50 million range right now is a good guide. In terms of export, Alan, if you want to comment. Alan Shaw : Justin, what we had talked about at Investor Day was a slight decline in coal revenue over the course of the next three years, and that's reflective of increased pressure from renewables and natural gas. And then the expectation that the elevated seaborne coking coal prices will decline. And you can see that in the forward curve. Justin Long : Okay, I'll leave it at that. I appreciate the time. Operator : Next question is coming from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC. Please proceed with your questions. Walter Spracklin : Yes. Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. So on the tax rate, the tax rate came in a little bit lower, Cindy, I was wondering if there's anything that you would flag in terms of items in that tax line and does that adjust, I believe you are guiding us at 24%. Would that cause you to change your 24% guidance on a go forward basis? Cindy Earhart : The effective tax rate in the first quarter was 21.4%, which had tax benefits Walter for stock-based compensation, which is pretty typical in the first quarter, but we also had the benefits associated with those higher returns on company owned life insurance. So for the full year, I would expect that the effective rate will be somewhere between 23% and 24%. Walter Spracklin : 23%, 24%. And then back to kind of 24% run rate after that, is that right? Cindy Earhart : Correct. Walter Spracklin : Okay, all right. And then, Alan, when I look at and I try to put together all of the kind of guidance you gave in terms of coal market down. I think you said your merchandise is going to be flat for the rest of the year, and then intermodal up, but not quite as - not at the same growth rate as the year prior. If we put all that into the mix, it seems and feels like we're getting a flat to up slightly type of volume growth for the rest of the year. If I'm off mark there let me know. But is there anything going into 2020 absent and let's just not even discuss coal right now, but any of your other markets that would suggest that you would see any volume lift that would take you above this kind of flattish run rate in merchandise and steady low-single digit run rate in intermodal that you would flag is there any, is there any competitive contracts coming up that you're looking at or anything that would accelerate volume growth going into 2020? Alan Shaw : Walter, may I clarify, you asking about the remainder of 2019 or are you talking about 2020? Walter Spracklin : So the both I'm just looking to see if I'm, if I've got it right with what you said for the remainder of 2019. And that being flat merchandise, down coal slowing growth in intermodal suggests to me that you're around that maybe 1%, 1.5% level for the full year based on that guidance. And that seems a little muted. And what I'm asking I guess is if we're going into 2020, is there anything that you're hopeful of that will kick start volume growth to somewhat above that kind of 1%, 1.5% range overall? Alan Shaw : Yes, I would make sure that you recognize when I talk - if I do talk about slowing growth in intermodal, it's not relative to the first quarter, it's relative to the 18% growth that we had last year in our intermodal franchise. Yes, I think the big one of the lists that we're going to continue to benefit from is our improved service product, and that takes time for customers to see that and for them to fit that into their supply chains. But you can see that in our results as our velocity has picked up in March, our merchandise volumes picked up in March as well. So we're confident that as we have an improving service product and put on a best-in-class consumer oriented experience, we're going to continue to compete very well with truck and it's going to enhance our competitive position. And the economy is still pretty strong, as I look at where we are today relative to our outlook. At the end of last year really not much has changed at all. So we feel pretty good about where we are and we're confident about where we're headed. And also recognize that our primary focus is on yield-up and margin improvement, not volume. Walter Spracklin : Okay, thank you very much. Operator : Next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions. Brandon Oglenski : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, Alan, along those lines more specifically you called out a 5% revenue CAGR for three years in merchandise and 10% in intermodal at the Investor Day. Is there any reason why you can't attain those levels this year in those segments? Alan Shaw : I think, we're very confident about our three year plan. We're confident about this year, we're just - within intermodal we're coming off a very, very difficult comps related to last year. Brandon Oglenski : Okay. But I guess in that context, as you improve your service, I mean, should we be expecting this as all yield for those next three years or should there be more volume in that mix looking forward through 2021. Alan Shaw : We're certainly yielding up. And you can see that in our RPU across all three of our business units. But it is a component of volume and price. Brandon Oglenski : Okay, appreciate that. I know it's been a long call. But Mike, if we can come back to the security comment you made in about fewer train miles. I mean, is this just a function of consolidating train starts running longer trains and more direct or what was going on in the past that's going to change the security of the network? Mike Wheeler : No, you're exactly right, it's commingling the different lines of business and running them direct which ends up running bigger, heavier trains and that results in less trains out there and less train starts. Brandon Oglenski : All right, thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions. Brian Ossenbeck : Hey, good morning. Thanks for getting me on the call here. Just two quick ones. Alan, you mentioned customers are starting to get interested in the improving service product. What areas of growth do you think you'd see the biggest upside? And have you started to have those conversations yet? Or is it just too early to tell? Alan Shaw : Absolutely, we're having these conversations. We're having them every day and they're data driven. We have shared KPIs with our customers. And those KPIs helping form the service delivery index that that Mike has talked with you about. Where service is driving additional volume, you can see it in merchandise, we're going to see it in intermodal. And we've also talked about how improved service enhanced our utility coal volumes in the first quarter although offset by some weather disruptions and some production issues and planned outages. Brian Ossenbeck : All right. And then, Jim, if you can just talk about the leadership team both the executive and sort of the field operational level, you made some changes recently you've got a new Chief Transformation Officer, imagine that was part of the plan initially, but maybe if you can just talk about who you've brought on if there's anybody external with more PSR implementation experience do you think you can fill those needs internally are there any other big changes or hires that you feel like you need to make given you've got some good momentum going here to kick off the plan? Jim Squires : We are focused on driving shareholder value in the leadership transitions and changes that we have made that's the goal. Just being in the first quarter of the new strategic plan and it made sense to us to shuffle things around a little bit. And get people focused on some of it and focused on working intently from a leadership standpoint on the key initiatives in the strategic plan. So that was what was behind the realignment. We have brought in others with PSR experience into our operational layout to help us push out Top 21. So we're fortunate to have on staff there a couple of individuals with that sort of experience that can work with us and help lead us as we move through Top 21 in the months to come. Brian Ossenbeck : And Jim those folks are in the MNC or are they at a higher strategic level, can you give some more context as to where you go perhaps there? Thank you. Jim Squires : Sure. So you had a chance to meet Mike Farrell in Atlanta at Investor Day. Brian Ossenbeck : Yes. Jim Squires : And he's running transportation for us including the MNC. And then we have working in our NPL a couple of individuals with PSR experience from other relevance. NPL being kind of nerve center for Top 21 roll out. Brian Ossenbeck : All right, thanks for the time. Operator : Our final question is coming from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. David Vernon : Hey, guys. I want to circle back to the T&E productivity metrics on slide 10. Just that 2019 to 2020, 2020 to 2021 ramp of sort of 15% gains in T&E productivity after the 2019 period. One would think that most productivity programs like you get a front end loaded benefit not a backend loaded benefit what specifically is going to change after this year that's going to get you that material shift in T&E productivity into 2021? Alan Shaw : Well, Mike, talked about iterations of Top 21 with more to come in 2020 and 2021 after we implement the first phase of Top 21 this year. So that's what's behind the further increases in T&E productivity in the out years. I would say this our overall strategy is to take away the work and then push labor productivity, but we want to make sure the activity is out of the network before we work on the labor productivity side of things. So for that reason the T&E productivity is a little bit backend loaded. David Vernon : And just when you look at the metrics though it seems like there's a lot backend loaded, I'm just trying to get my sense for like what operationally is going to be different about the Top 21 plan after you get out of 2019 that's going to get you that 15% gain for year? Alan Shaw : So just remember when we start this in July as Jim noted we start taking the work out and the resources come out after that. So you get a run rate after that that flows into the following years and then as we do the next iteration. And we expect to do the next iteration quicker that will put in the next implementation of the plan, take the work away and those resources come out as well. David Vernon : All right. And maybe Cindy just as a quick follow up on the free cash flows, the cash flow statement there was about $150 million of proceeds from prior land sales, is there a range of cash that you know is going to be coming in as we get across the rest of this year from prior transactions? Cindy Earhart : No, David, I wouldn't say so, I mean, I think we had a large sale in the first quarter related to our Atlanta office buildings and - which we're leasing back that's pretty unusual. David Vernon : So that number should be kind of flattish for the rest of the year? Cindy Earhart : Yes. Jim Squires : It's just smaller related to more whatever you assume. David Vernon : Okay. All right, thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the question and answer session. I'll now turn the call back over to Mr. Jim Squires for closing comments. Jim Squires : Thank you to everyone who participated in today's call. In our quest to reimagine possible for Norfolk Southern the first quarter of 2019 was just the beginning and we look forward to updating you as we continue implementing our new strategic plan. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode and a brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Pete Sharbel, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Sharbel, you may now begin. Pete Sharbel : Thank you, Rob and good morning. Before we begin, please note that during today's call, we may make certain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and may differ materially from actual results. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. The slides of the presenters are available on our website at norfolksouthern.com in the Investors section, along with our non-GAAP reconciliation. Additionally, a transcript and downloads will be posted after the call. Now it is my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's Chairman, President and CEO, Jim Squires. Jim Squires : Good morning everyone, and welcome to Norfolk Southern's second quarter 2019 earnings call. Joining me today are Alan Shaw, Chief Marketing Officer; Mike Wheeler, Chief Operating Officer; and Cindy Earhart, Chief Financial Officer. With the results in the second quarter and first half of 2019, we are on track to meet the commitments we made to shareholders in February, namely an operating ratio this year at least 100 basis points below 2018 and a 60 OR by 2021. Our railroad is performing very well. The transition to our new PSR-based operating plan TOP21 went flawlessly and we are already seeing the financial benefits with more to come. Top'21 and Clean Sheeting exposed numerous opportunities for cost savings in the second half of this year and beyond, which we are now aggressively pursuing. These savings coupled with the modest top line growth we expect in the back half give us confidence we will achieve our stated goals even amidst economic uncertainty. Turning to the financial results for the second quarter. Income from operations was $1.1 billion, an increase of 4%. Net income was $722 million, up 2% over the prior year, and EPS was $2.70, an 8% increase. The operating ratio improved by 100 basis points versus last year to 63.6%. First half net income and EPS experienced double-digit percentage growth, while we reduced our operating ratio by 210 basis points to 64.8%. Looking ahead, we expect continued year-over-year improvement in the operating ratio in the second half, leading to an OR for the full-year at least 100 basis points lower than 2018. Before turning it over to Alan, Mike and Cindy, let me say a few more words about TOP21 and our outlook. As you know, the first phase of the new operating plan, which we fully implemented on July 1 focused on our merchandise network. As Mike will highlight TOP21 reduced plans circuity for merchandise and auto traffic by 20% and that's in addition to circuity reductions accomplished earlier in the year through increased fluidity. 87% of the cars in the merchandise network are now operating with new trip plans. Despite these sweeping changes, crucial network performance metrics, train speeds, terminal dwell and Cars-On-Line, and corresponding customer service metrics have held steady new record best levels. As we implemented TOP21, it's also important to highlight that we successfully addressed adverse weather conditions, including floodwater from the Missouri River, which severed our line to Kansas City for more than a month. As I highlighted during our Investor Day, we are transforming our culture to ensure that every employee is focused on achieving our goals and is aligned with how Norfolk Southern will pursue them. Our engineering department is a perfect example of this winning culture. Despite the challenges presented from the flooding conditions I highlighted; they didn't miss a beat. They work together to execute our plan, quickly restore our track, and get us moving again. This is just one example of why this team is the best in the business. Since launching TOP21 we have seen no adverse effects on network performance or quality of our customer service. The benefits of TOP21 reduced circuity and improved velocity are already apparent, as we can now serve the majority of our customers with more predictable trends at times and fewer assets to move their freight. As I noted, we are already seeing a favorable financial impact from TOP21 as well. In conjunction with velocity improvements from Clean Sheeting and pre-implementation work earlier this year, TOP21 has enabled us to reduce employment levels well ahead of plan, which Cindy will discuss later. We saw this in the second quarter, with decreases in head count related expense, materials expense and equipment rents. We're confident that as the new plan takes hold in the second half favorable year-over-year comparisons in TOP21 related expense categories will accelerate, and we've already started work on Phase II of the plan. Turning to our outlook for the balance of 2019. We expect modest volume and revenue growth. As Alan will explain, the growth is expected to come from select merchandise lines of business and from a resumption of Intermodal growth consistent with commentary by our channel partners. Even as we pursue growth, we are determined to exploit every efficiency we uncover from the new operating plan. As a result of TOP21, we see opportunities for additional cost savings and serving yards, local operations and locomotive maintenance among other areas. At Investor Day, I described our belief that to keep up in a rapidly changing world a company must constantly reexamine its culture. Openness to new people and new ideas is critical, so as having the right leaders, in the right jobs, doing the right things, committed to shareholder value. That remains our mantra. As new leaders across a broad spectrum of functions dig deep into established ways of doing business. All of us are working together and seeking ways to improve service for our customers, manage our assets, control our costs, operate safely and develop our people. We continue to transform Norfolk Southern and are excited about the progress we are making. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Alan. Alan Shaw : Thank you, Jim, and good morning everyone. In the second quarter, we continued to execute our strategic plan of leveraging our improving service product to yield up and drive greater margins. The outcome of these efforts allowed NS to grow revenue and income in a challenging freight environment. We partner with our customers daily on these initiatives, through constant communication and collaboration. This has proven an effective approach, clearly demonstrated as we successfully completed the implementation of the TOP21 operating plan on July 1. Throughout the second quarter we worked in concert with our customers on the impending improvements through numerous face-to-face meetings. This collaboration, coupled with a flawless execution by our operating team resulted in a seamless implementation. As shown on Slide 6, we delivered a second quarter revenue gain of 1%, despite a 4% volume decline. This marks Norfolk Southern's tenth consecutive quarter of revenue growth, building on last year's second quarter revenue increase of 10%, slower economic growth drove volume declines in Intermodal, export coal and steel. Volume decreases were offset by the continued implementation of our strategy to price to the value of our improving service product, generating a 5% increase in revenue per unit. Merchandise delivered a record for quarterly revenue with a 2% revenue gain, despite a 3% volume decline. Revenue growth was driven by improved pricing and volume gains in our aggregates and agriculture franchises from increased network velocity. Midwest flooding adversely impacted merchandise volumes, primarily in our automotive segment. Steel volumes were down 8%, due to tariff impacts and lower steel prices. Pipeline activity continues to decrease NGL volumes. Increased truck capacity, higher inventories and Midwest flooding negatively impacted Intermodal revenue, which declined 2% year-over-year. Intermodal volume declined 4%, due to reduced domestic volume that was partially offset by 7% growth in our international franchise. Revenue per unit increased 2% year-over-year with solid pricing, reflecting the value of our service product offset by the negative mix associated with increased international volume. Coal revenue was flat year-over-year, as strong pricing was offset by a 6% volume decline, primarily in our export market. The pricing helped increase revenue per unit by 7%. RPU was also enhanced by the positive mix associated with increased volume in our utility south market. Production challenges at several mines and low seaborne coal prices resulted in lower export volume against difficult comps. Utility volumes improved year-over-year, due to weather delayed tons from the first quarter, service improvements, and stockpile replenishment. Pricing to the value of our service product continues to produce positive results, with RPU growth in all three business units, and a 5% RPU improvement overall. This gain highlights the successful execution of our plan and contributes to the foundation of our long-term success. Moving to Slide 7. Consumer confidence remains high. Unemployment is near a 50-year low, and consumer activity is still strong. The ISM manufacturers indexes dropping, although still an expansion range. Tariff uncertainty remains a headwind, primarily in the manufacturing sector. Taking together, we remain confident and continued growth in the economy, although at a lower rate than what we experienced in 2018. Based on this economic backdrop, we expect modest year-over-year improvement in revenue, volume, and RPU in the second half of the year, with the bulk of that growth in the fourth quarter. This growth is a result of our strategy, the success of our TOP21 operating plan and our continued focus on customer alignment. Increased pricing is the largest driver of growth projections with RPU in the second half expected to increase despite lower diesel rates and difficult comparisons to the second half of last year, as well as the impact of lower seaborne pricing in the export market. I will now highlight some of the primary drivers of our expectations in each of the business units. Within merchandise, we expect oil price differentials will support demand for crude oil shipments to the East Coast. Based on a forecast of 3% increase and U.S. light vehicle production, automotive volume is projected to increase in the second half. Aggregate and sand volumes are anticipated to benefit from improved service levels and a normalized spend throughout the year. Pipeline activity is expected to continue to negatively impact shipments of natural gas liquids while steel markets will be disadvantaged by weak demand, tariff impacts, and low commodity prices. Our continued focus on pricing to the value of our service product is expected to increase revenue on flat annual volumes. Intermodal volume is projected to finish 2019, slightly above 2018 levels, as expected growth in the second half will offset first half declines. We project second half growth in both the international and domestic markets resulting from sustained year-over-year growth forecast for consumer spending. Although, domestic growth will be tempered by increased capacity in the truck market. Our coal markets will likely continue to decline in comparison to 2018. API 2 prices are forecasted to remain at low levels in the second half, while seaborne coking coal prices are projected to decline impacting both volume and RPU. Utility volumes will be impacted by natural gas prices and weather. In summary, we expect total coal volume to finish below 2018 levels, while RPU is also pressured. We continue to leverage the value of our service product and secure opportunities that set the stage for long-term success. We remain focused on margin improvement and growth initiatives supported by a consistent and efficient service product that the market values. I will now turn it over to Mike for an update on operations. Mike Wheeler : Thank you, Alan. Today, I will update you on the state of the railroad and the successful implementation of our TOP21 operating plan. In the second quarter, we continue to drive service improvements for our customers, finalized our new TOP21 operating plan, and achieved record operating ratios for a second quarter and the first six months of the year. We continue to build on our strong momentum and are confident in our ability to deliver strong value for shareholders and support for our customers. Moving to Slide 9. Our continued focus on execution of our plan and the principles of precision scheduled railroading is evidenced in our performance metrics. Specifically, our train performance, terminal dwell, shipment consistency and car level velocity for the second quarter were the best on record for any quarter. These achievements are due to the relentless execution by our operations team and laid a firm foundation for our new TOP21 operating plan. We want to thank our field employees for their unwavering and relentless focus on safety, service and efficiency. Turning to our service and productivity metrics on Slide 10. These metrics are aligned with our strategic plan, which is built upon providing a service product that will allow our customers to grow with us. As before, the blue bars represent our respective goals for 2019. Starting with the Service Delivery Index, which is the on-time delivery performance of our scheduled shipments indexed to 2018. This is a customer facing metric that combines shipments consistency, which measures trip plan adherence for general merchandise as well as automotive traffic and Intermodal availability. I am pleased to report that we are on track to exceed our goal for 2019, due to our first half service performance and flawless implementation of the TOP21 plan. As noted on the previous slide, we are delivering a record number of shipments to our customers on time. We are trending ahead to where we thought we would be with the T&E productivity goal for this year.  We anticipate this trend will continue for the rest of the year as we fully implement our TOP21 plan. As mentioned during the last call, our train weight goal is backend loaded and we will be monitoring and working on this goal for this year as our new TOP21 operating plan is implemented. We are already seeing improvements in our general merchandise train weights, which are offset by headwinds associated with Intermodal and Coal volumes. Locomotive productivity continues to be another strong metric for NS and we are tracking to meet or exceed our goal for this year. Locomotive as well as T&E productivity are being negatively impacted by the decline in gross ton miles. But we are actively adjusting resources to ensure we remain on track to meet our goals. Our team is flexible, dynamic and will adjust to ensure we hit our targets as business levels change. And the Cars On-Line is trending very positively, thanks to our fast and consistent service product. It should also be noted that this number includes cars in storage of approximately 15,000, up 5,000 from the prior quarter. This is the capacity dividend we have referred to previously, which we created in part by the timely adjustment of our equipment distribution to match market conditions. I would also like to update you on the progress of our new TOP21 operating plan on Slide 11. As you may recall from our Investor Day, our new operating plan has four major objectives. Operator, is one network. A balanced train plan between terminals. Serve our customers frequently; and reduce dependence on major terminals. This iteration of TOP21 primarily focused on our general merchandise bulk and automotive business. As Jim noted, we are already working on the next iteration of our operating plan, while we continue to harvest the opportunities from the newly implemented operating plan. We implemented some of our operating plan changes throughout the second quarter. These targeted implementations were concentrated primarily around the edges of our network. The successful implementation of the full plan on July 1, which involved over 180 iterations before implementation was a partnership between network planning and optimization who model the plan, marketing view is involved in both developing and communicating the plan and transportation who executed the plan. As promised, we have been and will continue to work closely with our customers to collaborate on the new operating plan. Prior to TOP21 implementation, we held 19 joint customer employee Town Halls across the network and that one-on-one with all large customers. This provided our customers the opportunity to better understand TOP21 and the benefits of the plan. Turning to Slide 12. I would like to give you a comparison of the final TOP21 plan that was implemented on July 1 versus the baseline plan. A key pillar of the new operating plan is expanding the use of distributed power for our merchandise and automotive trains. TOP21 will also drive at least a 20% reduction in circuitous miles by utilizing capacity at regional yards, focusing less on creating density at hump yards. There will also be 15% reduction in train miles for manifest, automotive and locals, as well as at least a 10% reduction in train starts. This was a significant undertaking with just under 90% of merchandise and automotive traffic, receiving a new trip plan. This will result in a more efficient network with fewer trains as shown on the graph on the right. We are confident that execution of our new operating plan will drive further improvement in the near and long-term. I will now turn it over to Cindy, who will cover the financials. Cindy Earhart : Thank you, Mike, and good morning. I'll begin with our operating results on Slide 14. Income from railway operations was $1.1 billion, up 4% improvement over the prior year and a second quarter record, driven by 1% increase in revenues and a 1% decrease in operating expense. Our operating ratio was 63.6%, also a second quarter record and a 100-basis point improvement on last year's results. We continue to make significant progress on the financial goals of our strategic plan and expect that our full year operating ratio will improve at least 100 basis points over the prior year. Slide 15 illustrates the changes to operating expenses. In total operating expenses were $12 million lower than last year's expenses. As we recognize the benefits associated with our improved network velocity ahead of the full TOP21 implementation in early July. And looking at each of the income statement line items, lower fuel price during the quarter, drove the decline in fuel expense. Purchase services and rents were down, due to a decline in equipment rents, a function of improved network fluidity and lower volumes. These decreases were partially offset by planned increases in technology spending. Materials and other were slightly higher than prior year. Our operational initiatives drove a reduction in the number of locomotives and service and freight cars-on-line, resulting in $10 million of savings associated with materials. These expense reductions were offset by higher claim costs of $12 million, driven by increased environmental and loss and damage expenses. While compensation and benefits expense was up slightly, we continue to see a decline in head count. Average headcount for the second quarter was down over 1,200 sequentially, compared to the first quarter. The operational improvements from Clean Sheeting and running a consistent plan every day have resulted in the pull forward of benefits from reduced head count. We expect headcount for the remainder of the year will continue to decline as we reduce resources as a result of our TOP21 implementation. During the second quarter, we had savings of $24 million, due to lower employment levels over time and recruit. In addition, we also had lower incentive compensation. However, these savings were offset largely due to the absence of last year's employment tax refund, as well as higher wage rates. You will recall that second quarter 2018 benefited from a $31 million refund from employment taxes on stock-based compensation. Finally, depreciation was up, reflecting our increased capital base. Let's move to our summarized financial results on Slide 16. During second quarter, we recognized a $28 million impairment loss related to certain natural resource assets that we seek to monetize. We continue to execute on our strategic initiatives, and that includes evaluating all non-core assets to ensure we are driving the greatest return for investors. This loss included in other income was offset in part by gains from non-operating property sales and higher investment returns on our corporate-owned life insurance.  Interest expense on debt was up $22 million due to higher overall debt balance, compared to June of last year. Wrapping up our bottom-line results. Net income was $722 million, up 2%, and diluted earnings per share was $2.70, an 8% improvement. Both of these measures are second quarter record. Slide 17 depicts our cash flow for the first half of the year. Cash from operations totaled almost $2 billion, generating nearly $1 billion in free cash flow. We are committed to returning capital to shareholders as evidenced by the $1.5 billion of capital returned in the form of dividends and share repurchases, a 36% increase over last year. We are executing on our strategic plan and are confident we will continue to produce improved financial performance that drives shareholder value. Thanks for your attention. I'll turn the call back to Jim. Jim Squires : Thank you, Cindy. As the first half of the year demonstrates, we are laser focused on executing today, while planning for tomorrow. And as we have done before, we won't rest when we reach our goals. Each and every member of the NS team is working in unison to achieve our efficiency and growth objectives. Thank you for your attention. And we'll now open the line for Q&A. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Allison Landry : Good morning. Thanks. Just given the current weak volume backdrop and the negative freight indicators and economic indicators, do you have less confidence in the long-term revenue CAGR targets that you set out at the Analyst Day. And maybe if you could also speak to whether you've seen any change in the pricing environment sequentially? Jim Squires : Good morning, Allison. Let me begin by saying that we are focused on the things that we can control, and those things are delivery of revenue growth. Alan described our modest growth objective in the second half through pricing to the value of our service, and volume growth in select merchandise verticals, which I'll turn it over to him in a minute to describe further. At the same time, we are very focused on the productivity and efficiency opportunities that we have uncovered through Clean Sheeting and through TOP21 implementation. So, we're focused on the things that we can control and we are very confident that we will hit our goals this year, at least 100 basis points improvement in the operating ratio over last year and 60 by 2021. Alan, why don't you dig in to the outlook a little bit further. Alan Shaw : Sure. Allison, we remain fully committed and confident in the execution of our strategy. As you know, it's a balanced strategy and that's delivering service growth and productivity. We've got the most powerful Intermodal franchise in the east, which is married to the consumption part of the U.S. economy and the economy continues to move in the direction of the consumer, and the consumer related economic indicators are still relatively strong. We've got a diverse merchandise franchise, which offers many opportunities for growth in the second half of the year. We're looking for growth in automotive consistent with projections for improved U.S. light vehicle production. We're looking for growth in the crude oil markets. We're looking for growth in sand and aggregates as well due to improved service, and more normalized shipping patterns. Our read of the take is that this is going to offset some headwinds that we're seeing in other markets, such as NGLs and the steel market, and our Intermodal franchise outlook is very consistent with what we're hearing from our channel partners. With respect to pricing, we continue to see strength in pricing. This past quarter was the second-best quarter and year-over-year improvement in pricing in the last seven years. And we've had seven consecutive quarters of sequential year-over-year gains and pricing in our merchandise franchise. So, we've got a rapidly improving service product. We're building credibility with our customers and we're pricing to the value of that product. Jim Squires : So, Allison, to sum up, we are determined to realize revenue growth opportunities wherever we can in the second half and for the duration of the plan, and I'd like to turn it over to Mike, if I may just to talk a little bit more about the productivity and efficiency opportunities, which we are also aggressively pursuing right now. Mike Wheeler : Yes, sure. So, the first thing we're doing is, working on harvest in the opportunities out of the new operating plan, as the new operating plan was put in place. It's uncovered even more opportunities for us to become efficient in take cost out, and that includes an additional tranche of DP trains that will help us as well. The other thing we're looking at is making sure we're really synced up well with the local operating plan, with the implementation of the new train plan and that will also give us opportunity to create some efficiencies while still ensuring that that we give a good service product to the customers. The other thing we continue to look at is the locomotive fleet. We see some opportunities there in the locomotive fleet, as well as how we maintain the locomotive fleet, what are the opportunities going forward there. And then last, but not least, we are already starting to model the new \u2013 the next phase of the operating plan, which encompasses all our traffic on the network, which we'll plan on rolling out early next year. So, a lot going on to continue to work on productivity and efficiency. Jim Squires : So, to sum it all up, ours is a balanced plan that positions us for enhanced shareholder value in any environment. Allison Landry : That's all really helpful and definitely encouraging to hear the pricing comments. If I could just ask one more question on the comp and benefits per employee. Cindy, it was really helpful when you outlined some of the year-over-year factors there, but in terms of sort of thinking about this on a dollar basis or per employee basis. Is this kind of the right range to model this going forward? Cindy Earhart : Well Allison, yes, thanks for the question. As you've noted, we had really good head start on reducing our headcount. Year-over-year we're down about 1,500 and as I said, sequentially about 1,200. When you look at the reductions that we've made so far in that 1,200, 1,500, about half of the ones we've made conductor trainees. So, obviously they are at a much lower pay rate than you would say our average employee. So, you've seen a little bit of that impact.  In other words, the take-out it's not quite as high as you would normally think for an average employee. But going forward, we are going to continue to work on head count. You saw what Mike presented in terms of TOP21. The number of train start reductions they\u2019re looking at. So, we're going to continue to push to reduce headcount, not only in T&E, but in all areas of the company, we're looking for additional productivity. Allison Landry : Great. Thank you, guys. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Jordan Alliger : Yes. Hi. Good morning. So, the service metrics, many of them are looking good like dwell and velocity pointing in the right direction, which suggests that PSR is kicking in. I'm just sort of wondering, I know you sort of reaffirmed the 100-basis points improvement, but how do you think about how that starts to really dig in and move that operating ratio lower as we move through the second half of the year and into 2020 and beyond, from a timing standpoint I guess more than anything? Alan Shaw : Thank you, Jordan. The service metrics and the network velocity metrics are trending very favorably and that's something we're extremely proud of, as I guess is obvious. Having just cut over to an operating \u2013 a new operating plan with far-reaching effects on our traffic. So, we've seen that in all of the metrics that you mentioned and, in the metrics, that Mike went through as well. That service platform and the service delivery index goal we've set for ourselves, which we're trending well toward, are the basis of everything we're trying to do, in terms of the revenue and on the expense and productivity side as well. So, yes, we do expect to see. We already are seeing significant opportunities for savings as a result of TOP21 implementation and the Clean Sheeting that preceded it. Jordan Alliger : Great. So, I mean \u2013 yes, I mean, basically, I'm just trying to get a sense that you know obviously you're literally early days in terms of flipping the switch July 1, but presumably as the metrics improve, operating ratio improves, I mean it's \u2013 that's how it translates from here whether it be headcount whether rents et cetera. Jim Squires : Yes, of course. And so, we are still expecting to produce an operating ratio at least 100 basis points better than last year for the full-year 2019 and are confident we're going to get there. Now remember that we did have a significant property sale in the fourth quarter of last year and that resulted in a gain and we\u2019re comparing to that fully loaded 2018 result. Jordan Alliger : Just one more quick question. The Phase II, I assume of TOP21 will include the Intermodal network sometime early next year. While you're doing that network change, will you \u2013 do you expect to continue to be able to push for volumes on the Intermodal network as you're undergoing that portion of TOP21? Jim Squires : We do, we do. Intermodal has been our volume growth engine and it has been a significant contributor and growing contributor to revenue and bottom line as well. So yes, we continue to expect to grow in that network even as we begin considering how and how much of it two-fold into the TOP21 operating plan. Jordan Alliger : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Brian Ossenbeck : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask Mike, when you look at the operating metrics, fuel efficiency, got a little bit worse. When you look at GTMs for this quarter was that something that you expected coming out of \u2013 the cut over from the operating plan or was that something else that was going on from a mix perspective? If you look at the other results of some of the class ones this quarter, they start to see some pretty good increases in efficiencies. So, it's not one of the metrics you've talked about too much in the past. I just wanted to get your thoughts on how that trends for the back half and into next year? Mike Wheeler : Yes. The fuel efficiency, was really not impacted by the TOP21 plan. It was really driven by the drop-off in gross ton miles. So, we've got a lot of initiatives to help drive that. And the coal volumes down hurt that a little bit too. But, yes, we're keeping an eye on that. A lot of initiatives to work on that as well. And that's in our plan. Jim Squires : Brain, we recognize that we have some ground to make up when it comes to fuel efficiency. Running bigger, heavier trains as a result of TOP21 implementation, very late in the second quarter, early in the third quarter should help with our overall fuel efficiency. And in addition, as Mike mentioned, we have numerous initiatives in the energy management area that we believe will result in an improvement in fuel efficiency going forward. Brian Ossenbeck : And with the conversion of the locomotive fleet that you see would that be a step change in that function as well? Jim Squires : That will help. Mike Wheeler : Yes, it is necessarily it's a step change because this is something that we're going to do over the next several years, but it does help because you're able to handle more tonnage with fewer locomotives. Brian Ossenbeck : Okay, thanks. And then just a quick follow-up for Cindy. Can you give us an update on the head count guidance for the year? I think last time I heard it was down at least 500 for the year. It seems like it's moving along pretty well, but the mix maybe a little bit different with the trainees coming out first and then considering we're looking at a fully loaded comp with land sale gains to get it at last this quarter. What's the outlook for land sales kind of all in, when you look at the back half of the year? Thank you. Cindy Earhart : Well in terms of head count, you're exactly right. I mean we guided to at least 500 down by the end of the year, compared to the end of the year in 2018. And as I said, we're already down 1,200 sequentially from the first quarter. We aren't guiding to a specific headcount number, but as I mentioned previously, we do expect that headcount is going to continue to come down as we've \u2013 we reduce work associated with TOP21. We're going to be looking at all areas of the company, mechanical, G&A all of those areas as we continue to push on the productivity. In terms of land sales in operating property, I think we had guided to between $80 million and $100 million with gains for a year and I think that's still a \u2013 I'm sorry, $30 million to $40 million \u2013 hold on one second. $50 million for the year. I'm sorry. And that's still a good guidance for the year. Jim Squires : Now, Brian, the item you mentioned was in other income was actually a non-operating item and there we did incur a loss... Cindy Earhart : We did. Jim Squires : As a result of marking down certain assets. Cindy, why don't you explain what was going on with that? Cindy Earhart : Yes, we did call out the $28 million loss that was related to some of our natural resource assets, that really relates to one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries Pocahontas Land Corporation, which has been part of our company for \u2013 since the early 1900. As part of just continuing to look at our assets, we determine that that's really not a core asset to our business. And as we've looked at land and other assets that we've had over the years, we just felt like this was an asset that we didn't need to continue to have, it wasn't strategic. So, we decided that we would hold that subsidiary for sale and we wrote it down to fair market value. So, that's what the $28 million is. Brian Ossenbeck : Okay. Alright. Thanks for the clarity there. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott Group : Hi, thanks, good morning. So, when I look at the \u2013 I'm going to stick on labor. So, when headcount is down 5% sequentially, labor costs only down 2% sequentially and I get the issue of this trainees, I'm wondering if there's any severance as well in the quarter if you could say. Now, going forward, should we think about the headcount and the labor cost moving more in line with each other? Are the additional headcount reductions more on trainees or more regular employees? And then, so I know you're not giving a specific guidance on headcount, but now that we're through sort of TOP21 and that volumes are weak, do you think we could see a similar reduction in headcount in the second half as what we saw in the first half sequentially? So, a bunch there. Jim Squires : Cindy? Cindy Earhart : Yes, Scott. In terms of \u2013 your first question was, in terms of severance. And there really hasn't been any severance related to the reduction of that headcount. Going forward in terms of the mix of employees that will be coming out is yes, it's more of the \u2013 of what you consider sort of average compensation that you've seen. We've got the conductor trainees, we got out early. So, you'll see more of a normalized comp coming out associated with the headcount that comes out going forward. Jim Squires : And a little bit of that other came out near the end of the quarter. Cindy Earhart : Yes, exactly. I said about half of that was really related to trainees, about your last question Scott was... Scott Group : Just given now that we're through TOP21 and given the sort of the weak volume trends. Can we see similar sequential reductions in headcount in the second half to what we saw in the first half, similar? Cindy Earhart : I would say that we \u2013 as I said before, we're going to continue to bring the headcount down in the T&E side around the work that's going away reducing the train starts. I mean there will be headcount associated with that as well as in other areas, but I've not giving specific guidance on headcount numbers. And we're going to push as hard as we can on that. Jim Squires : Scott, whether it's additional headcount reductions, whether it's the other things that I mentioned in my opening statement, cost savings and serving the yards local operations, locomotive maintenance, we will push as hard as we possibly can on the efficiency and productivity in the second half and we have a lots of opportunities that we're working on as Mike went through earlier as well. Scott Group : Jim last quarter you said let's get through TOP21 and then we can talk about yard rationalizations. Can you give us an update on what you're planning to do there? And then just as I think about the model like sometimes third quarter margins better than second, sometimes not. Do you think we can get sequential margin improvement in 3Q versus 2Q? Jim Squires : Let's start with the yard network. We've already converted two hump yards to flat switch operations coming out of TOP21. And we'll continue to look things over. It really depends on the level of volume under the new plan that's moving through a given yard. Once that volume drops below a certain level, it makes sense to convert to a flat switch operation, as long as you're going to keep it open. But we'll continue to work on that. There may be other opportunities around the network, in addition we're looking over our entire portfolio of local serving yards to see what fits well with TOP21 and what doesn't. In terms of the trend in the operating ratio, again, at least 100 basis points improvement for the full-year versus 2018, fully loaded, that's our goal. And we're confident we can meet it. Scott Group : Okay. Can I just ask you one last one real quick? You talked about coal RPU being pressured. Was that a comment that you think full year RPU is lower, was that second half lower year-over-year or is that just sequential, I want to put some context around what you said? Alan Shaw : Yes, Scott, look at the second half of the year. Last year as commodity prices ran up, we were able to increase our pricing on our metallurgical export market. Now, commodity prices are declining. I think the latest I saw was about $178 a metric ton where we were over $200 this time last year, and that's going to put pressure on the pricing in the metallurgical export market. And then overall, Scott, as you know the API 2 remains really weak, it's difficult for US suppliers to participate in that market, unless they're hedged, and so I think that's going to have a negative impact on thermal volumes in the second half of the year. Scott Group : Alright, thanks for the time guys. Operator : Next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Tom Wadewitz : Yes. Good morning. I wanted to \u2013 maybe a quick follow-on the questions on export coal, and now a bit on TOP21. I apologize if I missed this. There were some overlapping calls, but what do you think on full-year tons for export coal. Did you give a comment on where you expect that to be? Alan Shaw : No, Tom, I did not give guidance on that. I'm calling for export coal volumes to decline year-over-year in the second half of the year pressured in the thermal markets. And then you heard \u2013 you just heard the commentary on pricing as well. Tom Wadewitz : Sure. What was the full year mix of thermal and met in your export in 2018? And what did that look like in the second quarter? Alan Shaw : Generally, it runs about 55% to 65% is mat and we were in that ballpark in the second quarter. Similar to where we were last year. Tom Wadewitz : Okay. But... Alan Shaw : The mats team mix was pretty consistent. We had a little bit more mix towards Baltimore in the second quarter of this year. Tom Wadewitz : I mean given \u2013 yes, given the comment on, it seems like there \u2013 you would expect more pressure on thermal export than on [met export]? Is that the right way to think about it? And does that show up in worse kind of \u2013 or maybe a different mix and sequential decline in second half or how do you \u2013 I guess I'm trying to resolve the comment on weakness in thermal, but the mix not changing. Alan Shaw : Overall, I think you're right in terms of pressure on thermal volumes and then pressure on metallurgical pricing. Tom Wadewitz : Okay. Alan Shaw : And the mix is going to shift in that band that I just gave you. Tom Wadewitz : Right. Okay. And then a question on TOP21. The framework that you've talked about I think Jim has been along the lines of, we want to execute on the plan, make sure it works, before we take resources out. And I just wanted to get your sense of, is that still the right way to think about it that you've got some amount of resource in the system that you will give a bit more time before you take it out or you've seen enough that you \u2013 it's running well, and you can pretty quickly start taking out the resource whether that's head count more locomotives whatever would be? Jim Squires : Well look, let me start by saying, we made great progress on resources in the second quarter. Even before we flip the switch on TOP21. So, we got a running start on this. But to answer your question, yes, absolutely, we see further opportunities to reduce resources in all of the ways in which we've already discussed this morning. And now the TOP21 has been implemented and the network is running well and its aftermath. We're going to go after the resources. Tom Wadewitz : Okay. So, you don't need further time to assess success you say, okay it's working and we can go after it right now? Jim Squires : That's correct. Once the work is \u2013 once the work is gone, we take the resources out. Tom Wadewitz : Right, okay. Good. Well, congratulations on the launch on TOP21, and thanks for the time. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Justin Long : Thanks, and good morning. So, I wanted to start with TOP21 and wanted to get some help understanding that different iterations of the plan. So, Phase 1 is under way. It sounds like Phase 2 starts at the beginning of next year, but when will the implementation process be complete across the entire network. And in terms of how this plan impacts the OR, should we be expecting more of an OR benefit in the early stages of TOP21 or the later stages of TOP21? Jim Squires : Good morning, Justin. As we laid out at Investor Day, we will follow the initial implementation of TOP21 with further refinements. Now, the first target of opportunity will be additional benefits, operational benefits within the remaining merchandise bulk commodities that can be further consolidated into the TOP21 Version 1 operating plan. So, Mike, why don't you elaborate on that? Mike Wheeler : Yes. So, he almost wants to call it 2.0 of what we implemented. It's gone very well. So, we're taking a look at what are the next opportunities. We talked about how we made a big effort to add more distributed power trains. We did that, but we also knew there was more opportunity behind that. And that's what we're looking at now. So, there'll be some minor iterations of this current plan that we'll model and put in place, add more distributed power that will give us more benefits as well. So, we're kind of taking the opportunity to harvest everything we can find, as we get better and better with this plan and concurrently start working on the next plan. Jim Squires : And in terms of the pace of our improvement as we have said in 2019 at least to 100 basis points over 2018 and 60 by 2021. Justin Long : Okay. And secondly, maybe this is one for Mike. I heard you give some numbers on the number of railcars that have been put into storage, but any update in terms of where we are in rationalizing the size of the locomotive fleet. I know you're always make adjustments based on demand, but based on the current freight market and volume environment that we're seeing, can you talk about where your active locomotive fleet is today versus what you would consider to be an optimal level? Mike Wheeler : Yes, okay. So, we've got about 550 locomotives that we have stored that are available as needed, and I'll remind you that we also sold about 150 units that we've pulled out over the last years as well. So, that's where we're at. So, it's pretty big reduction from the fleet. And as part of what we've talked about taking a look at how the TOP21 plan is working, as well as looking at our yard in local network there is more to come. And we're working on that right now. Justin Long : Okay. I'll leave it at that. Thanks for the time. Operator : The next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Amit Mehrotra : Thanks. I just wanted to come back to the yield-up discussion, if I could. Jim, when you and the management team unveiled it back in February you and other executives called it an aggressive, but achievable plan, and that was when mid-single digit volume declines were not really kind of in the \u2013 on the horizon so to speak. So, I just wondered if you could talk about how that's impacting if at all the pace in magnitude of the yield-up strategy, I guess over the last few months you've also had a little bit more STB rumblings with respective to some of the ancillary revenue changes that are trying \u2013 aimed to changed behavior with respect to PSR? Jim Squires : I'll let Alan weigh in here, but let me say that the price increases we have taken and expect to take in the future are based on the value of the service we are providing our customer service with which they in turn can create value in their businesses. So, that's the basis of the price increases and the service is at a very high level and that has enabled us to take the pricing up. Alan your thoughts. Alan Shaw : It's foundational to what we're doing. Our approach is balanced strategy of converting a great service product in both revenue growth and productivity and you're seeing that in our results. And as I noted, we had just had our second-best quarter of year-over-year pricing increases in the last seven years, and within our merchandise network we've had seven consecutive quarters of improving year-over-year pricing increases. Customers see the improvement in our service product. They know that we're collaborating with them on our changes to our operating plan, they\u2019re part of the discussion and they\u2019re part of the process and they also know that we're providing them with a platform for growth. And so, they want a sustainable supply chain partner that's going to give them the opportunity to grow in the future. Amit Mehrotra : Right. Yes, no, that makes total sense. And if I could just follow-up on that precise point. There is \u2013 from the pricing perspective, there\u2019s only one rail that we can actually truly kind of calculate what's being realized solely on price or core price. One of the proxy metrics we use at least and this could be wrong or not is revenue per revenue ton-mile, which I think we look at as a proxy for price, so if I look at it on that metric the growth in revenue per revenue ton miles for the company was up about 5% in the second quarter. It actually decelerated from 6% in the first quarter. So, first, is that the right way, we should be measuring your progress with respect to the yield-up plan. And then, if so, can we expect maybe greater gains in that metric as you guys get further along in the process? Alan Shaw : Amit, that's a proxy for that. It also, as you know the denominator is influenced by circuity and with the TOP21 plan, we're going to benefit from that. Amit Mehrotra : Okay. Alright, thanks guys for taking my questions. Operator : The next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions. Chris Wetherbee : Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to kind of come back to some of the commentary around second quarter operating performance relative to maybe what we can expect post the TOP21 rollout and maybe as we move forward through the PSR plan towards the 2021 targets. Conceptually, if you think about the second half of the year, should we assume that there is maybe incremental operating leverage that you can capture relative to the first half of the year as you've made the big strides on the headcount reductions, but your outlook for sort of volume, maybe a little bit better in the third quarter and fourth quarter and clearly the yield side still remains reasonably strong. I just wanted to get a rough sense that I know the 100 basis points is the target for this year. But when you think about sort of first half versus second half, it seems fair to assume that you might be able to pick up a little bit operating leverage in the back half? Jim Squires : We did see significant operating leverage in the first half and we expect that trend to continue with our emphasis on pricing to the value of our service, with targeted growth opportunities, modest growth opportunities, but some tailwind there as well. So, you roll it all up for the full-year and we believe that we can achieve that at least 100 basis points improvement on the operating ratio versus last year. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. Maybe, Alan, a question on the Intermodal side. Just wanted to get a sense, I mean, you made some positive commentary around Intermodal and obviously some of that's probably coming from the channel partners. When you think about your book of business stuff, you need to call off the network maybe some lane selection that you need to do. How far along are you on that process? Do you see more incrementally more or less as you move into the back half of the year? I just going to thinking about that in the context of maybe of somewhat better Intermodal outlook for the back half of the year, or at least maybe consistently strong for the back half of the year? Alan Shaw : Well, Chris lane rationalization for Norfolk Southern is an ongoing process. We have done it every year since 2013, and last year we were able to deliver 18% revenue growth with [rail] rationalization on top of 11% revenue growth in 2017. We are committed to doing this in collaboration with our channel partners and providing them with sufficient notice, so that they can plan accordingly with their customers. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. So, but incrementally first half is just on ongoing process, we shouldn't be thinking about it as sort of more or less relative what we've seen so far in 2019? Alan Shaw : Typically, we had \u2013 we operate with these \u2013 or we execute these changes in advance of bid season at the beginning of the year. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. That's helpful. Thanks very much. I appreciate it. Alan Shaw : Again, Chris, it's to make sure that we're collaborating with our customers. Chris Wetherbee : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is from the line of David Vernon with AllianceBernstein. Please proceed with your question. David Vernon : Hi, good morning guys. Alan, I just wanted to follow-up on the confidence around the volume growth coming back in Intermodal in the back half of the year. Is that based on \u2013 so your expectation that the truck market starts to firm up or is there some visibility you have in terms of share shifts within the smaller domestic market, which is going to get you back to growth? Alan Shaw : It's based on the overall macro environment. We're not \u2013 it's based on conversations with channel partners. You're starting to see some improvement in spot rates, maybe we're at an inflection point. So, that's our read, and once again it's modest, and however, recognize that our international volumes continue to grow. So, when we improve our domestic volumes, then it could easily turn into growth within the overall Intermodal franchise. Once again, we've got the best Intermodal franchise in the east. And so, we're going to be at the forefront of that growth. David Vernon : And I guess as you think about within the environment right now being a little bit softer on the truck rates side, I think some of the Intermodal providers are talking about how there are lanes where truck is actually priced under [the order door] Intermodal. Is there anything you guys need to do on the pricing side, to get that growth back? Or do you feel like you can kind of yield-up into this softer truck market and still get a volume growth? Alan Shaw : Yes, we're very pleased with the outcome of the bid season in terms of the rate increases we were able to achieve. Once again it reflects the value of our product and it reflects the strength of our Intermodal franchise. We've got a great franchise, it's a point-to-point franchise, which frankly means, we don't have to make a lot of adjustments to it. There is some cyclicality in the truck market and you can find some lanes out there where the spot rate is under Intermodal. However, we're not going to chase that. We're going to continue to price long term to the value of our product and we've got long-term relationships with our channel partners. They understand that. David Vernon : Alright. Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question. Jason Seidl : Thank you, operator. Good morning, gentlemen. I'll stick with Intermodal here as well. Can you talk a little bit about the upcoming peak season? Do you expect sort of a normalized peak? And then on the international side, obviously a lot of growth coming there. How much of that growth do you think is just sort of East Coast share wins versus the West Coast or maybe that you just won some business versus your competitor in the East? Alan Shaw : I think we're looking for a normalized peak, our channel partners are anticipating volumes will start to pick up in August. On the international side, we've got great alignment with the steamship lines that are adding capacity to the East Coast. And that's driving a lot of our growth. Jason Seidl : Okay. Makes sense. And I have a quick question, you mentioned flooding in KC, I think you said guys said, your line was out for more than a month. I don't seem to recall you mentioning any cost associated with that line being out, I was wondering if you can give us a little more meat on the bone there? Jim Squires : The impact on expenses was immaterial. We did have some additional capital costs associated with the flooding. Cindy order of magnitude. Cindy Earhart : Yes, I would just repeat that that we obviously there were costs associated with it, but it was primarily capital and on the expense side, it was not material expenses. Jason Seidl : Okay. Appreciate the color. Thanks for the time as always. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Walter Spracklin : Yes, thanks very much. Good morning everyone. So, I wanted to come back to the overall volume inflection, positive growth in each of the metrics on the top line, you're mentioning. And I'm seeing minus 4%, obviously minus 4% volume down in the second quarter, you're carload data to-date is I know early in the quarter but minus 7%, I just got to go back perhaps Alan to the question about what are you hearing, and it seems to be across the board in each of that \u2013 each of your segments that are trending down here so far in the third quarter there. What are you hearing from your customers to suggest that not only is minus 7% going to stop dropping, but you're going to see, in fact enough growth to swing you back into the positive territory for the rest of the year or is it any one commodity? Is it a big share win that you've got and secured and you can see in the back half? Just a little bit of color on that would be great. Alan Shaw : Walter, we are targeting growth in the second half of the year. The majority of that growth will occur in the fourth quarter as I noted in my prepared remarks. Conversations with our customers I just talked with Jason about what we're hearing from our channel partners within Intermodal. And then in the merchandise network we see the crude price differentials creating the opportunity for growth in the second half of the year, because of our flawless implementation of TOP21. We've got the capacity dividend to apply to that. We see improved service, which will allow continued growth in aggregates. We're looking for more normalized shipping patterns within our frac sand markets and U.S. vehicle production is \u2013 light vehicle production, pardon me, is projected to increase by 3% in the second half of the year. And we serve more U.S. Auto build production than any other railroad in North America. Our read of the tape is that that's going to offset some declines, where you fully expect to see declines in NGLs, we expect to see pressure within our export coal market as I noted earlier and the metals market has been weakened by low commodity prices, although we're starting to see price increases for hot rolled coil steel take effect and stick. Jim Squires : So, for all the reasons Alan has mentioned Walter, we do expect growth, volume and revenue growth \u2013 modest volume and revenue growth in the second half. We're all about pursuing the efficiencies that we have uncovered as a result of Clean Sheeting and TOP21 as well. We'll continue to push on all of those opportunities hard in the second quarter, even as we go after the growth that we can find. Walter Spracklin : And that's great color. I appreciate that Alan and Jim, thanks for that color. And that leads me to my second question. When I look at your TOP21 and kind of compare it to past iterations to PSR. When I look at the 100 basis points that you're guiding to for this year, [60 for 2021], it's a little different from PSR right? I mean PSR is front-end weighted, big reductions in OR and then those are reductions taper off as we get through the plan. What yours suggest is that you're looking for 100 basis points this year, but then accelerating to 220 per year in the next couple of years and that's why I'm struggling a little bit, if you can tie TOP21 in to show why operating ratio is in fact going to double in its pace of improvement in 2020 and 2021 to get to that 60% target, certainly will be helpful. Alan Shaw : Well, there is more to come. And as we laid out at Investor Day, this will be an iterative network planning process and there will be additional phases of operating plan change and optimization coming. Those will be the basis for further operating ratio improvements, as well as the growth that we can manage for the duration of the planned period into 2021. Walter Spracklin : Will you be providing guidance again like you did this year for 2020 operating ratio as you get into the 2020 period? Jim Squires : Well, we'll see. I would certainly expect us to update you on the productivity and SDI service delivery index goals that we laid out for you. We will give you new goals, which are in turn linked to the operational and financial improvements we expect to drive. Walter Spracklin : That's great. Okay, thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question. Bascome Majors : Yes. Volume was down year-over-year in the quarter, but revenue was still up slightly, and margins expanded about a point to drive the income up 4%. Excuse me, operating income. But if you look beyond the financials, the operating metrics were up a lot more, velocity up 20%, dwell down close to 40%. Why aren't we seeing more costs fall out of the system from this more fluid network. I mean, is this temporal challenge is like the stock comp benefit you had last year that hurt the year-over-year comparison in labor? Or is it just a situation that investor expectations around how quickly we're going to see stair-step margin improvement in NS, are those just too high early on here? Thanks. Jim Squires : We did see TOP21 driven expense improvements in second quarter as Cindy went through in labor, in materials and equipment rents and we would expect those savings to continue and to accelerate in the balance of the year. Now, in the second quarter, those favorable expense trends were offset in certain cases by the comparison to last year. For example, the employment tax refund, we booked in the second quarter of last year, and there were some other things as well. For example, in materials and other that masked the improvements in materials expense. Going forward, we do expect to see additional TOP21 driven savings in all of those categories. Bascome Majors : Thank you for that. Jim. And last one, I believe it was Slide 10 where you lay out your KPIs, a reiteration of what you talked about the Investor Day with 2019 goals and 2021 goals. You gave some directional commentary about where you're tracking mid-2019, but you don't have hard metrics on the slide. Can you give a little more color about the degree of progress we've made toward the bridge from 2018 to 2019 goals? What looks like a lay-up and what's a bit more stretch from where we see today? Thank you. Jim Squires : Yes. Thank you, Mike why don't you go through your commentary again on each of those goals. Mike Wheeler : Yes. So, the service delivery index were as we noted were trending ahead of that and we are on track to exceed the goal. Same thing with T&E and productivity, we're trending ahead of that as well. And so, we feel comfortable about that. Train weight, we talked about it being back-end loaded and as we implement the new TOP21 plan we see some improvements there. We're already seeing some in general merchandise. Locomotive productivity, we are on track to meet or exceed and Cars-on-Line we are exceeding and will be exceeding for the year. Bascome Majors : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of [KARRIN Russo] with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good morning guys. So, just quickly on some housekeeping items. So, the tax rate came in a little lower than what we had been looking for this quarter. Maybe you could talk about if there was something unique about this quarter and what the expectation might be for the second half and then also if you could give the number on real estate gains for the quarter? Jim Squires : Cindy? Cindy Earhart : Effective tax rate was 22.7%, which had some benefits in two pieces really. One, being the benefits of stock-based compensation that hit the quarter. And then secondly, the returns on corporate-owned life insurance. For the full-year, we're expecting that the effective tax rate will be between 23% and 24%. And in terms of real estate sales on operating property, they were not [significant]. We already \u2013 we called out there was non-operating property sales of \u2013 I guess was around $10 million. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Okay, that's helpful. And then just I wanted to return to this OR question and I feel like maybe we've beat it to death a little bit, but you guys had set out efficiency targets obviously, at the Analyst Day and it feels like volumes have come in a little bit weaker than what most people would have expected, maybe if you could just talk about the extent to which you see your cost structure as moving in tandem with what volumes are because it feels like certainly on OR and also on headcount, you're trending well ahead of your full-year targets, at least through the first half. Should we expect some moderation in the pace of those gains, because it feels like it would be the opposite given kind of the implementation of TOP21 now just starting up in July. Maybe you could talk about the extent to which you see that cost structure is variable with volumes? Jim Squires : We created ratio based KPIs that Mike has been through. In order to keep us focused on productivity relative to GTMs on the network that was the basic rationale for setting forth our KPIs in that way. And that's why we remain focused on and we're making progress. We're winning there because as Mike went through, we have generated or are close to generating the types of results that will at least meet or exceed the target ratios for 2019. So, we are adjusting the resources in light of the volume trend, thus the intense focus on productivity and efficiency and all of the different areas we've been through. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Thanks. Thanks for the time. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. And I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Jim Squires for closing comments. Jim Squires : Thank you very much everyone for your time and attention this morning. We appreciate your questions, and we look forward to talking with you next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may now disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Pete Sharbel, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Sharbel, you may begin. Pete Sharbel : Thank you, Melissa, and good morning. Before we begin, please note that during today's call, we may make certain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and may differ materially from actual results. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. The slides of the presenters are available on our website at norfolksouthern.com in the Investors section, along with our non-GAAP reconciliation. Additionally, a transcript and downloads will be posted after the call. Now, it's my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's Chairman, President and CEO, Jim Squires. Jim Squires : Good morning everyone, and welcome to Norfolk Southern's Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Alan Shaw, Chief Marketing Officer; Mike Wheeler, Chief Operating Officer; and Cindy Earhart, Chief Financial Officer. Turning to our financial results for the third quarter. Income from operations was approximately $1 billion , net income was $657 million, EPS was 249 and the operating ratio improved to 64.9%. These results include the unfavorable impact of a $32 million write-off of a receivable resulting from a legal dispute, which affected the OR by 110 basis points and EPS for $0.09. As highlighted on Slide 4, these were record results including a record third quarter and year-to-date OR. Earlier this year, we outlined a dynamic flexible new operating plan, TOP21, capable of creating value in all market conditions. In the months since, particularly in the second half of this year, volumes across the transportation sector, including our volumes, turned sharply lower. In response, leveraging TOP21, our team doubled down on productivity and achieved major resource reductions. For example, in the third quarter, we reduced crew starts and increased by 11% year-over-year. That was nearly double the rate of the volume decline, driving a 9% decrease in employment levels. Following the first phase of TOP21, we swiftly moved to Phase II, which includes refinement of our guarding local trains, deployment of additional distributed power on long trains and blending of intermodal and unit trains into existing trains wherever feasible. These efforts are producing further reductions in crew starts, circuity and road train miles. And we've begun Clean Sheeting our intermodal terminals and preparing for the third phase of TOP21 using the formula we used to successfully overhaul the carload network while sustaining a high level of network performance and service. Earlier in the year, I spoke about the momentum building across our organization and our commitment to enhancing operational and financial outcomes. This commitment is evidenced by significant expense reduction so far this year, which Cindy will describe in more detail later in the call. With revenue trending below our expectations in the second half and some unusual costs expected in the fourth quarter, we continue to expect operating ratio improvement for the full year, but that improvement now seems likely to be less than our earlier forecast of at least 100 basis points. Nevertheless, we remain confident we can achieve our goal of a 60% OR by 2021 through additional cost structural changes and future revenue growth. For example, we are pursuing savings opportunities in fuel, mechanical and other aspects of operations about which Mike will speak shortly. And we continue to drive bottom line improvement with pricing increases, commensurate with the value of our service with the results evident in the third quarter and year-to-date in revenue-per-unit and revenue-per-revenue ton-mile trends. Alan will speak further about those trends in a minute. All of us at Norfolk Southern are committed to transforming our Company to drive shareholder value creation. As I've said before, we are embracing new ideas and positioning leaders throughout the organization who are Champions for Change. We are all working hard to operate as safely and efficiently as possible and deliver what we promised to our customers and shareholders. The results so far this year. Improved service levels for our customers, a lower operating ratio and bottom line growth, and the return of nearly $2.3 billion to shareholders. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Alan. Alan Shaw : Thank you, Jim, and good morning everyone. In the third quarter, we continued our focus on pricing to the value of our service product and delivering productivity gains, generating a record third quarter operating ratio despite difficult economic conditions. Trade uncertainly continue to influence the economic environment, which coupled with lower spot truck and commodity pricing negatively impacted volume during the quarter. As we cycle through the headwinds associated with the market, we have and will maintain our focus on margin improvement driven by price, service and productivity, while collaborating with our customers to provide a platform for growth. As shown on Slide 6, a 6% decline in volume led to a 4% revenue decline in the quarter. Increased revenue per unit, which has improved year-over-year for 11 consecutive quarters, partially offset the volume decrease. A consistent delivery of RPU growth highlights the effectiveness of our pricing strategy. Third quarter revenue in our merchandise segment was flat year-over-year, as continued strength in pricing offset volume declines. Volume declined 4% resulting from reduced steel and natural gas shipments, while favorable fuel price differentials drove gains in crude oil, the East Coast refineries. During the quarter, we experienced growth in automotive and aggregates as a result of increased production at [indiscernible] auto plants and improved service respectively. Intermodal revenue declined 5% due to reduced volume in our domestic franchise. Strong relationships with steamship lines and share shifts at the East Coast ports produced international volume growth year-over-year. Domestic intermodal declined due to lower spot truck pricing and a weakened manufacturing environment. Intermodal arc of yield was flat in the quarter as pricing increases were offset by the negative mix impact of increased international volume and lower fuel surcharge revenue. Turning to coal, revenue was down 13% in the third quarter. Our utility portfolio was impacted by additional natural gas capacity and prices that suppressed coal burn. Export thermal and metallurgical prices remain at low levels, making it difficult for U.S. coals to compete globally. Improved pricing drove our revenue-per-unit increase of 2%. Moving to Slide 7. We expect the same factors affecting third quarter volumes to persist in the fourth quarter. Macroeconomic conditions, tariff uncertainty and global weakness continue to negatively influence business investment, manufacturing and exports. Lower commodity pricing will impact many of our markets, including coal and steel. Truck loadings are expected to be flat for the rest of 2019 with excess capacity keeping spot truck rates low. While we expect a challenging economic environment for the remainder of the year, we remain focused on our strategic plan to drive margin improvement. We are collaborating with our customers daily to fine-tune our service product and identify long-term growth opportunities. Our strategic plan is producing pricing and efficiency gains, and we are fully committed to the execution of the plan while meeting our customers' expectations and establishing a platform for future profitable growth. I will now turn it over to Mike for an update on operations. Mike Wheeler : Thank you, Alan. Today, I will update you on the state of our operations and the efficiencies we are creating with our TOP21 plan. In the third quarter, we delivered strong service for our customers, made further progress on the next iteration of TOP21, and began implementing initiatives in TOP21 Phase II on a rolling basis. Our operational momentum is driving significant cost savings and we are flexing our dynamic plan in accordance with market conditions. We continue realizing efficiencies while providing a superior service product to our customers. Moving to Slide 9. We have continued our laser focus on the execution of our plan and principles of precision scheduled railroading. We substantially improved train speed and terminal dwell compared to last year and delivered record quarterly performance. These achievements support our strategy to meet our customers' expectations while eliminating costs and prudently managing our assets. The operation continues to be resilient as evidenced by our ability to work through two recent major incidents in the fourth quarter, a bridge outage and a large derailment, with minimal disruption to our customer supply chains. This shows the strong resiliency of our operating model. These overall results are due to relentless execution by our operations team and other employees supporting them. We want to thank our field employees for their unwavering focus on safety, service and efficiency. Turning to our service and productivity metrics on Slide 10. These metrics align with our strategic plan as they measure key productivity and customer service levels. We have been aggressively reducing our resources to meet our productivity goals, account GTMs dropping by 9% in the quarter. Consistent with prior quarters, the blue bars represent our goals for 2019. Starting with the Service Delivery Index, which is the on-time delivery performance of our scheduled shipments indexed to 2018. This is a customer-facing metric that combines intermodal availability and shipment consistency, which measures trip plan adherence for general merchandise as well as automotive traffic. Strong service performance continued in the third quarter and we expect to drive further improvement. We are trending ahead of where we thought we would be with our T&E productivity goal for 2019. And we anticipate this trend will continue for the remainder of the year. We are at our lowest T&E headcount on record, having reduced by 14% versus third quarter 2018, while still providing exceptional service. We are already realizing the benefits of our TOP21 plan. The results are driving the comp and benefit improvements, to which Cindy will speak. As mentioned during the last call, we are continuing to work on improving our train weight. The majority of our goal was back-end loaded, as the first phase of the TOP21 operating plan was successfully implemented on July 1st. We are seeing improvements in our general merchandise train weights, which were offset by headwinds associated with intermodal and coal volumes. Locomotive productivity continues to be an important metric for NS. We are tracking to meet our goal for this year. We have been rationalizing our locomotive fleet, which is 22% lower than the same period last year. We also have an aggressive initiative to rationalize resources associated with the maintenance of these wealth of others, including a reduction of 525 positions already this year. We will continue to focus on the remaining resources required to maintain this lower fleet size. And the Cars-On-Line, which is down 20% versus our 2018 baseline, continues to trend very positively. Thanks to our fast and consistent service product. This includes cars in storage, which can be deployed as market conditions warrant. Turning to our progress on our TOP21 operating plan on Slide 11. As you may recall, our operating plan has four major objectives; operate as one network, execute a balanced train plan between terminals, serve our customers frequently, and reduce dependence on major terminals. The first phase of TOP21 primarily focused on our general merchandise bulk and automotive business and was successfully implemented on July 1st. We have been aggressively implementing the next phase, which has an added emphasis on distributed power to drive further train consolidations. We have increased the number of DP trains per day by more than two-and-a-half times with the expansion of this initiative since our TOP21 rollout. We will continue to add DP trains across the network, which will have the benefit of improving train length and fuel efficiency. Regarding fuel efficiency, we have several other initiatives for improvement. Specifically, one, ensuring a healthy energy management lead locomotive; two, compliance with horsepower-per-ton procedures; and three, compliance with usage of energy management technology. We are also syncing up our local schedule and the new train plan. We are implementing these changes on a rolling basis and driving significant structural improvements. Specifically, total circuity for general merchandise and auto traffic is down 27% versus pre-TOP21 and road train miles are down 13%. Additionally, we have been working to calibrate our local plan to maximize efficiency while continuing to provide good service to our customers. Together, these changes have helped to continue drive down crew starts while keeping velocity and customer service high. We have also begun the process of Clean Sheeting our intermodal terminals and preparing for the third phase of TOP21, which remodels all traffic for additional opportunities. This will drive further cost and resource reductions and improve our fuel efficiency. I will now turn it over to Cindy, who will cover our financials. Cindy Earhart : Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin with our operating results from Slide 13. The continued execution of our strategic plan is delivering tangible results that are flowing through to the bottom line. The structural changes we are making, including the implementation of our PSR-based operating plan, generated expense savings in compensation and benefits and equipment rents. These savings as well as lower fuel prices more than offset the decline in revenues. However, in the third quarter, we wrote off a $32 million receivable as a result of a legal dispute, which added 110 basis points to the operating ratio and lowered earnings per share by $0.09. Income from railway operations for the quarter was nearly $1 billion and we reduced our third quarter operating ratio by 50 basis points, achieving a third quarter record of 64.9%. Moving to Slide 14. We are delivering cost savings as evident in the $82 million decline in operating expenses. Our new operating plans have resulted in fewer trains on the network and reduced crew starts. Compensation and benefits expense declined as a result of a $47 million in savings due to lower employee levels and reduced overtime and recruit. We drove average headcount down by approximately 1,000 employees from last quarter and have reduced headcount by 2400 compared to last year. We also remain intensely focused on improving asset utilization. By increasing the velocity of our network and improving fluidity, we have significantly reduced the need for locomotives and freight cars, resulting in equipment rental savings of $35 million. We also achieved savings of $10 million in material expense due to fewer locomotives and service and freight cars online. Partially offsetting the efficiency gains that we delivered in the quarter was the $32 million write-off that I previously mentioned. We also experienced $17 million of additional expense due to increased pay rates. Finally, lower fuel price and a decrease in consumption drove the $48 million decline in fuel expense. Fuel efficiency continues to be an area of focus, and we know there are opportunities to generate savings through improved efficiency. Slide 15 summarizes our third quarter results. Income from railway operations was slightly under last year's record, and non-operating items added an additional $16 million of expense. Third quarter net income was $657 million and diluted earnings per share was $2.49. Recapping our year-to-date cash flows on Slide 16. Cash from operating activities was $3 billion, and free cash flow for the first nine months was $1.5 billion. We continue to return capital to shareholders, as evidenced by the 9% increase in the quarterly dividend we announced in July. Dividends and share repurchases totaled almost $2.3 billion for the first nine months. As we head towards the conclusion of the year, I want to highlight a few specific items that will impact the fourth quarter. First, starting with headcount, we expect a continuation of position reductions in the fourth quarter. By year-end, we expect headcount to approximate 23,300, which is a reduction of over 3200 positions compared to the same time last year. Also, we expect incentive compensation to be favorable over prior year, but the magnitude will depend upon our full-year results. However, as Mike mentioned earlier, there have been some specific incidents in the fourth quarter that will result in incremental expenses. We expect additional costs associated with future in trains due to a bridge outage and lighting damage resulting from a large derailment will approximate $25 million in additional expenses. Additionally, we expect that gains associated with the sales of operating property will be lower than last year. You recall, the fourth quarter of 2018 included $145 million in gains on the sale of operating properties whereas, we expect the current quarter to be about one-third of that. The execution of our strategic plan is delivering results and even in the face of obstacles unforeseen at the outset of this year, we are confident we will improve our full-year operating ratio in 2019 and achieve our goal of 60% by 2021. We are seeing the benefits associated with our new operating plan. We are actively identifying and implementing further measures that will produce improved financial results and drive shareholder value. Thank you for your attention. And I'll turn the call back over to Jim. Jim Squires : Thank you, Cindy. As we've outlined, and as our third quarter results demonstrate, we continue to build momentum by executing planned initiatives and pushing well beyond many of the goals we set out earlier this year. We are hard at work preparing for the third phase of TOP21, rightsizing our local and yard operations, further consolidating road trains, and going after cost savings in fuel and mechanical operations. While pursuing all of these efforts, the Norfolk Southern team continues to provide superior service to our customers, enabling us to price to our value in the marketplace while ensuring that we are positioned at the leading edge of growth when it returns. These actions give us confidence, we will reach a 60% operating ratio by 2021. Before we open the call for Q&A, I do want to recognize Cindy for her 34 years of service to Norfolk Southern and her support to her final date here at the Company on November 1st. I highly value the role she has played in pioneering new technologies at our Company, developing our strategic plans, and delivering shareholder returns. On behalf of the entire Board and Management team, I thank Cindy for her many contributions and wish her well in retirement. We'll now open the line for Q&A. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Justin Long : Thanks, good morning and congrats, Cindy, on the retirement. Maybe to start with the OR guidance for 2019, I just wanted to clarify something. Are you excluding the impact of the $32 million write-off in 3Q in that guidance? And then Cindy, you mentioned the $25 million of unusual cost in the fourth quarter. So I'm just curious that if you exclude that $32 million write-off and the $25 million of unusual items in the fourth quarter, if that OR guidance of at least 100 basis points that you previously put out there would have been achievable. Jim Squires : Justin, it's Jim. Let me see if I can clarify for you what we have said this morning. Our guidance is that we expect to achieve a full-year operating ratio improvement year-over-year, even with the additional expenses and the trend in revenue and even with the receivables write-off that we discussed earlier. But, also including those things, we do not expect to be able to hit our goal of at least 100 basis points improvement in the operating ratio. Now with that said, that does not diminish our confidence in any way that we can get to a 60% operating ratio by 2021. And to back that up, I just want to take a minute to recap what we have achieved to date. Because those achievements are the foundation of further improvements that we will make to get to the 60% operating ratio. And I'll just touch it again, on our operating plan. Because that, in many ways, is the bedrock of the improvements we have made and will continue to make. All right, Phase I. As of July 1, we cut over it seamless. We see an immediate reduction in train starts and active trains on the network as we have shown you previously. We see a sharp decline in crew starts as we showed you today. There is no disruption to service as a result of it, however. In Phase II, we pursue additional train consolidations. We blend more intermodal bulk and carload traffic. We accelerate distributed power. By now, we have more than doubled the number of DP trains per day operating on the network. We pursue further rationalization of equipment. We work to sync up the local operating plan, would give you network plan and that results in additional crew start reductions. As you can see on Slide 11, crew start reductions actually accelerate coming out of the initial cut-over as we move through Phase II. And then, if we pursue intermodal Clean Sheeting, the analog, if you will, to the Clean Sheeting we did in the merchandise network and we are hard at work on fuel efficiency initiatives, where we know we have some grounds to make up. So, these are the things we are operative today. In Phase III of TOP21, we will remodel all traffic to unlock additional efficiencies. Now, what has been the results in terms of resources of these various phases of TOP21. So, let's start with T&E productivity. As Mike mentioned, T&E down 13% versus third quarter of 2018, giving us the lowest T&E headcount on record for our company. In terms of locomotive productivity, we have reduced the number of locomotives out there by 22% versus last year. And that reduction in locomotives operating on the network, along with the reduction in Cars-On-Line, yielded an additional reduction of 525 mechanical positions already in this year, which together with the G&A reductions, which together with other employment reductions we have made, gave us 9% lower overall again in the third quarter with more decline in the fourth quarter. Cars-On-Line down 20% versus the 2018 benchmark, yielding significant equipment rent savings along with the locomotive reductions. Cindy went through the different expense categories; the compensation and benefit savings, the material savings, the equipment rent savings that were the result of these resource reductions. In TOP21 Phase III, there will be more of the same. We will see through additional train consolidations additional reductions in crew starts and we would expect to see T&E reductions follow. With continued rationalization of locomotive fleet, we will see lower maintenance spending and so on and so forth. And lastly, we will stay very focused on our pricing plan, our yield-up strategy which showed excellent results in the third quarter and for the full year-to-date. We are determined to price to the value of our service in the marketplace. Justin Long : That's great and comprehensive answer. I think, secondly, I just wanted to ask a bigger picture question. Obviously, we're dealing with a more challenging demand backdrop right now. As we think about that guidance to get to a 60% OR in 2021, do you think that's still achievable if the demand environment stays around current levels and the coal environment stays around current levels, or do we need to see a positive inflection and demand in order to hit that 60% OR? Jim Squires : We are determined to achieve the 60% OR goal by 2021 in any foreseeable revenue environment, including the one that we are in now. But yeah, ours is a balanced plan and we've said that all along; we are pursuing growth, we believe we will see the fruits of our efforts in the form of a resumption of growth during the remaining years of our current strategic plan. But if we don't, we will push even harder on efficiency measures, on productivity measures, to get to the 60% OR. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Allison Landry : So now that you're in Phase II of TOP21, and as you move into Phase III, should we start to expect at a meaningful acceleration in the year-over-year OR improvement. I guess, just as you're talking about all the trains you're eliminating and increasing train weights and adding the DPU, why wouldn't you be able to move below a 60% OR more quickly, as we've seen with many of your peers. Jim Squires : If we can get to 60% OR sooner, Allison, we will continue to push. We are determined to do all we can to generate shareholder value through growth and through a lower operating ratio. And 60% is our goal by 2021, if we can do better than that, we certainly will. Allison Landry : And then I was hoping maybe you could offer some thoughts on the recent addition to the Board by Claude Mongeau. What role would you expect him to play, and how is that materializing so far? Thank you. Jim Squires : Claude, as you know, brings a great deal of experience in our industry, having served as CEO of Canadian Natural. He brings in-depth knowledge of operations of railway finances. He served as CN CFO for a number of years and so, he is a most-welcome addition to our Board. We are looking forward to having him advice and counsel us as we pursue all of the initiatives that we intend to pursue for the next few years and beyond. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Brian Ossenbeck : Appreciate taking the question. So, Alan, maybe one for you on coal, I was little surprised to see that RPU was up sequentially ex-fuel, so maybe if you can give some color behind that and where do you think this goes in 4Q, '19 and 2020. And obviously the export markets are telling us, things are going to get worse before they get better again. So I just wanted to see if there's any other offsets that you might have from a pricing or yield perspective, considering it was a bit stronger this quarter than we expected. Alan Shaw : Yes, absolutely, Brian. As I've noted in my prepared remarks, we continue to deliver strong pricing across all of our business units. Coal is no exception. Coal will be pressured in the fourth quarter with the reduction and the seaborne coking coal price. So, you should see a sequential decline in export coal pricing as we move into the fourth quarter and that's going to be running up against some difficult comps, because at the same this time last year we were seeing a sequential improvement in export coal pricing. So that will be a headwind for us. Throughout all of this, we are continuing to focus on pricing to the value of our product and we are delivering a very good product to our customers. Brian Ossenbeck : And then one on fuel and train weights for you, Mike. We've seen some pretty good progress on fuel in particular from the rest of the class ones we're looking at Norfolk. It looks like fuel efficiency, gallons-per-thousand GTMs are actually getting a bit worse sequentially and year-over-year. So, clearly we're seeing train weighs aren't moving up as fast as you think throughout the course of the plan, but what can you offer on, I know you\u2019ve got some initiatives there, but it seems to be a pretty big factor for efficiency gains that others have realized, but you haven't been able to take that sort of stride. Mike Wheeler : Yes, so on the fuel efficiency side, we are seeing an increase in general merchandise train weights. So that was part of the TOP21 plan. We're getting those benefits, but they are offset by the headwinds of the lower train weights on the intermodal and bulk trains and we're making - we're taking actions to address that. You'll see more of that in Phase II as we go forward and then some of that in Phase III as well. But we also have a very aggressive initiative on utilizing the energy management technology that we've been rolling out. And so, this is an all-hands-on-deck thing and we've got folks down in our new consolidated network operation center really staying on top of this, making sure we got the right locomotive on the head-end that's got working energy management and then making sure that we're using the right horsepower-per-tonnage for our trains, being very aggressive with that, and then making sure that, that we're compliant with the energy management technology. So, big initiative and we expect that to be paying off as we go forward. Jim Squires : Brian, I'd like to weigh in on this as well. We benchmark our peers' performance all the time and do so extensively, and we are aware of the ground that we have to make up in fuel efficiency. We have - because we have not made progress despite our best efforts in the last couple of quarters [indiscernible]. That's going to change. We are focused on all the things that Mike has outlined. Running longer, heavier trains is certainly a part of it. On-board energy management, real-time fuel monitoring, horsepower-per-trailing-ton compliance and so forth. A host of initiatives in place, which we believe will bear fruit as I am holding our operations team shortly accountable to that goal. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott Group : So I want to go back to Justin's first question because I'm not sure if I understood the answer. So, you guys said there's $32 million of legal costs in the third and you talked about $25 million of bridge costs in the fourth. So, that's 50 basis points to OR. If we were to exclude those, would you have been hitting the OR targets or not? I guess we're all trying to understand, is this a small margin missed that's arguably understandable or is this a bigger margin miss? Jim Squires : Cindy, why don't you give that. Cindy Earhart : So, Scott. As Jim said previously, the $32 million and the additional cost of $25 million were not only bridge costs, but also lading costs associated with derailment. Well, our guidance to a miss on the 100 basis point OR improvement, we don't exclude either one of those and we're going to continue to push as hard as we can to improve the OR. But those have not been excluded in that guidance today. Scott Group : No, no. I understand they're not excluded; I'm just saying as we play with our models, if we were to exclude them, would you be hitting that OR target or not. I think that's what we're all trying to understand. Cindy Earhart : I think that I would say that we will miss our target. The extent of it is probably not material. It's not a big miss, but it will be a miss. Jim Squires : Again, that does not diminish our confidence in any way that we will get to a 60% operating ratio by 2021. Scott Group : And then, Jim. So I think - I mean, all the rails are dealing with the same volume issues. I look so far - I think every rail has had better margin improvement than you so far in the third quarter, even though you're at a lower starting point. So, do you feel like you're going fast enough? Do you feel like you've got the right people to get us here? And then another difference is sort of on the capital front. Is there - With volumes weaker, are there opportunities to sort of change the capital spend? Jim Squires : We are controlling the things that we can control and doing so aggressively. So we've been through all of the expense savings initiatives, which bore fruit in the third quarter and for the year-to-date, and we will continue to push on all of those things as far as we must to get to that 60% operating ratio by 2021. We've got a great team in place and everybody is aligned around our bottom line shareholder value goals. Let's see. The second part of your question, Scott, was the capital. Yeah. So we have previously talked about a range of 16% to 18% of revenue for capital spending. What really matters here, obviously, is shareholder returns and return on capital. That's what we're managing to, that's why we are targeting that level of capital spend because we believe that it is the optimal range of capital spending relative to revenue, to generate the return on capital and the shareholder returns we're seeking to generate. It's a range and in the mean times we may take it down somewhat within that range. But again, it really gets back to return on capital and our goal of generating superior shareholder value. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jordan Alger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Jordan Alger : So I know you've reiterated the 60 operating ratio in 2021. I'm just sort of curious if volumes stay kind of soft for at least the first part of next year. I mean can you give some sort of sense for how much you think OR and PSR benefits can push things in 2020 even with let's say, first half continuing softness environment? Thanks. Jim Squires : We've spent a good deal of time already this morning talking about the efficiency initiatives, those that are well underway in Phase II of TOP21. Those will come to fruition in 2020 so we will see the full year benefit of expense savings from all of those initiatives, which we're pushing so hard on in 2019. And then we get into Phase III of TOP21, which will result in additional cost structural savings in 2021. And those will be again the drivers of further expense savings on the royalty 60 operating ratio. Jordan Alger : And then just a quick follow-up on intermodal, comps obviously get pretty easy by middle of next year. If we get some truck capacity tightening and maybe spot pricing turns the other way a little bit. Would you expect or can you potentially anticipate some sort of inflection, especially given where your network is on rail intermodal volumes. I mean is that something that's conceivable as we move through next year, again assuming the economy is reasonably okay? Jim Squires : Alan? Alan Shaw : Yes, so Jordan we are aligned with the best channel partners in the business. And we are aligned with the steamship lines that are adding capacity to the East Coast as you see a shift from the West Coast to the East Coast. So we've got some strategic advantages to our intermodal franchise, which make it the best in the East. And so absolutely - as the economy turns and we deliver a very strong service product to our customers. We anticipate that intermodal is going to remain a growth engine for Norfolk Southern. Intermodal revenues, as you know grew by 11% in 2017 and then follow that with an 18% growth last year. We've got a great franchise, great customers it\u2019s going to continue to pay dividends for our shareholders. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Ravi Shanker : Can you just clarify your current go-to-market strategy on price are you at a point where you guys can command the price you need to make the yield-up targets without losing volume. Or do you think that's more of a 2020 or 2021 thing, when there are more changes made in the network? Jim Squires : Alan? Alan Shaw : Ravi, we are very confident in our ability to price through a - vastly improved service product and we're providing our customers with a platform for growth. Take a look at our merchandise network in which the year-over-year rate of increase in price has improved for nine consecutive quarters. And you also see it reflected in RPU trends and revenue per ton mile trend. So we are intently focused on price even in this weak economic backdrop because we've got a great franchise and a great service product. Ravi Shanker : And as follow-up you guys recently appointed Mr. Claude Mongeau to your Board at this point in your PSR strategy kind of what do you looking for from him and kind of what role is he likely to play? Jim Squires : As I mentioned earlier Claude is an outstanding addition to our Board with his extensive experience in the industry. He got operations knowledge and experience, same on the finance side. So he will be a welcome addition, he is a welcome addition to our Board. And we'll bring all of that and more as we proceed through our PSR journey for the next couple of years and beyond. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Fadi Chamoun with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Fadi Chamoun : Maybe, Alan if the pricing in the intermodal business doesn't really improve like truck pricing competition remains intense. Can intermodal margin improve to the level needed to achieve a 60% OR over the next couple of years and - if you're looking on the operating side. Are there steps meaningful steps that can be taken in the intermodal network to improve the OR if you can maybe outline those? Jim Squires : Alan? Alan Shaw : You take a look at the cyclical nature of the trucking industry we saw weakness in the spot truck market in 2011 and 2015 and 2019. And through all of that, we continue to deliver year-over-year rate increases in intermodal every single quarter. So we are very confident in the strength, the unique strength of our intermodal franchise. Our alignment with the best channel partners in the business and we're going to cycle through this as - we noted before we grow revenue by 11% in 2017 and 18% and 2018. We've got a very strong franchise. The spot market will recover, and we're going to be positioned for growth because of the very strong service product that we're delivering. Fadi Chamoun : And maybe just follow-up on the operational side, you mentioned clean sheeting in intermodal what is that exactly in tailwind. And if you can describe to us what is going on the operating side that would - going to improve the margin performance of that business? Jim Squires : Mike, why don\u2019t you take that one? Mike Wheeler : So, on the intermodal terminals just like we did the clean sheeting of our merchandise terminals. We're looking at each terminal and making sure that we have the best practices across all the terminals in our intermodal network. We've got all the right processes and procedures. And then once we do that we\u2019ll sink that up with the train plan for more efficiencies going forward and then continue to deliver good service product at the same time. So it's kind of that deep dive into each one of the - each one of the intermodal terminals using good industrial engineering practices to make them as efficient as possible and more importantly consistent best practices across all the intermodal terminals. Jim Squires : Mike, I'm very encouraged by this process because we and our customer saw the benefits in the merchandise network as we clean sheeted the merchandise network. You saw it reflected in a reduction and dwell, you saw it reflected in an increase in train speed and you saw it reflected in an improvement and our SDI our customer facing service metrics. And so I'm confident that we're going to continue to deliver the same as we apply these same principles to our intermodal franchise. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question. Jason Seidl : I wanted to talk a little bit about your T&E productivity. You've shown a slight improvement in 2019 and you put a check there saying you're sort of on track but if we look out to your 2021 goal that's a much larger step-up. Could you walk us through how you guys plan on getting there? Jim Squires : Mike? Mike Wheeler : Yes it's going to be the continuation of the things that we've done where we continue to look at increasing the size of the trains and that drives crew starts down. Continuing the distributed power strategy, we're going to do more and more of that and that will drive train consolidations. And then continue to look at our local and yard network and making sure we're as efficient as possible there. So as we go through all this we uncover more opportunities. And when we uncover those more opportunities we get into that we take the benefits of it and then we go the next step. So this has been a very good process for us to continue down that path. And we will continue to do that, we've got more in the gas tank with all these phases that we're talking about. So yeah, we're going to get there Q \u2013 Jason Seidl : And I want to jump a little bit back on Scotts CapEx question going forward. Jim, I think you mentioned a range of 16% to 18%. Given what we've seen in the overall demand environment and the competitive truck market, should we look at 2020 as probably being towards the lower end of that range? Jim Squires : Jason, we'll give you some more guidance on CapEx, expected CapEx, when we meet again in January. But let me say this, majority of our capital budget, as you well know, the great majority is replenishment capital spending, including our DC to AC conversion program, which is meant to and will rejuvenate our locomotive fleet. So for us, that's a pretty significant line item in and of itself in the capital budget under the category of sustaining capital spending. And then of course there's everything else that goes into sustaining franchise rail cost balance and so on and so forth. The growth piece of it, we will protect, we will project. It's relatively small compared to the sustaining CapEx. But it needs to be part of the plan, because we do aspire to grow and we believe we have growth prospects that will generate excellent shareholder returns down the road. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Q \u2013 Chris Wetherbee : Wanted to ask about head count. Obviously, you've made some progress here and target further progress in the fourth quarter. I wanted to get a sense of maybe how you feel like the workforce is calibrated to the volume environment? Assuming some degree of stabilization, how much more is there to go as you kind of run through Phase 2 and Phase 3 of Top 21? How should we be thinking about sort of headcount as we move through the beginning to first half of 2020? Jim Squires : Cindy, why don't you go back over to what we are expecting in the fourth quarter, reflecting end of year versus our average headcount in the fourth quarter versus fourth quarter of last year and then talk a little bit about where we're going? Cindy Earhart : Yes. Well, Chris, as I said, we expect the year-end headcount to be at 20 - around 23,300; which is 3,200 less than the end of last year of 2018. So we've made obviously significant progress. I think our original estimates for headcount reductions this year were 500. So that has really been accelerating. And obviously, big part of that structural, there has been - there's been reductions associated with volume and then you could moderate that as volume goes up or down, but we certainly expect going into next year, you've heard all the initiatives that Mike has talked about, both in terms of T&E as well as mechanical that we expect headcount to continue to come down. Jim Squires : We also want to be sure we are prepared for when - so that's a balancing act, and we want to be sure that we operate as optimally as we can in a declining volume environment, like we're in now, but we also want to be confident that we can handle the business when it comes back. We believe that we have a great formula for that, we're just that. And that is responding appropriately in the current volume environment, but we are also protecting our ability to handle the business when it returns down the road. Q \u2013 Chris Wetherbee : And then if I could turn to Purchase Services, it was up sequentially, although volumes were down. I wanted to get a sense, it's a big, obviously, line item on the cost side for you guys. When we think about sort of plan, as it continues to roll out over the next few phases, how big an opportunity is that? Was there anything specific in the third quarter and just kind of how can you go from here? Jim Squires : Cindy? Cindy Earhart : Well, Chris, as we talked before about Purchase Services. And I will say, if you look at Purchase Services and rents, we have seen big improvements, as I mentioned before on equipment rent side, a $35 million improvement year-over-year. And that's really been associated with just the improved velocity of the network, as well as getting a lot of these cars offline. So that has been favorable. We expect that to continue to be favorable going forward. On Purchase Services and rents, there's a lot of different things that are in that category. Some is volume dependent, although not as much as you would think. We have pointed out in the prior quarters that we've had additional spending on the IT side. We're going to continue to invest in IT and we've seen that on capital spending, as well as in this particular item. We think that that's really prudent investment to be making, because it's focused on things that are going to improve the productivity of the workforce, the reliability of our equipment and so forth. We did have - we've had a little bit additional expenditure in Purchase Services and rents associated with freight cars, as we've taken freight cars offline and we've had to turn them back leases, we've had some additional repair costs associated with that. So there's some puts and takes there. But overall, I think you'll see Purchase Services continue similarly as we move forward sequentially. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Amit Mehrotra : Just a quick one. The first one at least will be quick. Was there any impact in the quarter from the strike at General Motors? I know auto volumes were actually up in the quarter and yield was kind of flat. I didn't know if there was anything to call out there with respect to stranded or unabsorbed costs related to that or even in the fourth quarter? Jim Squires : Alan, why don't you take that. Alan Shaw : Yes, the timing of that work stoppage will more impact our volumes in the fourth quarter. Amit Mehrotra : Any stranded costs associated with that, that we should think about for the fourth quarter or not enough to call out? Alan Shaw : No. Amit Mehrotra : And then, Jim, I wanted to just, if I could just follow-up, I think on the - one of the very first questions. And I think it's really the most important one with respect to your OR targets for 2021 at least. And obviously it's in the context, if you guys walking back this year's OR improvement. So when we look back in February or February 11th, when you did the Investor Day in Atlanta, you guys were very explicit about your revenue targets; 5% compounded annual growth rate for the entire business, 10% revenue growth in intermodal. I was hoping that you could be as specific now, 10-months later or so or a little bit less than that. Given what's happened in the revenue framework, how the revenue side of the business rolls up to your OR target. And I understand you're not going to use revenue as excuse and there's a lot of productivity, but given how specific you were in February, we'd appreciate it I think if you can give us some sense of what that revenue roll up looks like now, relative to the 5% and 10% growth you did in February to get to that 60, 60 by 2021 target? Jim Squires : Fair enough. Let me say, first of all, about the strategic plan. As with any such plan, the assumptions they are in, are good for about as long as it takes the inkjet to write on the strategic plan. So conditions change. Business conditions change, the revenue picture, the volume picture has changed rather dramatically since we issued the three-year plan in February. We've always said that one of our hallmarks is flexibility and adjustability. That's what we did in 2016, when we saw a significant volume decline. And we responded with additional productivity initiatives in order to hit our goals. That's what we will do again this time around. Now, we will review with you our revised macro assumptions in January when we report out on the fourth quarter results, and we'll give you our productivity goals, our Tier-1 methods going forward for the next couple of years. We'll give you some high-level assumptions with regard to revenue, and it's part of that plan as well. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Tom Wadewitz : So, Alan, I wanted to get your thoughts on the export coal framework for 2020. Just maybe if you could give us a sense about, at current prices, did you expect tonnage to be down pretty meaningfully? Or if you look at seaborne prices, do you think it's more of a hit to your, the revenue per ton that you're achieving? Just maybe some broader thoughts about that and I don't know if you want to tie it to met coal levels and where you really have the sensitivity to a tonnage decline? Alan Shaw : Tom, as I've talked about, at current prices it makes it really difficult for U.S. coals to compete in the market, both on the - with respect to thermal and metallurgical. We've talked before about some of those thermal contracts are effectively hedged, but contracts between the producers and the receivers are effectively hedged through 2019. And so you'll see pressure in the thermal market as we roll into 2020. And the met market is going to follow demand overseas in the global economy, and seaborne coking coal pricing. And I'll provide a lot more color on that on our fourth quarter earnings call, as we start talking about 2020. Tom Wadewitz : I guess if you look back just to kind of look at levels of export coal on Norfolk, in the 2015-2016 area, you were kind of 15 million tons, 16 million tons. I think 2019, you're running at a rate of like something like 24 million tons. So do you think this feels like 2015, 2016 or would you say; hey, we haven't fallen to that level, it of feels better than that. So just trying to get a sense of the right framework to consider given that there's obviously pressure on the export market. Alan Shaw : There is pressure and we've been pretty clear about that. Let's just talk about coal broadly. Right now coal is about 12% of our volume. And export coal is about 25% of our coal volumes. So there you're talking about a little bit less than 3% of our overall volume. It's important to us, it's important to our franchise. We've got a very diverse franchise, as we've built out our intermodal network. So it's - I'll provide more color and more historical context on the outlook for export coal in the fourth quarter call. The important thing to consider is that we've got a great merchandise network, a great intermodal franchise and we are securing price, reflecting the value of our product. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna Financial Group. Please proceed with your question. Bascome Majors : On the receivables write-off you took for the September jury ruling on the [indiscernible] contract. Is there any accruing revenue for liquidated damages in this year, and is there any go forward impact associated with that ruling? Jim Squires : Cindy? Cindy Earhart : Bascome, we've recognized what we think is the probable financial impact of that legal dispute. Bascome Majors : Was that all backward looking or is there some ongoing impact included in that charge? Cindy Earhart : No, that was backwards. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Ken Hoexter : And I know OR has been hit a lot, but in an environment where you're supposed to be significantly cutting costs and walking away from the 100-basis point improvement, and your peer is doing 400 basis points better excluding the real estate sales, and you've got employees down 9%, cars and trains are down. Jim, maybe talk about why is this not getting better or Michael, why are we not seeing a stair-step improvement at this point? Given the changes you've made, is it just the coal margins are impacting so much overwhelming the gains or is there something else that's constraining the ability to get that stair-step improvement? Jim Squires : Ken, certainly, we're dealing with a different sort of revenue and volume context and reward in the first half. So that's been a major change. We have responded aggressively to that change with the resource reductions we've been through this morning, positions locomotives, freight cars, materials, all favorable in expenses. So you're seeing the momentum in expense reductions from our acceleration of the various initiatives with more to come. Now, we still don't expect to see operating ratio improvement for the full year. But because of the additional expenses that we've been through this morning in the fourth quarter, we don't expect to meet the - at least a 100-basis points goal. But that does not diminish our confidence. We can get to a 60-operating ratio by 2021. Ken Hoexter : And then I guess maybe, Alan, given that volumes have gotten worse now year sequentially and seemingly at an accelerating pace, I don't know if that was - is related to the derailment Cindy talked about, but you're now down 8% quarter-to-date. And I know it's only a couple of weeks in the 4th quarter, but down from 5% to 6%. Coal seems to be staying down mid-teens, but, Alan, you mentioned things are still ugly. But are things getting worse than an accelerating pace, just looking at intermodal and ag and some of the other commodities outside of kind of autos from the strike? It just seems like we're accelerating on the downside, maybe your view on economic side. Alan Shaw : Again, we're not really seeing this much of a peak within the intermodal franchise. And so that is certainly having an impact on volumes and year-over-year comps. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the floor back to Mr. Squires, for any closing comments. Jim Squires : I want to thank you all for your questions and for participating in today's call, and we look forward to speaking with you again in January. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.  At this time, it is my pleasure to introduce Pete Sharbel, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Sharbel, you may now begin. Peter Sharbel : Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. Please note that during today's call, we may make certain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and may differ materially from actual results. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. Our presentation slides are available at norfolksouthern.com in the Investors Section along with our non-GAAP reconciliation. Additionally, a transcript and downloads will be posted after the call.  It is now my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's Chairman, President and CEO, Jim Squires. James Squires : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Norfolk Southern's Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Alan Shaw, Chief Marketing Officer; Mike Wheeler, Chief Operating Officer; and Mark George, Chief Financial Officer.  2019 was a remarkable year of transformation at Norfolk Southern. We launched our TOP21 operating plan to transform our railroad while fulfilling our commitment to dramatically improve our service product as we become more efficient. We've made tremendous strides on both of those fronts and delivered progress on our strategic plan. In the face of a challenging volume environment, we're pleased to share our results today that demonstrate this organization's strong momentum in streamlining our operations and making substantial progress toward our long-term commitments, thanks to the hard work and significant efforts by our workforce and leaders.  Slide 4 highlights those results. For the quarter, EPS was $2.55, and the operating ratio was 64.2%. For the full year, income from operations reached record levels at nearly $4 billion, resulting in a record operating ratio of 64.7%, a 70 basis point improvement over 2018. Earnings per share increased 8% to $10.25. We've now achieved record operating ratio results for 4 consecutive years. This year's improvement is particularly impressive against the backdrop of contracting volumes. These records demonstrate our commitment to continuous improvement. And underscore our steadfast dedication to creating shareholder value. Despite volumes deteriorating throughout the year, culminating in fourth quarter and full year volume declines of 9% and 5%, respectively, we remained focused on running our railroad as efficiently as possible and with a high level of customer service, achieving our locomotive and T&E workforce productivity goals despite having less freight to haul. These efforts contributed to the record full year results I mentioned a moment ago, and the core margin improvement accomplished during the fourth quarter, which Mark will discuss shortly, demonstrates the significant momentum we're carrying into 2020 and beyond.  As we enter 2020, we continue to build on the strategic plan initiatives we launched in 2019. While rolling out Phase 3 of our PSR-based operating plan, TOP21, which will drive additional productivity across our resource base, all while maintaining the high-quality service product established in 2019. The team will provide additional details regarding these initiatives as well as further details on our fourth quarter and full year results. Alan will cover trends in revenue. Mike will cover operational performance, and Mark will go over the financial results.  I'll now turn the call over to Alan. Alan Shaw : Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Macroeconomic headwinds challenged volume in 2019, particularly in the second half of the year. With these tough conditions, we continued our focus on margin improvement, supported by the value that our outstanding service product creates in the market.  On Slide 6, excess truck capacity, trade and economic uncertainty and manufacturing weakness negatively affected our markets, driving a 9% decline in volume. We partially mitigated the impact of declining volumes with stronger revenue per unit excluding fuel in all 3 of our business units, including quarterly records in our Merchandise and intermodal business groups. Norfolk Southern's revenue per unit has increased year-over-year for the last 12 quarters despite the market cycles over that period of time. The weak manufacturing environment and low commodity prices drove down Merchandise volumes in all groups, except chemicals, led by a 17% decline in steel. Import steel tariffs affected the traffic flows and lower steel prices reflected weak demand. Merchandise volume declines were partially offset by an increase in crude oil, which more than doubled its volume year-over-year.  Intermodal revenue declined 8% due to excess truck capacity in a weak freight environment. International comparisons were difficult as the inventory pull forward drove a spike in fourth quarter 2018 volume. Coal volume and revenue were down 21% year-over-year, with the largest volume decline in utility coal. Our Northern utility portfolio was impacted by low gas prices and combined cycle capacity. Export was influenced by falling seaborne met prices and Chinese tariffs, while export thermal prices remained at low levels, making it difficult for U.S. coals to compete globally.  Turning to Slide 7. In 2019, revenues decreased 1%, despite a 5% decline in total volume, evident from our margin improvement strategy, revenue declines were partially offset by a 3% increase in revenue per unit. Merchandise revenue reached a record $6.8 billion in 2019, while volume declined 3%. Volume headwinds occurred from weakness in the manufacturing economy, the lose truck market and declines in steel and natural gas liquids. We were favored by fuel price differentials that boosted crude oil demand to East Coast refineries, and we secured increased aggregate volume.  Intermodal revenue decreased 2% on a 4% volume decline as gains in international were offset by domestic declines. Lower spot truck prices and excess capacity in the trucking industry, reduced domestic intermodal demand in this weak-freight environment.  Turning to coal. Revenue declined 8%. Utility volume declines were predominantly in the north, where low natural gas prices suppressed coal burn, while southern utilities benefited from inventory build in the first half of the year. Depressed seaborne coking coal and thermal prices led to lower export volumes and prices that were further impacted by production issues. While uncertain economic conditions negatively impacted revenue and volume in 2019, we maintained our focus on improving our service and creating a product that will enable our customers and Norfolk Southern to grow when the freight environment improves. This approach supports our strategy of margin improvement, which is reflected in our increasing revenue per unit, providing opportunities for operating leverage when demand improves.  Moving to our outlook on Slide 8. We are closely monitoring developments in the macro economy and its impact on the industries and business segments in which we compete as well as our customers' expectations as we execute our strategy. GDP growth is expected to be in the 2% range in 2020 with the majority of that growth from personal consumption, creating opportunities in our consumer-driven intermodal and Merchandise markets. Continued weakness in manufacturing, low commodity prices will impact our coal franchise in other segments of our merchandise markets. Overall, we have not seen an inflection point in volume trends and a high degree of uncertainty exists. We see growth potential as we move into the second half of 2020 due to forecasted improvement in the trucking and industrial sectors and easier comparisons. U.S. light vehicle production is forecast to improve more than 5% in 2020. Improved price differentials are predicted to sustain fourth quarter 2019 crude volume levels through 2020. Overall, we expect total Merchandise revenue improvement enabled by our strategy with continued support from our consistent, reliable and quality service product.  The truck market remains lose with spot rates leveling off, yet our customers and data providers forecast some tightening later in the year. Based on this information and new business initiatives, our intermodal revenue and volume are expected to grow in 2020. In coal, additional gas and renewable generation capacity continues to erode coal share of electricity generation. Coking and seaborne thermal coal indices are substantially below prior levels, impacting both export volume and pricing.  In summary, as headwinds persist in the freight environment, we expect 2020 revenue to be flat with the first quarter similar to the fourth quarter of last year, and conditions improving as the year progresses. We remain focused on a disciplined pursuit of efficiency while recognizing the value our consistent, fast and reliable service product creates for our customers. In light of continued economic uncertainty and with our demonstrated willingness and ability to adjust to market conditions, this approach provides the platform from which we will further enhance value for both our customers and shareholders.  I will now turn it over to Mike for an update on operations. Michael Wheeler : Thank you, Alan. Today, I will update you on the state of our operations. In the fourth quarter, we continued to deliver strong service for our customers and significant cost savings, which drove a record operating ratio for the year. This operational leverage is driven by our relentless execution of the core PSR principles and our TOP21 operating plan.  Moving to Slide 10. Our network is running fast and on time. Record train performance and record terminal dwell drove near record car level velocity and strong asset utilization for Norfolk Southern and our customers. These achievements support our strategy to meet our customers' expectations while eliminating costs and prudently managing our assets. Our momentum has continued into 2020 and will be a tailwind to our initiatives this year.  As seen on Slide 11, our operational performance is driving strong service levels as evidenced by our customer-facing metrics. Intermodal availability, which measures our customer commitment to grounding of the box, shipment consistency, which measures trip plan adherence for merchandise traffic and local operating plan adherence, which measures execution of the critical First Mile and Last Mile of service. All of these metrics were at or near record levels. We have been sharing our metrics with our customers for well over a decade, and we use them to have data-driven discussions to confirm the value of our service product. We remain committed to providing a high level of service for our customers while achieving our productivity goals.  Turning to our service and productivity metrics on Slide 12. These metrics align with our strategic plan as they measure key productivity and customer service levels. We have been aggressively reducing our resources to meet our productivity goals despite the drop in our GTMs. Starting with the service delivery index, which is the on-time delivery performance of our scheduled shipments indexed to 2018. This is a customer-facing metric that combines shipment consistency and intermodal availability, which were detailed on the previous slide. We exceeded our 2019 goal and actually achieved our 2021 goal 2 years earlier. We will maintain this high level of service by continuing to execute our TOP21 plan. We exceeded our 2019 T&E productivity goal despite a significant drop in GTMs. We are at our lowest T&E headcount on record while still providing exceptional service.  We are realizing the benefit of our TOP21 plan, which has the added benefit of capacity in the train plan to allow for growth on the existing trains. While we missed our 2019 train weight goal for the full year, we actually met the goal in the second half of the year with the implementation of our TOP21 plan. We have, however, taken another look that our 2021 train weight goal in light of the continued change in the coal market. We believe the new goal of 6,700 tons, which is 5% higher than our baseline, reflects the improved productivity of our TOP21 operating plan, while taking into account the projected mix. We also met our goal for locomotive productivity for the year by aggressively rationalizing our locomotive fleet, which is 20% lower than 2018. As mentioned in our previous call, this has allowed us to significantly rationalize the resources associated with the maintenance of these locomotives, including a reduction of 600 positions last year and an additional 135 positions this year.  Regarding fuel, we will benefit from our lower locomotive fleet size, our aggressive implementation of energy management technology and our DC to AC conversions. And the cars online continues to be a positive story for Norfolk Southern. As we noted throughout the year, we exceeded our original 2021 goal, thanks to our fast and consistent service product. To that end, we have established a new goal of 129,000 cars going forward, which includes cars in storage that can be deployed as market conditions warrant.  In summary, we are confident we will meet our productivity goals for this year as we will now have the momentum of full year benefits of our previous rightsizing of our workforce and locomotive fleet. This will get us more than halfway to our 2021 productivity goals this year. As you can see on Slide 13, we accelerated our progress in reducing crew starts during the fourth quarter. We continued to build on the success of TOP21 with phase 2 of the plan, which included an initial consolidation of some bulk movements into the manifest network and dividends from our yearlong Clean Sheeting program. This improved fluidity is allowing for the continued reduction in yard and local assignments. This quarterly year-over-year improvement accelerated in the fourth quarter, with the majority of these improvements being long-term structural gains. As previously mentioned on the other slide, we have capacity in the new plan to accept additional volumes without a commensurate rise in crew starts. We anticipate continued strong year-over-year comparisons as we begin to roll out phase 3 of TOP21, completing delivery of the promised 3 phases of the program in 1.5 years instead of the anticipated 3 years. Going forward our network planning and operations group will be evaluating the plan and the network for further optimizations.  In closing, this has been a critical year for Norfolk Southern. We started the year by detailing our implementation of the core PSR principles. We have successfully executed on these principles despite a challenging market. Our service is at record levels. We achieved a record operating ratio and our serious injury ratio was the lowest in the last 5 years. We are carrying this momentum into 2020.  I will now turn it over to Mark, who will cover the financials. Mark George : Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Before we get into the detailed P&L, I want to point to a chart in the appendix that specifies for you some large and unusual items that impact the results and comparisons versus 2018. I'd like to talk to those impacts upfront on Slide 15 for the sake of clarity.  This chart illustrates the effect of those items on the OR and EPS for the quarter as well as for the year. The reported changes to OR and EPS are reflected on the bottom row, and we distill those drivers in the white rose above. The first item, as you may recall, relates to a property sale in the Atlanta area in the fourth quarter of 2018. That particular gain was $112 million and creates an OR headwind of 380 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2019 and 100 basis points for the full year, with a headwind to EPS of about $0.30.  Next was the $32 million receivable write-off arising from a legal dispute that we called out in the third quarter. This reduced the 2019 OR by 30 basis points and EPS by $0.09. The final headwind involves the nonoperating impairment that we booked in the second quarter related to the natural resource assets we have been actively marketing. In the fourth quarter, we took an additional $21 million impairment related to those same assets, and that had a $0.06 impact to EPS in the quarter. And when added to the 2 -- the second quarter impairment loss, the EPS impact for the full year was $0.14. You'll note we had a low effective tax rate in the quarter. This was driven by certain income tax credits authorized by Congress in December of 2019, which were retroactive to 2018. The impact to the fourth quarter EPS was $0.07, and for the full year, it was $0.04. Beyond these unusual items, the core improvement in the OR was 240 basis points for the quarter and 200 basis points for the full year, while core improvement to EPS was $0.28 for the quarter and $1.23 for the year. Now moving to the fourth quarter, Slide 16. Revenue was down 7% in the quarter, driven by a 9% volume contraction, partially offset by RPU improvement. Operating expenses, as reported, were 5% lower, including 5 points of headwind from the absence of the prior year land sale.  Drilling into the expense categories on Slide 17. As Mike illustrated earlier, our TOP21 PSR-based operating plan has reduced the amount of resources we need to run the network, resulting in fewer trains and lower crew starts manifesting in substantial cost savings across multiple expense categories. Starting with compensation and benefits. We drove a $127 million reduction in expenses in the fourth quarter. That's a decline of 17% on a 16% reduction in employees. Our employment levels declined throughout the quarter, and this, along with lower overtime, health and welfare benefits as well as less recrews, saved us $86 million. This favorability was partially offset by $17 million of additional expense due to inflation in pay rates. In the quarter, incentive compensation expense was lower by $57 million, due largely to last year's higher payout that disproportionately impacted the fourth quarter of 2018. So we drove average headcount down by approximately 1,500 employees from last quarter and have reduced by 4,200 compared to the last year. Run rate benefits from this will continue into 2020 on top of additional efficiency actions.  Moving to fuel. Reduced consumption and lower prices drove a $52 million decline in fuel expense. We improved on our fuel efficiency as fuel consumption declined by 11% on the 9% decrease in volumes, despite adverse mix from weaker coal where our fuel efficiency is strongest. Here in 2020, fuel efficiency is getting intense attention through various initiatives, including continued locomotive upgrades and deeper energy management penetration as Mike mentioned. Moving over to purchase services, rents and materials. Our initiatives to improve asset utilization are also driving a reduction in expenses. The increased network velocity, improved fluidity, and fewer locomotives and freight cars on the network drove $15 million in savings associated with equipment rents and $12 million in savings of material cost. These expenses -- sorry, these savings were partially offset by increased detouring costs due to a bridge washout and derailment expenses that amounted to $13 million collectively. The fast response and strong execution by our operations team limited the financial impact of the derailment to only half of the $25 million we signaled at the last earnings call. So when looking at the big picture, the underlying change to our cost structure accelerated in the fourth quarter as we continue to drive resource reductions through the end of the year. The full year effect of those savings will be realized in 2020.  Moving to Slide 18. Let's take a look at our summarized fourth quarter financial results. Other income included $31 million of favorability from investment returns on our corporate-owned life insurance, where we had positive returns in Q4 2019 versus losses in Q4 of 2018. We also had $50 million of higher gains on the sale of nonoperating properties than prior year. These amounts were partially offset by the additional $21 million asset impairment loss that I mentioned earlier. The lower effective tax rate, 19.6%, was driven by both the retroactive tax credits as well as higher nontaxable returns on the corporate-owned life insurance. Income taxes will represent some headwind in 2020 as we expect the tax rate to be between 23% and 24%.  Shifting to the full year on Slide 19. We delivered impressive results for the year in the face of accelerating declines in revenue and the net headwind items we discussed on Slide 15. We reduced railway operating expenses by $192 million. We set company records for operating income and operating ratio. Our railway operating ratio improved 70 basis points over 2018. Net income improved by 2%, but diluted earnings per share grew 8% to $10.25 for the full year aided by a 5% reduction in our average share count. Achieving the cost reductions while pushing delivery performance for our customers to record levels, demonstrates our commitment to long-term value creation.  Recapping on Slide 20, our full year cash flows from operating activities was $3.9 billion, and free cash flow for the year was a record at nearly $1.9 billion. Dividends and share repurchases for the year totaled over $3 billion. So to close, we clearly have created momentum on the cost side, despite the volume challenges and obstacles that were unforeseen at the beginning of the year. It's that momentum, plus new initiatives, which provides us with strong leverage going into 2020 to continue to drive profit growth and margin expansion.  Thank you, and I'll turn the call back over to Jim. James Squires : Thank you, Mark. As you've heard on the call today, the Norfolk Southern team made tremendous strides in executing the strategic plan we laid out a year ago. Amid a rapidly changing macroeconomic landscape, we pivoted our productivity initiatives and achieved a locomotive fleet reduction of 20% and a workforce reduction of 8% for the full year average, with those figures accelerating to 22% and 16%, respectively, in the fourth quarter. These resource adjustments significantly outpaced the volume declines, demonstrating strong cost momentum while maintaining exceptionally strong customer service levels.  Turning to Slide 22. I'll wrap up with our 2020 expectations. First and foremost, we will continue to execute our strategic plan with the top priority of running the most efficient railroad possible while being a best-in-class supply chain partner for our customers. As you heard, we are modeling net overall revenue to be flat for the year, with persistent headwinds in coal to be offset by improving comparisons in Merchandise and intermodal as the year progresses. Despite -- and within that environment, we have confidence that our productivity and efficiency formula will result in significant operating ratio improvement this year that will get us more than halfway to our committed 60% OR in 2021.  Lastly, as we continue to execute our highly effective locomotive fleet modernization program, we're targeting a capital expenditures program between 16% and 18% of revenues. We remain committed to returning capital to shareholders through a 1/3 dividend payout ratio, with remaining cash and borrowing capacity used for share repurchases. This disciplined capital allocation strategy represents our commitment to enhanced shareholder value through returning capital and ensuring Norfolk Southern is positioned for continued success. Before we turn it over to questions, I want to thank each and every NS employee for their hard work and commitment to the strategic transformation of our railroad.  Thank you for your attention. We'll now open the line for Q&A. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Bascome Majors : Mark, you've been in the CFO seat for about three months now and have had some time to get the lay of the land. Could you just take a step back and kind of give us versus your expectations coming in? Kind of what's as expected, maybe what has surprised you? And are there any changes that we should expect to see as investors with you leading the finance organization versus how assets handled things historically? Mark George : Thanks for the question. Yes, coming in from the outside, a different industry, a culture that clearly is different than the one I've come from, I would say that I'm surprised that we see a great blend here of long-tenured industry experts, who are very passionate about not just the business, but the industry itself, and the infusion of new talent that come from different walks of life and different industry experiences and that they're actually being welcomed with their new ideas, including my own, frankly, coming from the outside. So that's been kind of a pleasant surprise, I would say. I was not expecting such a welcoming with regard to the new ideas and new concepts being brought in. I'm also kind of impressed by the speed and agility of an old company, so to speak, to react to a very rapidly changing economic environment. You see the charts that Mike showed on how quickly we've taken resources out to respond to volume declines. And then nimbleness, I would say, has surprised me. And coming in, another big observation is just how capital-intensive this business is compared to where I've come from.  We, obviously, spend a couple billion dollars a year in CapEx. We've got over $30 billion of fixed assets. And so it's certainly an area that I need to drill into a little bit more on understanding why we spend so much, certainly, half of that is related to maintaining this big infrastructure to serve your customers and to do it safely. But I do want to understand the rationale for the spends that we have. The justification financially for them and the prioritization process. So it's something that I expect to dig into a little bit. And maybe you've seen a little bit on this call, too. We just want to be transparent with the investment community about the path that we're on of which is to get to a 60% OR by 2021. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Scott Group : So Mark, I'm hoping you can help us with a little bit more clarity on some of the numbers here. So can you give us the -- what the real estate gains above the line were in the fourth quarter? And any expectations for this year in terms of what's assumed in the guidance? And then similarly, with incentive comp, I know it was down in '19 versus '18. Any way to think about is 2020 a year of the headwind tailwind or normal? Any help there. Mark George : Sorry. The second question, Scott. Scott Group : Was just on incentive comp, should we think about that as a headwind in '20? Or is it '20 versus '19, sort of just a normal year on incentive comp? Mark George : No. We would hope that incentive comp is a headwind because we're hoping to have a better year in 2020 than we did, obviously, this year, where we fell a little bit short. So clearly, that will be a little bit of headwind for us. With regard to the real estate, excluding the big one that we carved out for you, gains in the year were a little bit higher than they were last year, less than $20 million. In the fourth quarter, roughly half of that benefit we saw in the fourth quarter of this year. So we had about $10 million of additional gains in '19 versus the fourth quarter of '18, excluding the big one that we carved out. And the guidance, Scott, on real estate. In any given year, we're expecting $40 million to $60 million of gains. It's going to be lumpy, be backloaded. It could happen middle of the year, with real estate, you never are quite sure when you can get things to close and get over the finish line. But we ended this year excluding -- sorry, we ended last year excluding the big gain in that range. And the same thing this year, we ended within that range. Scott Group : Okay. That's helpful. And then -- so on the revenue guidance of flat, maybe if you have a thought on our volumes down and yields up. And then it does feel like you guys are losing some share on the volume side, but clearly doing well on the yield side. Are you okay with that, that yield up strategy and the trade-off of better yields, but weaker volumes than maybe your peer? Or do you feel like you've pushed it too far? Or just some thoughts how you're approaching the market? James Squires : Scott, it's Jim. Let me take the second part of that. The market share question, and then I'll turn it over to Alan to give you some more color on the components of our revenue guidance for this year. We are targeting the truck market. That's the market share opportunity. That's the big opportunity for us. And that is the linchpin of our growth strategy, is getting trucks off the road onto the railroad. So -- and there are opportunities there when it comes to our growth engine, intermodal. And there are also opportunities in the Merchandise round. So -- and we are also certainly committed to achieving value for the services we provide, which value is quite strong these days. We've got a great service product out in the marketplace. And we're very proud of that and think that we can create value for our customers through that service. So Alan, a little bit more color on the 2020 revenue outlook? Alan Shaw : Yes. Scott, coal is going to be a drag throughout the year. And it's going to be a drag both in volume and in price. We've got a great service product out there. And we're taking a long-term view of our markets. We take a long-term view of our approach with our customers as well and so we're very disciplined in securing the value and understanding the value that our service product creates for our customers. As Jim noted, our eyes are on that $800 billion truck market. And that's where the growth opportunities are. And that's where we're going to see improvement as the year progresses. It's -- it requires fierce competition and putting new products out there, new logistics services that our customers value. And we're doing it from a platform in which I'll remind you, we went out in front of our customers, and we told them what we were going to do with our operating changes with PSR. And then we did it.  And there we've created a lot of credibility with our customers for our no surprises approach to our operating plant changes. We implemented it flawlessly. And what's unique about Norfolk Southern is that as we implemented PSR, our service got better. And so we're in a great position to grow as we move forward. And if you think about truck and the opportunities there, it aligns perfectly with the unique strengths of our franchise. We have a powerful intermodal franchise. And we have a very broad and diverse Merchandise franchise as well, and we're focused on opportunities to take business from truck and merchandise as well. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with GR Energy Services. Unidentified Analyst : It's Allison. Just a question, I just want to circle back to the cars online commentary. If I heard you correctly, I think you said that, that number included a level of storage so that there is some flex on flying or expected to up group. Can you just go through that again, sorry? James Squires : Yes. That's right, Allison. That's how we calculate that number. And we do it that way because we want to focus on the velocity of our entire car fleet, including those that are in storage. So that we're -- that's an asset that remains on the books, and we want to make sure that it, too, is being taken into account as we think about utilization of the freight car asset. Michael Wheeler : Yes. This is Mike. Of that 129,000, we have 17,000 cars in storage that is available to us to flex up when the business arrives, and we're pretty excited about that. Unidentified Analyst : Great. And then just, obviously, you're well into your strategic plan. Looking back over the past few months, what's been your greatest surprise in terms of your ability to perform in this environment? James Squires : I think Mark did a good job describing the progress that we have made, the core operating and core earnings improvement that we made in the fourth quarter. So the momentum stands out for all of us, I think, and that's not a surprise, and that we've been driving it. We've been focused on accelerating the improvements as we move throughout the year, and we did it in fourth quarter, and that will carry over into 2020 and beyond. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Kenneth Hoexter : Jim, maybe just expanding on that target or -- of the 235 basis points year-over-year, or maybe for Mark. But does that include the headwind of the incentive comp for turning the $40 million to $60 million real estate gains? And then maybe just your thoughts on what's going to happen with the employee base moving forward. Is this -- are you -- is this kind of the run rate level? Do you still see more productivity on the employee side? James Squires : Mark? Mark George : Yes. Ken, look, I think in terms of headcount, we've taken a lot out this year. There's actually more to come. So not only will we enjoy the benefit of the full year effect of those employees that came out in the back half of this year, but there are more to come in the beginning part of this year. And then frankly, we just have to see how volume shakes out and determine how much further we can go and absorb the volume that we're assuming to get returned in the back half of the year. Sorry, the first half of your question, Ken? Kenneth Hoexter : Was just to ensure that the 235 basis points improvement, which is great, but does it include the headwind of incentive comp... Mark George : It does. Kenneth Hoexter : And the real estate gains that you mentioned. That's all baked in, right? Mark George : It's all baked in, Ken. So the incentive comp returning to normal and the real estate gains being in that $40 million to $60 million in range. It's all part of the calculus. Kenneth Hoexter : It's a big number. And then I guess my follow up for Mike. Just note, it looked like you had no targeted improvement in the service delivery Index. Are you changing it to tighten your range? Or why would there not be given all the moves you're making in, I guess, a target for improvement there? Michael Wheeler : So overall, we're pretty happy with our customer service levels, and our customers are as well. I will say we are targeting tightening some of our windows for delivery to customer and be better on the consistency part. So that's a part of it, but it doesn't roll up necessarily into changes at the macro level. But yes, we're pleased with our service but we're going to continue to dial it in, get better and better in the trucks. Alan Shaw : Ken, if I could add something, we collaborate with our customers on our service targets. And Mike noted that for years, we've been putting service targets out there with our -- for our customers and sharing with them our performance. In 2019, we upped the ante. We went out in front of our customers and said, here's what's going to change. With PSR implementation, and here's how your service is going to improve. And then we delivered it. And as you're going to see, our PSR implementation continues to evolve. We continue to make improvements and we're putting a product out there that helps us compete with truck. And as the truck market tightens as we move throughout the year, it's going to be a growth driver for us. We're very confident in the quality of the product that we're delivering, and we're pricing to that effect. Operator : The next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Thomas Wadewitz : I wanted to see if you could offer some thoughts on 2 of the segments where you have not seen improvement yet. So I'm thinking your purchased services, would you expense -- would you expect that line to improve in 2020 or 2021 as a result of phase 3 and TOP21 or the terminal improvement program, how do we think about that line? And also maybe a little more on fuel efficiency. James Squires : Mark? Mark George : Yes. I'll take that, Tom. So look, purchased services. Clearly, there is intermodal terminal operating costs that are in there. I wouldn't call them strictly volume-variable. There is an element of fixed cost in there as well or committed cost in there. But bear in mind that in our purchase services category, we've also got other things that are not volume-variable. For example, a lot of the maintenance cost for the network that you don't capitalize flow through this line. So when you have repairs to rails and you have to maintain the trees and ensure that the lines are clear. A lot of the costs for maintenance of the infrastructure cannot be capitalized. It goes into this category. Building leases and rental costs are in there. And then the other piece that you have to bear in mind, Tom, is there's a fair amount of technology cost that flows through there, similar to what I described with maintenance.  There is a lot of the IT spend that can't be capitalized, runs through this line category. And frankly, it's a growing category. The good news, however, is a lot of those investments we're making in technology are delivering returns in [indiscernible] in the P&L, as you saw through the call today. So we're investing in things like automation. It allows us to leave ourselves of some headcount-related to more transactional tasks. And we expect to continue to invest in this technology element as well. So that's, in large part, why purchased services is not moving as quick as we like. All of that said, I've got to dig in there a little bit, and we've talked about it quite a bit. We've got to look at this bucket for opportunities in 2020. It is an area where I think it's right for us to dig into a little bit more.  Your second question on fuel. We made progress in Q4 with some levels of efficiency, and we're really relying on a step-change improvement going into 2020 in fuel. The team has organized well. We continue the upgrades from DC to AC. That provides a lot of benefits to us in many ways, including fuel, but on top of that, we're having deeper energy management penetration. And so it's clearly an area in 2020 that we hope to see significant progress on. Thomas Wadewitz : Just -- if I can get a brief follow up. Jim, I think there is maybe a little increase in discussion in December on volume sensitivity of the $60 million OR target for 2021. Your guidance for 2020 seems to indicate there's not a lot of concern about volume. But how should we broadly think about the volume sensitivity of getting to $60 million? Do you need to improve volume growth in 2021? Or how do we broadly think about that? James Squires : Well, let me say first, this is a cost-structure, cost-reduction based plan, particularly in 2020, where we forecast flat revenue. So it's always all about achieving the efficiencies that we've tried to lay out for you that we have achieved already in 2019 and then rolling into this year and next. As far as 2021 is concerned, maybe get a little bit of a tailwind from some growth at that point. But we're not factoring in a lot. It remains fundamentally in an efficiency-oriented financial plan even as we move into 2021. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Christian Wetherbee : I wanted to dig in a little bit on the coal outlook, if we could, specifically maybe exports. Can we -- Alan, can you help us understand a little bit better, how we should be thinking about I think there's 2 impacts here, probably 1 on the volume side and then on the yield side. Maybe sequentially on the yield, should we see -- expect a step down in 1Q as some of these contracts get reset based on commodity prices? And then how should we think about the volume? Just trying to put some numbers around the coal headwinds we're looking at in 2020. Alan Shaw : All right. Chris, let's refresh where we were as we move through 2019 and first quarter and second quarter 2019. Net coal prices were above $205 a metric ton. And then they started cascading down to around $160 in the third quarter and a closer to $140, $145 in the fourth. And so as we've talked about frequently, we saw sequential declines in both volume and in price in our met coal franchise, which is -- export franchise, which is about 2/3 of our export coal, which makes up about 25% of our overall coal volume. Right now where coal prices are now, it's in the low $150s. You're going to see a lot of pressure on price. And just recall, Chris that our RPU and export coal met was at its highest point in the first quarter of last year as prices were at the highest point. And so you -- comps. Comps are most difficult in the beginning of the year. There's not a lot of demand in Europe. And as a result, you're seeing coals sourced from other locations globally are being put out onto the water. And so there's increased competition for us there. Then of course, you know what's going on with thermal. That is going to have a market impact on export thermal volumes. So you're going to see volume pressure in both met and thermal exports, and you're going to see particular price pressure on net exports. Christian Wetherbee : Okay. And the yield pressure is toughest in the first part of the year 2020? Alan Shaw : Relative to last year, yes. Christian Wetherbee : Got it. Okay. All right. No. That's helpful. And then, Jim, maybe a bigger picture question, coming back to the last one about OR in 2021 and some of your thoughts there. So some significant improvement this year and expectations for 2020. When we think about maybe some of those tailwinds that you could get from revenue growth, potentially returning in 2021. And given the progress you've made so far, how do you think about sort of the potential of the business? So I think a lot of us spend time focusing on your performance relative to peers. Is that the right way we should be thinking about it? So some of the numbers that we're seeing from some of the other rails out there. Are those the types of potential ORs we can expect from Norfolk over time? Just want to get a sense of how you're feeling about it kind of partway through this PSR initiative. James Squires : Should we see upside in the top line, we would expect much of it to flow through operating income and to the bottom line because there will be significant operating leverage in that growth. That's not our base case as we've been through, but the growth will return and resume at some point. We think we get a lot of operating leverage because we have restructured our costs and believe that we can handle volume growth with the resources on hand. Now there will be areas where we have to increase spending to handle the volume growth depending on how much it is. But by and large, we believe we can handle the volume when it returns with our existing resources. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Brandon Oglenski : I guess, Jim, maybe following off that line of questions. As we look at phase 3 of the TOP21 plan, is that going to drive pretty significant operational changes here, and that's why you guys have the confidence on the cost outlook and the OR improvement in 2020? James Squires : That will contribute to it and for all the reasons that the last major iteration of TOP21 drove efficiencies. So yes, that's a piece of this. In the next iteration of TOP21, we will continue to focus on train consolidations, on decreasing circuity on running longer, heavier trains to meet the goals that we put out there for those things. So it's really -- it's further to the types of goals that we were pursuing in the previous versions of the plan. I think at some point going forward, this becomes continuous improvement. And really, in a way, we're already there. We are looking every day, every week at shorter trains and working on a plan in consultation with our customers in the field to fold those trains into the network and achieve those efficiencies on an ongoing continual basis. Brandon Oglenski : Okay. I appreciate that response. And not to get too specific on this call. But Mark, can you talk to the other expense line item? Because I think if we look at it, the last few quarters, it was running around a $60 million run rate. Is that the right level to think in 2020? Mark George : Other expense? Brandon Oglenski : Yes. Mark George : Hang on. Yes. That's about the right level to be thinking about it, Brandon. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Justin Long : So maybe to start with the quarter, there were some onetime items that you've called out in the prepared remarks. So I was wondering if you could just help us understand if all of these items were baked into the guidance that you gave for 2019. I just wanted to get a better understanding of how things performed operationally in the fourth quarter versus what you expected? James Squires : Refer to Mark's opening slide for the components of the OR change and the EPS change, some of which were nonrecurring, others of which represent core earnings production during the quarter. Mark? Mark George : Yes. So when you go back to the appendix chart, basically, the property sale, we -- in 2018, we knew when we were building the 2020 -- sorry, the 2019 plan that we wouldn't be having a similar sale of that size. But the receivable write-off and the two asset impairments that we incurred in Q2 and Q4 were unforeseen. So those impacts are clearly not contemplated when the 2019 guidance was given. James Squires : And there were some other things that the taxes were lower. Mark George : Yes. James Squires : And tax rate was lower in the fourth quarter. That was not how we projected when we gave the guidance on the quarter. Mark George : So basically, think about it as those 3 roads, the receivable write-off asset impairment and the retroactive income tax credit were the surprises to us at the time of guidance a year ago. Justin Long : Okay. Great. That's really helpful. And then secondly, I wanted to ask about Intermodal. Would love to get your thoughts on domestic intermodal growth this year? And what you're expecting? And then just from a margin perspective in Intermodal, as PSR gets fully implemented? And how do you expect incremental margins within Intermodal to stack up relative to the rest of the business? I know historically, you've talked about intermodal incrementals being lower than general merchandising coal. I'm just wondering if that rank order could change post PSR. James Squires : Alan? Alan Shaw : Justin, we are expecting some growth in our intermodal franchise as the year progresses. As I noted, we're collaborating with our customers to look for logistics solutions that fit their needs. And we're really fortunate because we're aligned with the best channel partners in the business, and they're focused on growth. They understand our network. And so we're collaborating to see where we can compete with truck. We're encouraged to see an inflection in spot rates and truck. We haven't seen like a big uptick in it. So the first order -- or first derivative isn't all that great, but the second derivative is. I mean it's certainly stabilized and is improving, and that's going to provide some headroom for incremental volumes for intermodal as the year progresses. In addition to new service projects -- products that we're launching. And as we go through TOP21 V 3, we're going to look at consolidating some business. We're also going to look at reopening some lights and introducing new businesses for us. James Squires : And Justin, in terms of the incrementals within the intermodal sector. I would say this, for the last couple of years, the incrementals have actually been excellent during periods in which we were growing volume. The -- just looking back historically, one of the things that did hold intermodal incrementals back a little bit was fixed costs associated with the intermodal volume growth i.e. terminals and equipment costs. There -- as Mark went through, we're very focused on asset cost in this plan. And in the case of intermodal, making maximum use of the assets that we have, the terminals, the equipment that we have today. And keeping to a minimum, the growth CapEx that we're putting into that business. So lots of initiatives around terminal improvement processes and particularly in the environment we're in, keeping a lid on equipment costs. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Walter Spracklin : So just going back to the materials and other line item, forgetting for now -- I just want to be clear, forgetting for now the fourth quarter 2018 impact. And just looking at your quarterly run rate through 2019, you were averaging anywhere from $190 million $196 million, and you stepped down to $130 million in the fourth quarter. Is that all due to the gain that you had in the fourth quarter? And can you tell us exactly what the gain was, the amount of the gains in the fourth quarter? Mark George : That was the property gain. The absence of the property gain from last year, which was $112 million. Walter Spracklin : Yes. No, I'm talking -- forget last year. I'm just talking the cadence of the materials and other line expense in the -- through 2019, was $190 million, and it stepped down to $60 million in the fourth quarter. I'm just trying to understand what caused the quarter sequential step down from what was $190 million per quarter through 2019 to drop to $130 million? James Squires : Some of that was the efficiencies that we achieved in material spending in the fourth quarter, as Mark went through. This is 1 efficiency pickup by virtue of having a smaller locomotive fleet. And a car fleet out there, where we incur lower equipment maintenance expense. Walter Spracklin : So what was the gains in the quarter, I guess, is the question I'm asking. James Squires : Mark? Mark George : It was around $40 million -- $45 million. Walter Spracklin : So you were guiding at the beginning of the year for $30 million to $40 million for the full year, and you did $45 million in the fourth quarter. Is that -- am I getting that right? Alan Shaw : $40 million to $60 million. Mark George : Well, we're guiding now $40 million to $60 million. I don't know what was said in the beginning of the call. James Squires : I mean we've always said that this is going to be lumpy and unpredictable. And now you do tend to get more real estate closings at the end of the year. I think that probably is a pattern that you see a little bit better gain in the fourth quarter. But it is -- we've produced about $40 million to $60 million, excluding one-off gains like we had in the fourth quarter of 2018. That's about what we'd like to do going forward. But it will vary by quarter from time to time. Walter Spracklin : Okay. So you were at $30 million to $40 million embedded in your guidance for 2019 at the beginning of the year. And now it came in, as I understand, at $40 million to $60 million, of which $45 million was included in the fourth quarter? James Squires : Right, right. Mark George : Correct. Walter Spracklin : Okay. Got it. Okay. Mark George : So we ended the year kind of at that closer to $60 million. Walter Spracklin : $60 million, okay, of which $45 million was all in the fourth quarter? Mark George : That's correct. Walter Spracklin : Got it. Okay. And then on the tax side or the tax, I've got -- is it --- so '19 of retroactive tax adjustment would get your effective tax rate back up to around 22%, still trending fairly quite a bit below where -- was there anything else in the quarter versus the guidance that you were giving before, 23% to 24%? Or is that just a lower tax rate? Mark George : Yes. We had more benefits than we assumed from the coal gains, which are tax exempt. In addition, we have the 45G tax credits that we just talked about and disclosed, but there was also higher deductions from stock-based compensation. So everything kind of just went in the right direction for us this year. So that's why the ETR ended a little bit lower than what we would typically guide. Walter Spracklin : Is there something that you would call out as just kind of an exceptional number because I don't mind lower taxes on lower expenses? But that tax -- retroactive tax adjustment. Is there anything else that was onetime in that quarter that would... Mark George : No, there was nothing out-of-period in the quarter. No. Walter Spracklin : Okay. Okay, okay. And last question here is on the revenue -- so your revenue's flat for next year. The guidance that you had given through the year, last year was a little bit more on the optimistic side. Obviously, a lot of things happened unexpectedly. What confidence do you have that, while you're giving flat guidance? It is above your peer. Are you being a little bit more optimistic? Is there just the coal markets that you serve are just a little bit more advantageous. Can you give us a sense of what comfort you have that flat and rebounding off, I think you said Q1 will be the same as Q4, which is coming off a minus 7% base. That suggests it's going to be a pretty hefty growth rate, offset in the back half of the year. James Squires : Alan? Alan Shaw : Yes. Walter, our growth is targeted towards the back half of the year, and it's reflecting the strength of our intermodal franchise and some revenue growth within merchandise, and it's about launching new products that generate revenue growth with our customers. We're confident that we're going to be able to execute it. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JP Morgan. Brian Ossenbeck : A question for Mike on train ways. Can you just clarify -- if you said that the second half met the target when you put anything plan. Was that the new or the old target that you were tracking against? And then if you can just comment on the level of confidence you have in meeting new target, especially if coal declines more than expected, maybe have some mix shift that goes towards the lighter intermodal or even if volumes come in lower than you would think at this point? Alan Shaw : Yes. So that was against our 2019 goal. And the -- so for the full year, we met that goal for the back half, like we said we would on the calls with just TOP21 rolled in and drove train weight increases, particularly in the Merchandise market. So our Merchandise trains continue to be strong and growing in train length. Intermodal is not, and that's an area we have to continue to focus on. And the phase 3 of the TOP21 plan does that. Brian Ossenbeck : Okay. So despite the lower mix of coal, the key is really phase 3 in terms of building bigger and longer trains, even if volumes are flat or approximately down? Alan Shaw : So it's phase 3. And it's what Jim talked about, this continued optimization of the network. We continually look at trains that aren't running its size as we want them to and find ways to make them bigger and without affecting service. And we're doing that as we speak. Brian Ossenbeck : A quick follow up for Mark, if I could. Just on the CapEx. You mentioned you're taking a look at some of the line items, trying to figure out the spending level. Obviously, it's a short time in the seat for now, but just want to make sure I wasn't reading too much into that because clearly Norfolk has a heavy locomotive rebuild program, but clearly, your peers are spending, in some cases, quite a bit less from a CapEx intensity. So maybe you can just expand on that a little bit? Mark George : Yes. Look, right now, the way we spend our CapEx budget, as Jim said, it's between 16% and 18% of revenue. Roughly 60% of that is supporting the core network. It's the maintenance of way and it's the rail replacement ties and ballast. We put roughly 20% for the locomotive upgrades. And that's, again, the DC to AC conversions. And as I've learned, this replacement approach is actually generating very reliable product that's performing very well in the field, and it's actually much cheaper than buying newer locomotives. So that's logical. And then the other 20% bucket is comprised of a lot of other things, but primarily IT spend and digital technology spend. So that's kind of how we break down our CapEx. I'm getting in, and I'm just trying to understand it because it's -- obviously, it's a big use of funds for us, and we want to just -- I want to understand the disciplines around it and just pressure test a lot of the assumptions that have been in there on the adequacy and how much we need to spend. I'm not -- we're not -- that's not to say that we're going to change the guidance anytime soon. I'm just letting you know that coming in fresh, because it was in response to that question, what are the things that surprised me, it was looking at this level of spend and as I learned the industry, I'm understanding it better, but it doesn't mean I'm not going to bring a different lens to it and push a little. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen and Company. Jason Seidl : I want to go back to international intermodal. Clearly, there were some headwind pull forward in 4Q. But if I recall that actually pushed into 1Q a little bit. When should we see the inflection point of those volumes turning up? And does the uncertainty of the coronavirus actually impact you guys at all? Or is that too early to tell yet. James Squires : Alan? Alan Shaw : Jason, you're absolutely correct. We did see elevated international intermodal volumes in the first couple of months of 2019. And so as the year progresses, comps will get a little bit easier for us. And then that's where we're expecting to start seeing growth. With respect to the coronavirus, it doesn't help. There's no doubt about that. We've talked to our customers about that and the level of impact that they're anticipating is unknown at this point. It's all speculation. So we're paying close attention to it as are the steamship lines that we serve. Jason Seidl : Okay. And my follow up is going to be on the domestic side of things. A couple of railroads, let's call it, the last 1.5 years, pulled back a little bit on some of the lanes that they serve with PSR. Do you think that there is a need for more lanes going forward once the market does tighten up in the U.S. truckload? Or do you think the lanes that the industry currently has are good enough to service and get that freight back from the highways onto the railroads? Alan Shaw : Well, Jason, I think there's both. I think we're going to see, as the truck market tightens, we're going to see the benefits of our powerful intermodal franchise and organic growth in the lanes that we serve. And then as I noted, we're working feverishly with our interline partners and with our customers to look at new lanes that offer value to our customers and offer value to our shareholders. So this is not static. It's a dynamic review of our overall franchise, finding areas where we can provide value, and we can support our channel partner's growth. And as I noted, we're aligned with the best channel partners in the industry. So I'm pretty confident that collaborating together, we're going to find avenues for growth. Operator : Our next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. David Vernon : I wanted to ask a little bit about where we should be expecting headcount to come in, in 2020? Ended the year down pretty considerably. And should we be expecting that kind of run rate level? Or should we be expecting further reductions from that from where we ended the year on headcount. James Squires : Mark? Mark George : We're not going to provide a specific headcount number. We are coming down again from the -- where we're going to end 2019, for sure. But as I mentioned, we're going to keep pushing it, and then we're going to see where volume goes. As we talked about, we're expecting volume to start turning a little bit for us a little bit in the back half. And if it's not there, we're going to continue to push on employment levels. But we don't have a specific number to share with you. David Vernon : Nothing in the budget that you could give us a sense for how much additional sort of headcount reduction there should be in the year? Mark George : No, I mean we clearly have a budget but it is not going to be something that we talk about because we will flex, just like this year, depending on where volume is, we may go heavier. James Squires : So you certainly saw, David, in the fourth quarter when we had to flex we do, and we did. And we pick up the pace throughout the second half, particularly in the fourth quarter. So we will do what's necessary. David Vernon : Okay. And then, I guess, maybe just kind of sequentially, Mark, the other expense line came in at $11 million for the fourth quarter from $95 million in 3Q, 60s in 1 and 2Q. Is there anything that explains that sort of sequential step down in the other expense line for 4Q? Mark George : Yes, it's a little bit of the land sale, is the gains that we had that were back-end loaded from the property sales that we talked about. So we had more land sales that came through in the fourth quarter compared to the prior 3. Operator : Our one final question coming from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Jordan Alliger : Just a quick question. A lot of talk on the domestic intermodal front. But I'm just curious can you talk about international, what proportion of your intermodal franchise is international, whether it be volume or revenue? And how do you think about that as we approach 2020, given still the noise around tariffs? And I'm just sort of curious also what the how that -- the international franchise actually performed in 2019? Just a relative sense for looking forward? Alan Shaw : Jordan, our International Intermodal franchise is about 35% of our overall intermodal franchise as measured by volume. As I noted earlier, it -- we're running up against some pretty tough comps to start the year with the pull forward of activity in the fourth quarter of 2018 that bled over into the first quarter of 2019. We're expecting that it will -- the comps will improve as the year progresses. But as with all of our markets, we're generally not expecting growth until the second half of the year. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Squires for closing comments. James Squires : Thank you, everyone. We appreciate your questions this morning and look forward to talking with you again when we announce our first quarter 2020 earnings. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Pete Sharbel, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. Mr. Sharbel, you may begin. Pete Sharbel : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Please note that during today\u2019s call, we may make certain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, and may differ materially from actual results. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. Our presentation slides are available at norfolksouthern.com in the Investors section, along with our non-GAAP reconciliation. Additionally, a transcript and downloads will be posted after the call. It is now my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern\u2019s Chairman, President and CEO, Jim Squires. Jim Squires : Good morning, everyone. And welcome to Norfolk Southern\u2019s first quarter 2020 earnings call. Joining me today are Alan Shaw, Chief Marketing Officer; Mike Wheeler, Chief Operating Officer; and Mark George, Chief Financial Officer. Before we discuss our financial results, I\u2019d first like to thank our employees for their dedication during these unprecedented times. Norfolk Southern employees are proud to be delivering an essential service. In a video message to employees dispatcher Misty Brayton expressed the sentiment well when she said, we supply America with the goods that they are short of right now. And I hope everybody that works for Norfolk Southern feels essential after this. It is truly inspirational to watch our employees rise to the challenge. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we established three simple goals early on, protect our employees, serve our customers and exercise strong financial discipline. I will talk briefly about the steps we are taking in each area. Our first responsibility is to protect our people. We acted quickly based on CDC guidelines and took extensive measures to keep employees safe. We transitioned most of our office employees to remote work in a matter of days. For employees whose jobs require them to work on site, we implemented social distancing and established rigorous cleaning protocols for their work environments. Our preventive measures, combined with the diligence of our employees have kept the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases at Norfolk Southern low. I am also pleased to report that our employees are working safely through the many potential distractions. Our thoughts are with all those whose lives have been impacted by the virus. Our second goal is to continue providing an excellent service product for our customers and that\u2019s exactly what we are doing. Our customers are making rapid adjustments to their operations due to the impacts of the Coronavirus and we are right there with them every day as a valued partner. They count on us for reliable service, close collaboration and nimble operational adjustments and we are delivering. We will address our third goal, which is to exercise strong financial discipline throughout the balance of this call. The work we have done to implement our strategic plan has made us an even more resilient business, putting us in a good position to navigate the current market disruption. I will now turn to our financial results for the quarter. Allow me to first remind everyone of our announcement on April 16th of a non-cash charge of $385 million related to the ongoing disposition of 703 locomotives. Thanks to the excellent execution of our strategic plan, our fleet today is more efficient and we are able to operate with significantly fewer locomotives. Mark will provide additional color. But as you can see on slide five, we have provided an adjusted view of our financials to exclude this charge. This is what I will reference in the rest of my comments this morning. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $2.58 and the adjusted operating ratio was 63.7%. These numbers improved upon last year\u2019s record results by 3% and 230 basis points, respectively. Within the context of an 11% volume decline, they are remarkable achievements that demonstrate this team\u2019s urgency to transform our company. We also set records and metrics such as train performance, terminal dwell and shipment consistency among others and accelerated crew start reductions in excess of declining volumes for a third straight quarter. When coupled with the ongoing realignment of resources around our new operating model, we reduced operating expenses by $202 million in the first quarter when excluding the non-cash locomotive charge. Our team is committed to driving improvements across the network and significantly and consistently lowering our operating ratio. We are focused on the factors within our control and confident that by continuing to adjust and successfully execute our strategic plan, we are building a stronger, more resilient and a more profitable Norfolk Southern. I will now turn the call over to Alan and the team to begin detailing our first quarter results and our progress executing the strategic plan. Alan? Alan Shaw : Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. The first quarter started with the impact of low natural gas prices and mild weather on our coal franchise. In February, we saw the initial impacts of the COVID-19 crisis, impacting international intermodal volume. As COVID-19 evolved into a global pandemic, a majority of our markets experienced volume declines, with business levels further impacted by plummeting energy prices. In the face of this challenging environment, we are flexible and responsive to market changes and customer needs, adjusting our operating plan and resources where necessary. We remain focused on our long-term strategy with an emphasis on superior service to our customers and margin improvement, demonstrated by consistent growth in revenue per unit and revenue per revenue ton-mile over the last three years. Our service is the best in Norfolk Southern history, a testament to the commitment of our employees to respond to rapidly evolving customer requirements and deliver an exceptional service product, while producing structural and volumetric improvements to our cost. Moving to slide seven. The impacts of COVID-19, energy and excess truck capacity lowered our revenue by 8%, with the volume decline partially offset by RPU less fuel growth in all three business groups, marking our 13th consecutive quarter of delivering year-over-year RPU growth. Merchandised revenue was down 1%. As record RPU, partially offset a 5% volume decrease. Automotive car loads declined due to plant shutdowns late in the quarter in response to COVID-19. Steel volumes continued to be impacted by weak demand and frac sand faced pressure from low energy prices, while favorable spreads allowed increases in crude oil volumes. Intermodal revenue declined 9% driven by a loose truck market, lower demand and the early negative impacts of COVID-19 in our International Group. RPU gains propelled by our strong service product offset some of the impacts of the volume decline. Coal volumes and revenue were both down 31% year-over-year, driven by extremely low natural gas prices throughout the mild winter. Our export franchise also experienced slight volume losses due to low seaborne pricing. Moving to our outlook on slide eight. We continue to monitor the combination of COVID-19 pandemic and energy decline and the unprecedented impact on our markets. We project year-over-year volume declines across all business groups with large impacts in the second quarter and future volumes dependent upon the depth of the downturn and the timing of the reopening of the economy, as well as energy prices. We are partnering with our customers to affect necessary short-term adjustments that allow for quick and decisive reactions to market changes, remaining in close collaboration with our customers and economic allies that place their confidence in Norfolk Southern. The chart on slide eight classifies our markets by revenue and the sensitivity to both COVID-19 and energy. The agriculture, forest and consumer group includes among other markets, food products, which remain in high demand and ethanol, which will decline due to demand and energy prices. Lower consumer spending and disruptions in the supply chain will likely continue to impact automotive intermodal and other consumer-driven products. Intermodal will be further influenced by low oil prices and the associated competitive dynamics with truck. Shutdowns in automotive and other manufacturing will drive declines in the already soft steel market. Our crude market will be adversely impacted by low energy prices and decreased demand from COVID-19 disruptions. Natural gas prices and mild weather coupled with declining industrial and commercial load will negatively impact our utility market. Lastly, export coal will continue to be pressured by lower seaborne coal prices and COVID-19. We maintain strong customer relationships, built on a collaboration and constant communication, which facilitated our flawless implementation of PSR last year. We continue this approach as we adjust our network to conserve resources, while continuing to meet our customer\u2019s needs. The economic headwinds will significantly impact 2020 revenue. The strength of our franchise, our commitment, the collaboration, deep customer relationships and superior service product provide the foundation for success through this downturn and as economic conditions improve. Our portfolio ranches from the most powerful intermodal franchise in the east to broad participation in over 50% of the consumer, industrial and energy markets that drive the U.S. economy. We are leveraging our deep market knowledge to partner with our customers, innovate logistic solutions for evolving supply chain requirements, securing new opportunities in the near-term and for when markets normalize. I will now turn it over to Mike for an update on operations. Mike Wheeler : Thank you, Alan. Today, I will update you on the state of our operations. The first quarter continued our story of superior service and improved cost structure, leading to increased operational leverage even in the face of declining volumes. We are continually improving our operating plan and using PSR principles to deliver superior execution. Going to slide 10. Continued improvements in train speed and terminal dwell despite tougher year-over-year comps drove record quarterly terminal dwell, train performance, customer service at the car load level and unprecedented executional success in the service sensitive intermodal segment. We achieved these milestones with fewer assets and lower employment levels, further reducing our cost structure and driving efficiency. These trends have continued into the second quarter. Moving onto our service and productivity metrics on slide 11, which I have shared with you in prior calls. These metrics measure important productivity and customer service levels and are indicators of our success meeting our productivity goals. The service delivery index measures our on-time performance at the shipment level and is indexed to 2018. Our first quarter 2020 performance is at our 2021 goal and we are confident we will maintain these service levels throughout the year. Our lowest T&E headcount on record drive substantial year-over-year productivity, while still providing stellar service. As I will show you on the next slide, we continue to aggressively size our train plan to the changing business levels. We continued our momentum of train weight improvements, showing further progress in the first quarter. Remember that we re-targeted this goal 6,700 tons in light of continued changes in the coal market. Productivity driven by our top 21 operating plan will boost us towards this goal, despite the challenges of the current volume environment. We made considerable progress in locomotive productivity in 2019 by rationalizing our fleet, a trend that continued in the first quarter of 2020. Our active locomotive fleet is almost 15% lower in 2020 than in the first quarter of 2019 and our recent locomotive disposition announcement reinforces our commitment to getting the most out of our fleet. We also thought it would be useful to show you our year-over-year progress in fuel efficiency. This is an area of focus for us and the improvements in gallons per ton-mile reflect the results of efforts on many fronts, including increased train weight, continued rationalization of the DC to AC upgrade of our locomotive fleet, increased use of energy management technology and completion of our full PTC footprint. Finally, even after we raised the bar on the Cars On-Line goal, we continue to beat our targets. First quarter results were measurably better than goal and we set a new record earlier this month. To be clear, this count includes cars in storage that can be brought out as business rebounds. Slide 12 shows our fifth consecutive quarter of accelerated reductions in crew starts. We are continuously improving our TOP21 plan and are now completing Phase 3 of the program. This will deliver the three phases of the program in 18 months, instead of the anticipated three years. The first quarter saw 19% fewer crew starts, showing increased leverage between crew starts and volume. After we complete Phase 3 of TOP21, we will continue to optimize the operating plan, in part by combining traffic of all types on single trains and reviewing our yard network for further rationalization. Before I shift to discussing Norfolk Southern\u2019s operational response to the COVID-19 pandemic, I want to emphasize our positive operational momentum. We are making progress long-term structural changes in our asset base, service levels and productivity drivers. We will continue to build on our progress from 2019, following PSR principles while proactively adapting our operating plan to the economic environment. Turning to slide 13. I am very proud of how Norfolk Southern\u2019s railroaders have dealt with both the threat and the business impact of the pandemic. We took early proactive measures to protect our workforce and make sure that being at work, continue to be the safest part of an NS employees day, because the railroad was very fluid and service levels were very high, we were able to quickly store surplus equipment, while also mobilize employees to provide extra manpower in hot zones like Northern New Jersey. We made special efforts to assist customers by expediting shipments of goods in short supply or that were urgently needed. All the while, we maintain service levels and the railroad has run even faster in April. As you can see on slide 14, the pandemic also mandated a proactive response to the drop in volume. Tactically, we very quickly over just a few days removed the blocks and trains carrying auto parts and finished vehicles from our TOP21 plan. Crew starts dropped almost as quickly as volume, enabling us to preserve leverage even as shipment count declined. We will again redesign the operating plan as auto volume rebounds, using our operating leverage to handle returning volumes in the most efficient way possible. While we do not yet know the shape of the recovery curve, we are taking this time of lower traffic as an opportunity to challenge ourselves and our capabilities to improve our TOP21 operating plan in the long-term. For example, we are successfully handling carload traffic on premium intermodal trains, lending previously separate service networks in a way that allows us to maintain service frequency and train size while reducing costs. In addition, we are taking hard looks at our yard and terminal network, testing what we can live without. I will now turn it over to Mark, who will cover the financials. Mark George : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Before I get into the review of adjusted financials, just a moment to talk about the locomotive write-down that we disclosed two weeks ago, simply said, it\u2019s a capacity dividend of our TOP21 PSR implementation, which has resulted in the decongestion of our yards and road network, allowing cars to turn quicker in the terminals and trains to move faster on the network. The blending of our discrete networks resulted in fewer but longer trains, fewer trains along with better balancing of our routes require fewer locomotives. We enter 2020 with roughly 1,000 locomotives on the sidelines, out of the approximate fleet of 3,900. We spent time this quarter aligning on exactly how many locomotives we would need even at 2018 volume levels. Our operations team essentially modeled the capacity requirements in a post PSR world and determined that of our stored locomotives 703 are deemed excess and available for sale, while the balance are held for surge and in cycle for AC upgrades. In fact, 298 of the 703 were effectively sold in Q1, while the remaining will be marketed for sale or scrapped in the next 12 months. The $385 million is essentially the remaining book value on those locomotives that otherwise would have been depreciated in the P&L in the years to come. In the process, the team targeted removal of the oldest, least reliable and least efficient of the locomotives and eliminated entire model lines, moving us to a more homogenous fleet of 10 models from \u201819. With that we were able to also eliminate inventory and rationalize mechanical resources. So moving now to slide 17 and the remaining slides will reflect adjusted results, excluding the impact from the locomotive rate down. Recall this slide format we introduced last quarter to show large and anomalous events that impact our results. There is just one item in the quarter worth calling out and that is a one-time benefit on an income tax refund related to the 2012 tax year. That provided $0.09 of EPS tailwind in the quarter and contributed to the 12.6% effective tax rate. No other meaningful adjustments in Q1 of 2019 or 2020, so the improvement in the operating ratio of 230 basis points was core. Now moving to the adjusted results on slide 18, a very strong operational quarter, as both Jim and Mike described earlier. Revenue was down 8% driven by an 11% volume contraction that was partially offset by the strong RPU improvement that Alan spoke to. Thanks to our effective yield-up strategy enabled by our enhanced customer service delivery. Operating expenses were 11% lower, almost mitigating the revenue decline in dollar terms and that resulted in the strong 230 basis point OR improvement, which follows the 240 basis point core OR improvement we showed in Q4, despite a softer environment during that time. And you see on the right, very strong free cash flow performance, a record $589 million, which is 42% greater than Q1 of last year. So now drilling into the operating expense categories on slide 19, we drove down compensation and benefits in the quarter, 14% year-over-year on a 19% reduction in employees versus Q1 of 2019. Employee count was down 6% sequentially from Q4. Our employment levels declined throughout the quarter and this along with lower costs associated with benefits, over time, re-crews and incentive compensation saved us $105 million. Fuel was down $61 million from a combination of lower prices, as well as lower consumption from both volume and also efficiency gains. Consumption declined 15% on a 10% decrease in GTMs, despite significant adverse commodity mix. Materials and other spending was down $24 million or 13% led by a $15 million reduction in materials. Gains on operating properties amounted to $11 million, which was lower than the $17 million recorded in Q1 of 2019. Purchased services and rents was down $21 million or 5% with purchase services alone down 7%. Rents were actually up 5% in the quarter due to lower equity income from the TTX joint venture that more than offset savings from lower rent spend. So when looking at the big picture, the underlying change to our cost structure continue to shine through in the first quarter, as we reduce and realigned resources around our new operating model. Moving to slide 20. Let\u2019s take a look at our summarized first quarter financial results below the income from operations line. Other income was down $22 million from lower investment returns on corporate-owned life insurance and a lower effective tax rate of 12.6% was driven by the refund I discussed earlier, as well as benefits from stock-based compensation. This first quarter low ETR will provide benefit to the full-year effective tax rate as we expect the remaining quarters to return to the guidance range of 23% to 24%. Moving now to slide 21, as mentioned, we generated a record Q1 free cash flow of $589 million. Thanks to expanding margins, but also from constraining our capital spend, which was $100 million less than last year. And we returned $708 million to shareholders in the quarter, with a solid dividend bolstered by our continued share repurchase activity. Now let\u2019s talk outlook on slide 22. Obviously, the economic environment has progressively worsened here in Q2 and while we can\u2019t be certain of the severity and duration of the downturn in 2020, we do know that revenue will be much lower than we thought at the beginning of the year. So we pulled our guidance for flat revenue for 2020, as well as the guidance for OR improvement. We are modeling a number of revenue scenarios, so that we are positioned to respond as a scenario starts to play out. We are focused on what we can control, service and costs. We feel that with modest revenue contractions, we can manage to match it with cost takeout. With steep revenue declines, you just can\u2019t keep up with certainly not in the short-term. To help you in your modeling and for illustrative purposes, you see the P&L cost categories that provide a general sense, how they correlated the volume changes. Most categories have an element of cost that is directly tied to volume, and on a mostly immediate basis, fuel being the most obvious, but there are also structural components that take longer to move, as well as great areas that are also subject to volume, but pretty dependent on management decisions that are influenced by the expected duration of the downturn and the anticipated pace of recovery. We never want to cut in a way where we can handle volume when a recovery occurs, which would then adversely impact customer service. And we absolutely won\u2019t compromise on network safety. In aggregate, roughly 50% to 60% of our costs could be categorized as volume variable and semi-variable. The balance is structural cost and there is a reason I refer to this category as structural instead of fixed which kind of its permanent. We have been and continue to work on structural cost trying to eliminate not just variabilize them and we are looking at all structural buckets including even the biggest one depreciation, a category that many would consider truly fixed. We have to look at how we can keep this bar from getting fatter and certainly adding fewer assets over time helps, but there are even unique opportunities to make it skinnier. Our recent locomotive action for example will generate roughly $25 million of annual depreciation savings going forward, so all structural cost is under constant review by this committed leadership team that\u2019s dedicated to evaluating all opportunities. So while our deep revenue decline may put short-term pressure on the OR, I have every confidence that when we are on the other side of this market dislocation, we will be coiled up with great operating leverage to deliver significant OR improvement. Let me wrap up on slide 23. Given the steep drop in the markets and the lack of clarity on the slope of recovery, it\u2019s important to share with you a bit about our financial standing. On top of significant expansion of free cash flow generation, we also maintain a solid balance sheet with good debt capacity and robust access to credit markets. We have relatively light levels of debt maturities in the next two years. More importantly, we have already significantly dial-back on our capital spend budget for 2020, recognizing the challenging environment that we are entering. Property additions will be limited to roughly $1.5 billion this year, regardless of revenue, which is a reduction from our 2019 spending levels by $500 million or 25%. If the right thing to do, it would be the lowest level of spend in absolute dollars since 2010, while not jeopardizing the safety, service or near-term revenue opportunities. So we feel real good about our liquidity and our ability to weather this storm. Thank you and I will turn the call back over to, Jim. Jim Squires : Thank you, Mark. There is much for us to be proud of in our report today, from our strong first quarter financial performance to the incredible job the men and women of Norfolk Southern are doing to keep the trains running. Our industry faces a difficult volume environment with an uncertain trajectory. By executing our strategic plan, exercising capital discipline and serving our customers well, Norfolk Southern is poised to emerge stronger and ready for growth as the economy recovers. Thank you for your attention and we will now open the line for Q&A. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is from Jason Seidl of Cowen. Please go ahead. Jason Seidl : Thank you, Operator. Gentlemen, good morning. I hope everyone is doing well. I wanted to jump on the outlook question. I think one of you mentioned sort of not cutting too much into the system, not only for safety but to handle the rebound whenever it does come. How much in expenses do you think you are holding in anticipation of that? Let\u2019s say, if you look at the automotive sector, for example, plants being shutdown, how much more expenses is Norfolk sort of maintaining right now and how do you think about forecasting some of these areas for head count or equipment demand? Jim Squires : Good morning, Jason. It\u2019s, Jim. We are committed to managing our volume variable and structural cost through this downturn. So you saw evidence of that in the first quarter with adjusted expense reductions totaling $202 million. We are pulling every lever at our disposal when it comes to cost reductions in this environment and that\u2019s the right thing to do given the trend in the revenue this year. Nevertheless, we do believe we are capable of responding to the upturn, which will come as volume growth resumes. We expect to generate significant operating leverage and that will result in rapid margin improvement and bottomline growth. Jason Seidl : And right now, how are you guys looking at the anticipated rebound, because clearly, we are going to see 2Q that\u2019s going to take a big step down, right, even from the weakness in 1Q? But what is Norfolk looking for in terms of a gradual recovery and how should we think about headcount throughout the system as we move throughout the quarters? Jim Squires : Well, growth will resume and when it does, as I said. We will have the resources in place and we expect to generate significant operating leverage. Let me talk a little bit further about kind of next steps in terms of cost reductions, and I will ask Alan to comment on the topline outlook. So we are pressing the TOP21 accelerator right now. And that, as Mike said, that means crew start reductions going forward, a hard look at our yard and facilities network, blending more trains, the kind of step straight out of the PSR playbook to continue to drive down costs. So, Alan, what about the revenue outlook? Alan Shaw : Hey. Good morning, Jason. We are staying very tight with our customers and modulating our expenses appropriately because we are going to make sure that we are there as they start to recover. The first step would be say reopening within auto manufacturing and that\u2019s generally targeted to start slowly, in the middle of May, that should pull some additional raw materials through the pipeline as well say steel for example and some plastics. And then, as I noted on Slide 8, it really is about just the reopening of the economy and improvement in energy prices. Resolution of that is open-ended and so it remains critical for us to stay close and tight with our customers as we plan going forward. Operator : The next question is from Allison Landry of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Allison Landry : Good morning. Thank you. So, good progress on the OR improvement in the first quarter. So, I know you withdrew the 2020 guidance expect some near-term margin pressure, but I don\u2019t think I heard you comment on the 2021 OR guidance, so is this intact and do you think a 60 is still achievable? Jim Squires : We did not pull our guidance for 60 in 2021 and we are still focused on getting to a 60 OR as fast as we can. The timing and shape of the recovery will likely have an impact for sure. But one thing is for certain, as I said, we get to the other side of this and growth resumes, our operating leverage would be very powerful and should drive rapid OR improvement in bottomline growth. Allison Landry : Okay. And then -- and just sort of in light of the collapse in volumes, are you seeing any increased resistance from customers with respect to the yield-up strategy. I think we have heard from a number of shippers that said they are being asked for monthly volume commitments and liquidated damages and exchange for one-year contracts. So just hoping to get your thoughts on whether this is leading to some share losses to truck and if you are considering any changes to the pricing strategy, in order to keep more volume on the network? Thank you. Alan Shaw : Allison, there are lot of unknowns in the market space right now. Our critical role in the nation\u2019s economy and our customer supply chains is clearly evident right now, that is not an unknown. We are pricing the value of our product, we are pricing of the value of our franchise and we are very confident in our understanding of the market. We are maintaining a long-term view of this and we are maintaining a long-term view of our business decisions to benefit our shareholders. We understand that eventually we are going to cycle through this market and we have got a great franchise and a great approach to support our customers\u2019 growth when that occurs. Operator : The next question is from Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Scott Group : Hey. Thanks. Good morning, guys. So, I want to ask a few things on the cost side, maybe just starting with labor comp per employee was up 6% sequentially -- 6%, sorry, 6% year-over-year. Any thoughts on how we should be thinking about comp per employee going forward and then any thoughts on where -- what you are doing with head count right now, given the volume environment? Jim Squires : Mark? Mark George : Yes. Scott, you are right, the comp per employee did move 6% sequentially. But remember, these are quarter-to-quarter in particular is very lumpy. And you are always going to have some noise on the timing of when you have incentive accrual top-ups or write-back. So I think you are got to look at it more over time and when you look at it over time, you are always going to be fighting inflation, wage inflation. So, that\u2019s certainly something that we are dealing with every year. And but generally, we are really shifting our focus to the absolute comp and win numbers, which as you know, have gone down and continued to decline in part from the volume, but in particular from the PSR actions that we have taken. Scott Group : I guess I am not sure I followed. So, like, so, as we think about going forward, I guess, was there anything unusual in this first quarter on the comp per employee or should we assume like that this level continues going forward, meaning, certainly\u2026 Mark George : Well, look\u2026 Scott Group : Meaning in the fourth -- in the first quarter you had headcount down 6% sequentially, but I think labor costs, total labor costs to your point were only down 1% or 2% sequentially? Mark George : You had some incentive accrual disparities between quarters. So that\u2019s one thing, where in Q4 you had -- based on the way the year ended, you ended up having a benefit or a pickup from writing back some of the incentive accruals. So that certainly dropped the Q4 number and creates a little bit of a tougher compared sequentially. I think from here, you will see that it\u2019s going to be more even throughout the year. Operator : The next question is from Brian Ossenbeck of JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Brian Ossenbeck : Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Mark, can you go back to the locomotive side and maybe just walk us through the potential benefits, some that you may be recognized or whether you called out like the depreciation? And then, secondly, out the different components on the labor side, maybe even further on the D&A side, on the efficiency side for fuel and just how do you think about what this has done for Norfolk so far and what it could represent in the future, your call this year and next year as it rolls out completely. Mark George : Sure. I mean, we talk a little bit about the locomotives, first. And again we took out 250 locomotives last year as we launch the TOP21 strategic plan and mainly those were on the sideline, but they were with a lot of other locomotives that we had on the sideline. We knew that every quarter throughout this year, we were probably going to see, we were going to convince ourselves that we were going to have more and more surplus locomotives. So rather than leak it out over time, we really held hands as an organization and said, look, we have got very good progress here on liberating assets in the field. Where can we be in a post-PSR world with regard to locomotive needs? And there were several iterations, I think, the PSR experts that we have in-house, really pushed the envelope and said, look, we know where we can get to. So, we had a 1,000 when we started the year on the sideline, the numbers initially started with 400, maybe 450, the team iterated several times and ultimately got back to a number of 703, where we said that is absolutely doable, even if we go back to 2018 volume levels, we can still manage with the remaining fleet. So we decided, rather than just leak this out over time to take a look at it, it was clearly a significant portion of the -- of that particular asset base. So we decided the right thing to do, the appropriate thing to do is actually pull it out of group accounting and write it off. The benefit of doing that, first off is, we get the organization focused on removing assets and I think that\u2019s a very important thing for any company when you have surplus assets is to eradicate them, because assets attract cost. You got yard congestion in our case. You have got network congestion by parking all these excess locomotives, let\u2019s commit to get rid of them quickly, and then they will attract less cost, less maintenance and less attention and less property tax whatever you can assign to it will end up being savings. So it\u2019s healthier just to get to recognize what surplus upfront and move as quick as possible to remove them from the company\u2019s properties. And then by removing them from group accounting, you also now have taken that $385 million asset and you avoid depreciating it over many years and absorbing it into your remaining assets, it seems like it\u2019s a very unusual form of accounting that\u2019s relatively unique to our industry, where you have group accounting attaching excess book value from discarded assets to remaining assets and depreciating further over time. So we avoid doing that, we get rid of it, we get depreciation benefit in the future. So that\u2019s really how this came about. Scott Group : Okay. Can you offer any commentary on this, what that means for maintenance or mechanical resources, fuel economy going from -- to a more homogenous fleet in anything beyond the D&A that you are looking to realize in the next couple of quarters or into \u201821? Mark George : Yes. Clearly, they attract less maintenance and part of that $385 million was a little bit of inventory that went for the model lines that are no longer here, the seven model lines we eliminated. So that\u2019s another trailing benefit that we have. And but, yes, clearly, we are going to have some mechanical benefit from this, savings that arise from having fewer locomotives and a more streamlined fleet model. Maybe, Mike, you want to make some comments. Mike Wheeler : Yeah. I mean, it helps your whole material network, because you are managing less, less materials with less models. A lot of these models were smaller type models and so that helped to be efficient. And it\u2019s also going to help our sharp footprint going forward as we continue to rationalize that, you have heard some of the things we are doing there and those are coming to fruition now and those will help that as well. So, yeah, there\u2019s a lot of ancillary benefits to this going forward. Mark George : And remember, Brian, we got rid of 300 of those already in Q1. So the physical assets have been removed and there is just the remaining 400 now, that over the next 12 months, hopefully in the next 9 months or so we will follow. Operator : The next question is from David Ross of Stifel. Please proceed with your question. David Ross : Yeah. Good morning, gentlemen. I wanted to talk a little bit about Phase 3 of TOP21. We mentioned combining the cars of all different types onto a single train. Where are you in that process, has that been done yet, what\u2019s left and how might mix in the second quarters, you are doing this, I would say not look normal depending on the restart of the economy in which commodity types come back online and is that going to create any issues at completing Phase 3? Jim Squires : Well, Mike went through the steps that we have taken under TOP21 and essentially we have completed all of the network redesign to this point that we had mapped out through 2021. So all phases of TOP21 that we had initially signaled we would implement, we have implemented at this point. Going forward, our focus, as we have said is on additional crew start reductions, blending more trains and a hard look at the facilities we use, the yards we use to support network operations. Mike, anything to add? Mike Wheeler : Yeah. We have been talking with you on all the quarters about our blending of our network. We first started talking about blending bulk into the general merchandise and we did that. And then we started blending the automotive into the general merchandise as well and that was a big part of TOP21 last year, very successful. And as we have continued on, we have blended general merchandise and bulk into the intermodal network that\u2019s been very successful. And then, now we are in the process of blending traffic even into our premium network. So we have really blended all of the different traffic types into our network. So we are to the point now where a train is a train. So our Phase 3 implementation is really in place. And the beauty of this, as you go forward and traffic comes back, we are blended now that a train is a train, and it can ride on a train that gives us the right service requirement that it needs, but also as efficient as it can be. So we are really in a good place with our network with the TOP21 implementation, and going forward, we are just going to continue to optimize the network as traffic comes back on. Mark George : And David, if I could add one thing, it also benefits us and our customers and that it provides us with a broader product offering, and no longer do we need to find enough density for a point to point intermodal train. We could find smaller blocks of intermodal and put it on a merchandise train and open up some lanes, which we are doing. David Ross : That\u2019s great color. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Jordan Alliger of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jordan Alliger : Hi. I just wanted to follow up a bit on the price for the yield question a bit, obviously, volumes have been impacted pretty heavily hearing thus far, as you said, I think, you mentioned down about 30%, which is trailing the industry for some degree. I am just curious -- at the same time, your yields are tending to be better, so I am just curious, some of the volume discrepancy maybe related to that or how do you deal with price for yield in the face of these steep declines going forward? Thanks. Jim Squires : Jordan, at Norfolk Southern, we are fierce competitors and we are determined to make decisions in the long-term, best interest of our shareholders. We have got a deep knowledge of our markets and we are confident in our ability to price to the value of our service product, which is outstanding and our franchise, with a focus on margin improvement and also providing our customers with a platform for growth and you can see this in our RPU, in revenue-to-revenue ton-mile trends over the last three years, it\u2019s a consistent and a strategic approach for us. There are some specific market forces that are impacting our volumes. Last year, 60% of our coal volume was in the utility coal network. That volume was down 44% in the first quarter of this year. We participate in the energy markets, whether that\u2019s frac sand or ethanol and those have been pressured. They have been pressured for much as a year, as I called out. And separately, we also are highly integrated with customers who are the integrated steel mills, so that has taken a hit throughout the year. One thing to point out is, we are running against our toughest year-over-year comps of the year. I believe week 20 of last year, so mid-May was our highest volume week of the year. So that\u2019s causing part of the volume decline year-over-year. But we also understand and it\u2019s important to note that our opportunities are within that $800 billion plus truck and logistics market. We have got the most powerful intermodal franchise in the east, and as you know, we are aligned with the best channel partners in the industry. We have got a diverse merchandise network with a great service product. We are staying very close to our customers and we are collaborating with them right now, near-term opportunities as they adjust the supply chain dislocations and on longer term opportunity. So we are confident about where we are headed. Jordan Alliger : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Brandon Oglenski : Hey. Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Alan, I guess, if we could just follow-up there though, I mean, in an environment coming out of post-COVID. Are you talking with your customers right now about what\u2019s going to take for a recovery and get them back up to prior volume levels and does that include changes in service patterns or pricing or I guess what\u2019s the path forward once we get beyond the shutdowns here? Mike Wheeler : Yeah. Brandon, I think, you are going to see some differences in supply chain requirements moving forward. There is going to be potentially more forward positioning. There is going to be more an emphasis on reliability and consistency. And frankly, that benefits Norfolk Southern, because we have got the best intermodal franchise in the East. When the recovery happens, people are going to be focused on capacity, cost, service and ESG and Norfolk Southern offers all of that relative to our primary form of competition, which is truck. So we touch over 50% of the consumption and the manufacturing in the economy. We are staying close to our customers. Even now we are launching innovative service products. So we are pretty confident about where things are headed once the economy re-opens. Brandon Oglenski : Okay. I appreciate that. And then, maybe follow up for Mark or Jim, you guys did say that some of your cost variability is dependent service product expectations. And Jim that was pretty bullish that you are not backing off of the 2021 OR target. So, I guess, are you putting a cost structure in place where you see line of sight to achieving that type of operating ratio at some sort of volume level in the future? Jim Squires : Well, the question is not if, but when we get to a 60 operating ratio. That remains our goal. We are going to get there as quickly as we can. And yes, that will be through a leaner cost structure, with the kinds of cost structural initiatives that we have been through this morning. And so, yes, that\u2019s very much part of the outlook and we believe we will have strong operating leverage when growth resumes, which it will. Brandon Oglenski : All right. Thank you, Jim. Operator : The next question comes from Bascome Majors of Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question. Bascome Majors : Yeah. Thanks for taking my questions. Mark, most of the class ones have pulled their guidance like you did today, but several have continue to provide investors with some sort of framework to think about kind of a worst case, free cash flow scenario in their own stress tests of the business. How should we think about free cash flow for Norfolk this year? Mark George : Thanks, Bascome. So we have modeled a number of different scenarios and we haven\u2019t picked one, because we know whatever one we pick will be wrong. But we have modeled high single-digit declines to mid-upper teen declines on revenue and volumes to \u201820s and \u201830s. And in all those circumstances and cases, you are going to see that we have modeled free positive cash flow contribution, we are going to grow cash flow this year regardless. But one thing we are doing is to preserve cash, you would have noticed, we have really taken a significant chunk out of capital expenditures this year to make sure that we maintain the proper balance and we augment our liquidity and certainly what is going to be an uncertain time, because we don\u2019t know how deep this will go and how long it will last before recovery begins again. So in pretty much all the scenarios we have modeled we are still generating positive cash flow and positive free cash flow and we feel actually very good about our whole liquidity equation as well as you can see from the slide I shared. We have got plenty of plenty of vehicles to go for credit, if we needed, and again, the capital reduction is also very, very meaningful to us as well as frankly, a very strong cash balance opportunity. Bascome Majors : Thank you. Thank you for walking us through that. I am sorry, so on the January call, maybe take that a step further to the structural discussion, you said one of the biggest surprises coming into this industry from the outside was the capital intensity of the business and that was going to be a priority for you to take a hard look at that as the CFO. I mean, so you have been going through these this process of broader structural cost reductions, any update you could have on some opportunities you think where you could kind of change that equation longer term within that? Mark George : Yeah. I mean, I think, you see a little bit of evidence of that here with the capital reduction that we have done very early in the year. You don\u2019t cut $500 million or 25% out of your annual capital spend easily. So we really got together as a team and similar to the whole locomotive discussion, I just went through, we iterated several times on what we could do to reduce capital spend and get to a new baseline level. For which to be honest, we are at -- this is a low level, we haven\u2019t been here since 2010 in absolute dollars. But we felt it was the right thing to do because we sense that there was going to be volume pressure, sure enough, it\u2019s come and it\u2019s, it\u2019s real in front of us, so I am glad we have gone through this exercise. From here though as revenue grows, I would hope that we are able to contain growth in CapEx at a more moderate pace below the pace of revenue growth in the future and maybe grow into a lower percentage of revenue below the 16 to 18 at some point. So that\u2019s one thing that I think the organization is very keen on and then the second frankly is what we talked about with regard to the locomotive rationalization itself. We took a long hard look at the assets and in that particular pool, and frankly, we are going to shift over and now look at other pools of assets we have as well and make sure, one of the perils of group depreciation is that you are not necessarily motivated or incentivized to be looking at the assets once they are on the books. In this case, I think we have to look at that, because they do attract cost. Do we have a lot of buildings out there along the network that maybe we don\u2019t need any more, structures that again attract maintenance cost, they attract electricity costs, they attract property assessments, those are like one area we might look at, we have seen our coal franchise shrinks considerably. Do we have surplus assets in coal that we need to re-examine and re-look at. So we are asking these questions as a team, the team is open-minded about it, and I think, again, you see in the first quarter some evidence of that. Operator : The next question is from Ravi Shanker of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Ravi Shanker : Thanks. I just wanted to follow up on the discussion about the incremental margins when volumes do come back. You have a pretty illustrative cost structure slide on slide 22 of your deck. It\u2019s really helpful, which shows that you have a pretty variable or semi-variable cost structure, which should help you on the way down. But, I mean, how does that not become an impediment to incremental margins on the way back up again, given that we just by very nature if it\u2019s more variable, a lot of those cost need to come back? Jim Squires : Well, we do expect to be able to hold the line on many of the costs within our cost structure, as volumes return and there lies the operating leverage in the model. Now, certainly, we will have some volumetric expense increases with volume on the way up as is the case on the way down. But the key will be to hold the line in terms of additions to the asset and resource base as much as we possibly can. We know we can do that and ride that wave of volume upsurge, which should generate rapid and significant operating ratio improvement and bottomline growth. Ravi Shanker : Okay. And as a follow-up, how would you characterize the competitive environment in the east, I mean, obviously, we know what\u2019s happened in the truck side, but just more with your rail competitor? Mike Wheeler : Yeah. Trucks are very competitive right now. Those are the opportunities for us that is supported by our -- strength of our franchise and those are the service products that we are developing right now is to help our customers and as they deal with changes in their supply chain and we are working on near-term solutions and long-term solutions. I have noted we got wonderful merchandise franchise with broad exposure to the U.S. economy. We have got a great intermodal franchise, the best in the east and we have got an outstanding service product. And just within intermodal, you can go back three years, go back four years, you go back five years and you can see that Norfolk Southern and our customers have paced the growth in the entire industry during that time period. You can go all the way back to recovery from the great recession in 2010. So it\u2019s -- as I have talked about before, we are making decisions in the long-term best interest of our shareholders. That includes our market approach and our willingness to partner with our customers to support their growth over the long-term. Operator : The next question comes from Ken Hoexter of Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Ken Hoexter : Hey. Good morning. And great job in the -- on the cost side and the locomotive move. Mike or Jim, just an interesting move in shutting the yards and some of the other steps you are taking during this volume downturn. Maybe can you talk a bit about what move you could see becoming more permanent, are there some examples that you can talk to. I know you talked a little bit about the blending of the trains, but just want to understand as the business comes back, what are the steps that you are taking, you see, could be a bit more permanent? Mike Wheeler : Yeah. Sure. Thank you. As you have noted, we have been looking at our term loan yards for long-term since a great recession, we have either idled or converted five of our top terminals, we did two of them last year and we are continuing to look at that and those are long-term structural cost reductions and you will see more of that as we go forward. I would also note that we have talked about we have shutdown a lot of our smaller outline yards, brought that traffic in and consolidated it. And as Mark noted, those are assets over time that will go away and take less cost. But we continue to look at it and find out what we can live without and we have got a lot of opportunities out there that we are looking at, more to come and you will hear more about it as we go forward. But yeah, those are things we are looking at and are going to do. Ken Hoexter : Okay. Alan, maybe just, I appreciate your competitive comment before when you were talking about the competitive market. But just looking at coal being down 60% this past week and really taken a beating lately. How do you plan for this, are you looking at the business structurally disappearing, is it something that\u2019s just a mild winter and you expect it to come back as the export and domestic markets come back, maybe just talk about your views on that market a bit? Alan Shaw : Ken, we understand that our utility coal or the nations utility coal franchise is in a secular decline. And so what you see from us is, a response and working with our customers on ways to promote coal dispatch relative to natural gas, but also we are adjusting our franchise as well. You saw that and so with short line activities, you saw that idled of Ashtabula just this quarter you saw in the sale of our Pocahontas Land Corporation assets. Stockpiles in the utility coal franchise right now are incredibly high. They are at about 125 days. Coal burn in March was at a new national record low at 29 million tons. And so, I think, coal is -- our utility coal franchise is going to be pressured for a considerable amount of time. We need to get the economy back running. So industrial and commercial load comes back and we are also going to need to see an overall increase in energy prices, prices in the PJM are in the teens right now for electricity and that is not going to promote coal burn. Operator : The next question is from Chris Wetherbee of Citi. Please proceed with your question. Chris Wetherbee : Hey. Great. Thanks. Good morning. Maybe, Mark, if you could drill in a little bit more specific around some of the CapEx comments, I think when you outlined or when the company outlined the plan, the PSR plan locomotives were kind of decent size chunk of the 16% to 18% CapEx spend over time. I think it seems like some of the actions you guys have taken recently have the potential to really rationalize that, even just obviously this year, but potentially in 2021 and 2022. Is that the right way to think about it or could there be other puts and takes that might drive that number back up into that sort of longer term rate. Just want to make sure I understand that this is sort of a spin that that likely is going to come down relative to maybe what you thought it was a year and a half ago or so? Mark George : Yeah. Thanks for the question, Chris. I am going to tag team this with, Mike. But the reduction in the CapEx is really little bit across the board, not so much on the locomotives, but in other areas, whether it\u2019s IT, a little bit of our maintenance, we have really taken a look at all the various categories and try to bring it down a notch even some of the terminal spends, especially given the volume pressures that we have. So it really went across the board and we know though, like I mentioned earlier, we are going to have pressure to raise from here. But I want, Mike, maybe you can talk a little bit about locomotives and cat 1 versus cat 1 on the ops stuff. Mike Wheeler : Sure. Yeah. On the locomotive DC to AC conversions, we are committed to that revitalization, because we have got some DC locomotives out there that upgrading to the AC is really cost efficient from a capital standpoint and been really pleased with the reliability from this. So that project will continue on going forward over the next couple of years, it\u2019s the right thing to do and what we did push out, we had taken some opportunistic additional DC to AC conversions that we were looking at this year, we are pushing those out, we are not going to do those. Some rebuild of our yard and local fleet we have pushed out. So the DC to AC conversions will continue at the pace that we have talked about in the past. Relative to the capital expenditures, we are very fortunate that we have got some great technology in our company, particularly on the engineering side. We are making sure that we are putting our rails, ties and ballast in the right locations. We have got technology these days that are they are using machine vision to determine whether ties are good or not. They are even doing X rays internally. So we are making sure that when we put ties in, we will put them in the right place at the right time, same thing with rail where we are using predictive analytics to determine where the rail needs to be replaced at and that\u2019s allowing us to really pinpoint our asset replacements. And we are really comfortable with the fact that we are doing the right thing for maintaining this railroad in a long-term, both on the locomotive reliability front, as well as the track infrastructure. Chris Wetherbee : Got it. Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. I appreciate the color. And then maybe a quick follow-up, Alan, would you think about the truckload market. I think there is a building sense that coming through this downturn when volume comes back, we could be coming into a somewhat tighter truckload market than what we sort of exited. So can you talk about sort of how that kind of plays into the strategy on the intermodal side and what the opportunities might be there for you? Alan Shaw : Yeah. Chris, it\u2019s that\u2019s very similar to what you saw in 2009 and 2010, isn\u2019t it, where you saw some pretty considerable supply reactions on the truckload side to a steep downturn and spot prices. And so for us it means continuing to collaborate with our best-in-class supply chain partners, our channel partners on how we give them an exceptional service product, how we look for new opportunities, new lanes for them to grow into and then it\u2019s also selling the things that are going to be pretty darn valuable post-COVID-19, which is capacity, a lower cost structure than truck, its service and its ESG and we have got the best intermodal franchise in the east. So we are in great shape there. Chris Wetherbee : Got it. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it. Operator : The next question is from Justin Long of Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Justin Long : Thanks and good morning. Maybe to follow-up on that last question, regarding domestic intermodal, obviously, one thing that\u2019s changed is the fall off in fuel prices. So I was wondering if you could comment on the gap in pricing between contractual intermodal pricing and contractual truckload pricing in your network today. And as you think about domestic intermodal going forward, do you feel that it is still a GDP plus growth business, whenever things recover even if fuel prices hang out around the current levels? Mike Wheeler : Hey, Justin. The gap has certainly closed. The real pressure is coming from that spot truck market. And at some point, as the economy starts to improve and as there are supply of ramifications throughout the truckload market, that\u2019s going to particularly affect the spot market. So it\u2019s important for us to maintain that vision as we are approaching the market and not chase the spot truck. You have heard me talk about that before. That\u2019s not within the long-term best interests of our corporation. So we are focused on what we can deliver and that is a great service product, a great, intermodal franchise that has allowed our customers to outpace the industry and growth over any number of years. Justin Long : Okay. And maybe looking bigger picture at the volume performance of the business, obviously, it\u2019s weak across the Board right now, but there is a pretty substantial difference in the year-to-date volumes at in as procedure eastern competitor. I am curious if you could just comment on that gap, if there have been any major market share losses this year that are driving that is, it\u2019s a function of mix? And as you look at that gap, how should we be thinking about the actions you are taking to close that gap and the timing around that going forward? Thank you. Mike Wheeler : So, Justin, it\u2019s one of the things that I had talked about is, the utility coal franchise, which is last year was 60% of our volume utility -- of our coal volume in the first quarter is down 44%. So that\u2019s having an impact on us. The ethanol markets whether that\u2019s inbound, feedstocks such as corn or outbound ethanol is having an impact on us. Frac sand, we have talked about the energy impact integrated steel mills is having an impact on our franchise. And frankly, the spot trucking market is having an impact on intermodal and we saw an impact on international intermodal in Asia business in February and so all of that contributes to tougher year-over-year comps, as I noted. We are still riding or comparing against pretty elevated volumes of last year. We will get through that in week 20, in which our volumes were at the highest level of last year. And just overall, we understand the markets and we are pretty confident in our knowledge of the markets and we are very confident in our ability to price, to the value of our product and the value of our franchise and make the best long-term decisions for our shareholders and you see that an RPU and revenue per revenue ton-mile trends not just this quarter but over the last three plus years. Justin Long : Okay. Thanks. I appreciate the time. Operator : The next question is from Jon Chappell of Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Jon Chappell : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. My first question for you, it\u2019s been a lot of time on the CapEx changes. Any comment on capital returns, should we assume that given bit more of a disciplined manner in CapEx that you keep pressing the pause button on the buyback program and give us a little bit more clarity on coming out of this? Mark George : Yeah. Thank you, John. Certainly, we were -- we continued full steam in Q1 on the share repurchase activity. Now, obviously, as we do see the markets are contracting significantly, we are going to take a more conservative approach to looking at share repurchase, while maintaining flexibility for when depending on the depth of decline but also the pace of recovery. So, I think, we will certainly take a more muted approach here. Jon Chappell : Okay. Thank you. And then, follow-up from Michael really quickly, you guys talked about the locomotive plan and a lot of the service metrics that have been taken. But -- and you look at the PSR implementation from say May 1st relative to where you were sitting on February 1st. What are some of the other adaptations you have made to the plan for 2020 given the precipitous fall on volume? Mike Wheeler : Well, I think, the thing that it is beneficial for us is that, that we are able to adapt quickly, right? As volumes come out, we have been able to take the -- take the -- our crew starts out, you saw that in my slide, I will note that in April so far, we have pretty much matched the volume decline against with the crew start decline that\u2019s around 30%, so which matched it pretty well. So the thing that we have come out of this with is a really nimble organization that can adapt quickly to volume changes. Well, that\u2019s on the downside, like, we have shown or on the upside when it occurs and we are going to get a lot of leverage when that happens because of it. Jon Chappell : Thank you, Michael. Thanks, Mark. Mike Wheeler : Thank you. Operator : The last question comes from Thomas Wadewitz of UBS. Please proceed with your question. Thomas Wadewitz : Yeah. Good morning. I wanted to follow up a little bit on train starts and leverage, maybe if I can refer Mike to your slide, I think, it\u2019s slide 11. So, you are improving on all the metric that gets the weight expansion or probably moving with train length has been more muted, obviously, a function of tough volume backdrop. So how do you think about coming out the other side what the ratio might be or how rapidly you might need to bring back train starts or is there a period of a couple of quarters where you just really see that metric expand a lot and you don\u2019t have to add train starts back used to run longer trains? Alan Shaw : It really will depend on and where the traffic comes back and what type of traffic it is, obviously, if it\u2019s full both you are going to get more of an incremental train starts. But if it\u2019s just across the Board, we have got capacity still in our train lengths to add train lengths before we have to do a lot of train starts. We have got capacity in the terminals as well with both the road crews, the local service crews and the yard crews to handle the capacity. So, we have got a while before we have to make train start deduct or increases. So we are still going to continue to get the upside leverage as this things pulls up, it\u2019s in a great place. Thomas Wadewitz : But you think there could be we win volumes, I mean, obviously, just looking out to the other side, but you think you could actually run without adding trains for a while, where you see positive volumes? Alan Shaw : Correct. Yes. We know where the traffic comes from and that\u2019s our plan. That\u2019s our plan. That\u2019s our goal and that\u2019s the ability of this organization to do that. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Jim Squires for closing comments. Jim Squires : Thank you for your questions this morning. We look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Stay safe everyone. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.  It is now my pleasure to introduce Pete Sharbel, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Sharbel. You may now begin. Pete Sharbel : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Please note that during today's call, we may make certain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and may differ materially from actual results. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. Our presentation slides are available at norfolksouthern.com in the Investors section along with our non-GAAP reconciliation. Additionally, a transcript and downloads will be posted after the call. It is now my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's Chairman, President and CEO, Jim Squires. Jim Squires : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Norfolk Southern's second quarter 2020 earnings call. Joining me today are Alan Shaw, Chief Marketing Officer; Mark George, Chief Financial Officer; and Mike Wheeler, Chief Operating Officer. As we announced earlier this week, Mike will retire from Norfolk Southern on October 1, after a 35-year career of distinguished achievement. He will be greatly missed, and we wish him well. When we began the search for our next Chief Operating Officer, we looked for an experienced executive who could lead our day-to-day operations and build on our successful implementation of precision scheduled railroading. We are proud to welcome Cindy Sanborn, one of our industry's leading operations experts, to the Norfolk Southern team. We look forward to Cindy joining the company on September 1. With that, let's proceed to a review of our second quarter performance. Amid the global pandemic and ensuing economic disruption in the markets and communities we serve, the men and women of Norfolk Southern demonstrated their resilience in the second quarter. Our customers in virtually every segment shipped significantly lower volumes, with many changing their shipping patterns as they work to keep the supply lines open. The automotive industry was particularly volatile, experiencing a rapid and almost total shutdown and then a subsequent restart and push to restock inventory, all within the same quarter. Norfolk Southern's business reflected that disruption. Revenues decreased 29%, leading to a decline of 43% in earnings per share. Our team rose to the challenge. We quickly adjusted network plans and resources in the short-term, while advancing our long-term strategy to deliver shareholder value with several important achievements. First, Norfolk Southern employees are serving our customers and our country with excellence during a pandemic. The successful implementation of our TOP21 strategic plan and precision scheduled railroading, combined with the hard work and commitment of our employees, is producing results. We achieved record train performance, train speed, terminal dwell and shipment consistency. Many other service metrics were near all-time best levels. Second, we managed our operations efficiently as shipped volumes bottomed out while ensuring we have strong operating leverage as business recovers. Year-over-year in the second quarter, our force levels declined by 20%, that's nearly 5,000 positions while train size increased and fuel efficiency improved. These achievements enabled an operating expense reduction of 21% against a 26% decline in volume. We are a fast-fluid railroad ready to take advantage when volumes return. Third, and perhaps most important, we kept our eye on our strategic objectives by attacking structural costs. We reduced our hump yard footprint in the quarter by idling two additional humps, bringing the total to four that have been idled over the past year. These actions create direct cost savings over the coming quarters and demonstrate our success improving our TOP21 train plan to be nimble and adaptive to changing freight demand with fewer, more efficient major terminals. Throughout all of this, we are taking comprehensive steps to protect the health and well-being of our people. All employees who can work remotely continue to do so. For employees whose responsibilities require them to work on site, we are following CDC guidelines. I opened by lauding our team's resilience. While each one of these actions and achievements on its own has merit, when taken together and in the face of the unique disruptions of the second quarter, they demonstrate the determination of this team to forge ahead and take on any challenges necessary to create value for our shareholders. I'll now turn the call over to Alan and the team, to provide further details and commentary. Alan? Alan Shaw : Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Second quarter volume was greatly influenced by the dual shocks of COVID-19 and large declines in our energy markets. We remain committed to executing our strategic plan of long-term revenue and margin growth based on our excellent service product and market approach, both valued by our customers. Our productivity, service and collaborative focus was most evident in our automotive franchise, where weekly volumes declined over 90% early in the quarter. We quickly pulled down our automotive train service and as automotive production resumed rapidly ramped up operations to effectively and efficiently serve our customers. Our dynamic planning process and proactive collaboration with our customers produced this rapid restructuring of plan and assets. Our team remains committed to both maximizing profitable growth and improving our service offering as we emerge from the challenge of the pandemic. Moving to slide 6, second quarter revenue declined 29% year-over-year. These declines were affected by volume impacts of COVID and low energy prices, the latter of which also impacted fuel surcharge revenue. The first half of the quarter had dramatically different results than the second, in which we saw an 8% sequential improvement in volume as the economy started to reopen. Our continued focus on yield is evident with all three business groups improving revenue per unit, excluding fuel, a year-over-year gain we have delivered for 10 consecutive quarters. Decline in fuel surcharge revenue and a changing business mix composed of a greater percentage of intermodal volume, lowered overall revenue per unit. Merchandise volume declines were most pronounced in the automotive franchise as automotive volumes declined more than 60% quarterly for mid-April and May production stoppages throughout the industry. Decreases in this market rippled to adjacent products such as steel and plastics. Nearly every market was hurt by pandemic shutdowns, energy prices, consumption decreases or a combination of these items. Food products were greatly influenced by closed restaurants and other points of sale. Low energy prices drove declines in all of our energy markets, including utility coal, frac sand, crude oil, natural gas products and scrubber stone. Intermodal revenue fell 19% in the second quarter, driven by lower levels of consumer demand in response to the pandemic. As the economy reopened, intermodal volume improved as demand for our services grew and truck rates increased. Domestic volumes rebounded as the quarter progressed due to the need to quickly rebuild inventory, while international remained pressured. The increased use of e-commerce and essential goods led to more transloads and domestic equipment. Our coal franchise continued to face pressure this quarter, with revenue declining 55% year-over-year, a result of sustained low energy prices and the global pandemic. Utility volumes declined 57% as load in the industrial and commercial markets deteriorated and coal generation faced intense competition from low natural gas prices. The overall coal decline was slightly offset with an RPU gain of 3%, reflecting volume shortfalls and changing mix. Moving to our outlook on slide 7. We believe the recent volume growth trajectory will moderate with future gains at a slow and uneven pace from June levels. A high degree of uncertainty exists. State and local government reaction to increased COVID cases will have a major influence on the speed and shape of the economic recovery. The growing number of such cases and fiscal policy will impact our outlook to the extent that both influence the strength of consumer demand and labor availability, with the latter having an effect on production. The consumer is active with high retail sales figures reported for June and durable goods spending close to pre-pandemic levels, increasing the need for transportation services. In the trucking sector, spot rates have returned to pre-COVID levels and are currently at the highest point of the year during this inventory replenishment cycle, a positive near-term signal for intermodal and truck competitive merchandise markets. These markets rely heavily on the consumer where the impact of government stimulus, potential shutdowns and unemployment will be key drivers in the continued recovery. Intermodal will benefit from new product development, such as the recently announced numerous services that strengthen the link with our best-in-class channel partners, enhance our interline service offerings and allow Norfolk Southern to secure even more business moving from the Southeast to the Northeast. These products create value for our customers, while utilizing the capacity dividend, generated by our efficient and faster network. Although the manufacturing economy is lagging the consumer, we are seeing a solid rebound in automotive, where volumes quickly started improving at the end of May with continued strength through the third quarter as inventories rebuild. We expect energy to remain depressed. Continued low natural gas prices and unfavorable crude oil spreads are creating additional headwinds across all of our energy markets. Export coal is expected to continue to be negatively impacted by the worldwide pandemic and geopolitical tensions. Our expectations are tempered with the ever-present uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 and fiscal policy. This quarter was marked with a sharp difference between the first six weeks and the last. We understand that our volumes will fluctuate as our customers and their customers are impacted by potential future state and local restrictions, in response to increasing COVID infections. Despite these conditions, our strategy is clear. We will continue to improve our revenue quality and service product, delivering services that allow our customers to compete and succeed, while utilizing fewer resources. I will now turn it over to Mike, for an update on operations. Mike Wheeler : Thank you, Alan. And thank you, Jim, for those kind words. The second quarter saw an unprecedented amount of operating change, as we ceased hump operations at two yards and responded to major volume shifts with a keen eye, towards making many of our crew start reductions permanent. We continued to execute at a high level, while pressing forward with our transformation and managing through the challenges of the pandemic. Moving on to slide 9, which again shows continued improvements in train speed and terminal dwell, setting or tying all-time records for us this quarter. Our operation benefited from the network fluidity that came with dramatically lower volumes. We were able to adjust our operation, in line with our customers, again, setting records in train performance, shipment consistency and plan adherence. These milestones came as we further reduced assets and employment, while taking advantage of the lower volume environment to reconfigure, our network operations. Moving on, slide 10 is the update to our service and productivity metrics for the year, which you have seen in previous quarters. All of our metrics are showing improvement on a year-to-date basis, reflecting both our continued progress and the effect of the pandemic. Our service delivery index measures shipment on-time performance, indexed to 2018. We were already at our 2021 goal in the first quarter. And continue to improve in the second quarter, which will enable us to meet or exceed our goals over the rest of the year. We continue to provide a service product that meets or exceeds our customers' expectations. Extreme volume swings challenged both T&E and locomotive productivity, during the quarter. We reduced both T&E employment and active locomotives during the quarter to the lowest numbers on record, but those changes slightly lag the reduction in volumes. We improved our year-over-year train way, by closely matching the train plan to volume changes. And being careful about, when and where we added additional service as business returned. Train length grew even more than train weight. Matching the plan to volumes helped us realize an increase in fuel efficiency, to a second quarter record, by maximizing the returns on the investment in energy management and PTC technology. Finally, we easily surpassed our Cars Online goal, setting new records in the quarter that were driven down in part, directly by lower volumes and in part, by our record train speed and dwell metrics that kept cars moving towards destination. As in past quarters, this includes cars that were both active and stored awaiting upturns in business. Moving on to slide 11, this is our sixth consecutive quarter of accelerated crew start reductions. I am exceptionally proud that our operating team was able to respond so quickly to the sudden and severe pandemic-induced volume drops. We will continue to use both tactical and structural changes to keep our cost structure controlled and flexible as volume changes. Prior to the pandemic, we advanced through Phase 3 of the TOP21 program. We are continuing to optimize our train network and rationalize our yard network, even while setting the stage for positive operating leverage as volumes rise. Implementing TOP21 enabled us to cease hump operations at Linwood and Bellevue. Continued progress comes through long-term structural changes in our asset base, improved service levels and rising productivity metrics following proven PSR principles. Moving to slide 12, we seized the opportunity to use the second quarter business drop to craft a better plan for when traffic returned. As this graph shows, we reduced crew starts in line with business reductions. But as traffic comes back, we are fully optimizing our train capacity based on our current business mix instead of simply just restoring previous train starts. Slide 13 shows how Well Norfolk Southern is positioned. In the second quarter, we closed one of our two locomotive heavy repair shops and ceased hump operations at two of our large yards, Linwood and Bellevue, making a total of four hump yards eliminated in a year's time. Our structural network changes are emblematic of our willingness to transform the way we operate in the pursuit of efficiency. We aggressively continue to look for additional opportunities to reduce our terminal footprint. We can and will do more to reduce our resource and investment needs. But we are also capitalizing on the return of traffic from historic lows by adding back trains more slowly than returning traffic. As traffic does come back, we are much more willing to mix traffic types on whatever trains have capacity and can meet service standards. Generating this kind of operating leverage during a rise in traffic is very powerful, and we are committed to maintaining that leverage. Now I will turn it over to Mark who will cover the financial results. Mark George : Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone. On slide 15, you see the key financial measures. As Alan shared, while RPUX fuel for each commodity was favorable, adverse mix and declining fuel surcharge revenue created headwinds leading to overall revenue being down 29% on volume being down 26%. Operating expenses were down 21% in the quarter, with each cost component driven lower, led by fuel as well as employment-related costs. As we signaled in May, we weren't able to completely mitigate the sudden and dramatic volume declines with dollar-for-dollar expense reductions. And this led to operating income being down $455 million while the operating ratio increased 710 basis points. Despite the 43% decline in operating income, free cash flow for the quarter declined by half that rate or 22%. So it remained more durable and contributed to a record free cash flow during the first half of the year of over $1 billion. On slide 16, you will see that the quarter was free of any significant unusual items, although, the EPS compare versus last year does benefit from the absence, of a non-operating impairment charge that was recorded in Q2 2019. So while the reported EPS eroded by $1.17, the contraction from core operations is actually $1.25. Moving to Slide 17 and operating expenses, you will see they were driven down by $385 million or 21%. Certainly, fuel savings were a large contributor with roughly half of that savings driven by the sharply lower prices. $74 million of the reduction was from lower consumption due to the decline in GTMs. But also another solid quarter of fuel efficiency gains, which was 3% this quarter and is now 4% year-to-date. We drove Comp & Ben down $126 million or 18% as employment was reduced by nearly 20% or 5,000 year-over-year and down 5% versus 1Q. It's important to note that, as we pressed forward with structural resource reductions in the quarter. We did maintain forces on extra board status that would be required to serve in the event of a sudden surge in volume, which is exactly what happened, in June, where volume sequentially increased 12% from the May level with no adverse service disruption. As Mike touched upon, we prioritized this approach as complementary to our strategic plans focus on best-in-class service without the cyclical variability in reliability that has plagued the industry historically. You'll note $20 million in savings from managing tightly our overtime as well as re-crews which were down 50%. In line with what I had signalled during the quarter, Comp & Ben per employee was sequentially down by a modest amount. Moving over to Purchase Services & Rents, this was down 11%, with Purchase Services itself down 13%, driven by lower intermodal and automotive facility costs associated with the volume decline. Material costs are down $20 million, thanks in large part to reduced maintenance costs associated with our mechanical realignment as well as initiatives surrounding a locomotive and railcar fleet rationalization, the lower other costs of $11 million benefits from our constraint of travel and other discretionary items. Gains from the sales of operating properties this quarter was negligible, similar to last year. You'll recall last quarter. I provided a window into, how you should think about these expense categories, from a volume variability perspective given the on-set of what we knew would be a volume shock here in Q2. I indicated that we would be able to reduce roughly 50% to 60% of our costs, with volume. In Q2, the 21% reduction in costs or 16%, if you exclude the anomalous fuel price benefit, was exactly in line with that 50% to 60% guidance, I had given. On slide 18, we look at the full P&L and here, you'll see that other income net of $49 million is $27 million better than prior year. This favorability is driven by the absence of last year's $28 million asset impairment charge, along with a $25 million year-over-year increase in COLI returns. This favorable return was partially offset by headwinds from lower non-operating property gains, as well as transaction costs associated with the debt exchange that we completed during the quarter. Lastly, the modestly lower effective tax rate in the quarter of 22.1% was driven by the COLI returns I just mentioned, which are not subject to income tax. Moving to slide 19. For the six months ended June 2020, our free cash flow was a record at $1.23 billion, aided in large part by fewer capital additions and timing of income tax payments. Property additions in the first half were $735 million, $244 million below 2019 levels, and we're on a run rate to be at our target of $1.5 billion for the year, which will be a 25% reduction from 2019 spend levels. With our cash generation and liquidity profile, we were able to continue to distribute cash to shareholders, maintaining our dividend, while moderating share repurchase activity. In the quarter, we repurchased 1.3 million shares, roughly $200 million. As of now, we have over $1 billion of cash on hand, with less than $100 million of debt maturities in the next year. So we are in a comfortable place in case the recent market stabilization that we are enjoying falters. I'll just wrap with a comment on the outlook. While we can't be certain of the volume shape in the back half, as you heard from Mike, we are taking this opportunity to make significant structural changes to our network, while also driving further efficiencies into the train plan. These actions ensure that we are well positioned to leverage the volume recovery. And that in any scenario, we are moving forward with transforming our cost structure. Jim? Jim Squires : Thank you, Mark. In summary, we are committed to driving our operating ratio down and still have a goal of 60. We have a full-court press on productivity initiatives to ensure that our cost structure improves while also capitalizing on the operating leverage that we are achieving. Thank you for your attention, and we'll now open the line for Q&A. Operator? Question-and-Answer Session Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Q - Chris Wetherbee : Yeah. Hey, thanks and good morning guys. Jim, I just want to pick up where you left off. So you mentioned the goal 60 from an OR perspective. And, obviously, there are some structural changes that you made during the quarter. Some of those might have been pulled forward from future plans because of the pandemic. But when you think about sort of the hump yard opportunities and some of the other structural network changes that you've made, how do you sort of see that potentially impacting that longer-term 60 goal? Is there an opportunity beyond 60? Can you just put some numbers around it? Jim Squires : Good morning, Chris. Good question and really shines a light on what is our main focus right now, which is to continue driving productivity and efficiency gains in the current economic environment. And we took action in that regard in the second quarter through the conversion of one hump yard and the closure of another. We also took off-line 1 of 2 major back shop locomotive maintenance facilities. So we demonstrated our commitment to driving productivity in the midst of the volume challenges in the second quarter, and we will continue to push hard on that as we move through the rest of the year and beyond. Mike, let me turn it over to you for some additional comments. Mike Wheeler : Yes. Well, we're not letting off the gas. We've got several things we continue to look at that are in the hopper, and we'll roll out as appropriate based on the volumes in the business. But like I've said before, we are going to continue to push ourselves to find ways to reduce our structural costs out there and the terminals that we can do without, while still providing service product that we've committed to. So we still have things we're working on and you'll see those roll out in the future. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate that. And then maybe, Alan, one for you on the yield-up strategy, obviously, you put up, I think, 10 consecutive quarters of yield growth, RPU growth, less fuel. When you think about the potential for an improving truckload cycle, so our rate environment getting better potentially next year. How quickly does that translate down into the business, say, into the Merchandise or Intermodal business? Can you capitalize on that in the back half of the year? Is it something we need to see potentially rolling out into 2021? Can you just give us some comments on that? Alan Shaw : Yes, Chris, it depends upon how quickly moves up and whether those spot rates that we're seeing right now translate into contract rates. But yes, we generally touch 50%, 55% of our revenue every year. And we've got a great service product, and we've got confidence in the quality of that product and we're pricing accordingly. Chris Wetherbee : Okay, appreciate the time. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Thomas Wadewitz with UBS. Thomas Wadewitz : So maybe I can start off with one for you, Jim, just in terms of the Chief Operating Officer transition, so Mike, congratulations on the retirement and all the progress on PSR and TOP21. Mike Wheeler : Thank you. Thomas Wadewitz : Jim, how did you think about the search process? And given the success with TOP21, the decision to go external as opposed to going internal? Jim Squires : Sure, Tom. Well, I too wanted to thank Mike again for his many contributions over the years and we deeply appreciate your service, Mike. Let me describe briefly the process that the Board of Directors went through in selecting Cindy, as our next Chief Operating Officer. It was a comprehensive search process. It began by defining the experiences and qualities we were looking for as a Board of Directors in our next COO. And these were things like demonstrated experience with operations at a very high level, at a leadership level, a commitment to safety in operations as paramount, qualities like success in working with regulators and other stakeholders, a commitment to service, great service for our customers. And \u2013 so we began with a large field of candidates. We steadily narrowed it down, and we ended up with Cindy and she brings to us all of the qualities and experiences that I just outlined. And in addition, she brings experience with the PSR model specifically, having worked at both Union Pacific and CSX, which, like NS, are in the midst of implementing PSR. So we're delighted to welcome her to our team starting September 1. Thomas Wadewitz : Okay. Great. And then for the follow-up question, just wanted to see if you could offer some broader thoughts on how we think about the move over the next year or plus or minus, the move in the operating ratio. Is this primarily a volume-driven operating leverage type of framework? Is that the way we should look at it in terms of really focusing on volume, or is there really a lot to go still on the kind of pure cost, productivity, TOP21 framework? I'm sure it's a mix of both, but I'm just trying to get a sense of which would be more important looking forward or looking to 2021? Thank you. Jim Squires : Let me start by acknowledging that the operating ratio in the second quarter is not where we need it to be and not where the operating ratio will be going forward, we believe. It was a tough quarter, particularly the first part of it, with revenue down as much as it was, particularly in key areas. So we struggled in the first couple of months in the quarter. Now things began to turn around in June and we saw the volume pick up. And naturally, we saw the operating leverage kick in, in the month of June, and that has continued thus far in July as well. Who knows what the rest of the year may hold. As you heard from Alan, it's a mixed outlook. We're feeling pretty bullish about the current volume levels relative to where they were in the second quarter, but we'll see. Looking out, if the question is whether growth counts, whether growth matters for further operating ratio improvement, absolutely, it helps. And it would be a significant tailwind. If the question is whether our strategy for OR improvement is dependent on growth, the answer is no. We intend to drive the operating ratio lower and to get to our 60 goal under whatever conditions we experience. We believe we have a strategy that is adaptable enough and we have enough opportunities in other areas while pursuing strategies that we believe will grow the top line as well. Thomas Wadewitz : Great. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Q \u2013 Amit Mehrotra : Thanks, operator. Hi, everybody. Just a quick question. Jim, do you think OR can be flat to down this year? I mean, it seems like the 71 OR this quarter is really a reflection of unprecedented volume decline. And to be fair, but the cost performance was actually pretty good, but there's just a certain point where you can't react to a 30% decline in revenue from an OR perspective, which is an output. But obviously, there's a lot of revenue \u2013 incremental revenue coming in, in the third and fourth quarter relative to the second quarter that could drive this step function improvement in OR given the costs that you've done. So I'm just trying to understand, can you hold the line on OR on a year-over-year basis this year, even despite the volume challenges you had in the first half, given that it's getting a lot better in the second half so far? Jim Squires : If the comparison is to the volume trough, what we hope will prove to be the trough in April and May, then yes, we have seen a significant impact and is uptick. And as I said, that has translated into operating leverage in the latter part of the second quarter and in the third quarter. And we would expect that to continue given current volume levels, and the productivity measures we've undertaken. But there's so much uncertainty in the macro outlook. Not only for the remainder of this year, but going forward as well. And let me turn it over to Alan. He made a few comments and prepared remarks on this. But Alan, why don't you talk a little bit about our macro outlook for the rest of this year and into next year. A \u2013 Alan Shaw : As Jim noted, we're pretty optimistic about the third quarter. You saw a pretty strong sequential improvement in June over our trough in April and May. Volumes are increasing again sequentially in July, which kind of goes against normal seasonality, where you typically have a little bit of a downturn in July. Yeah. So we see retail activity was up 7.5% in June. We saw durable goods orders were up 7.3%. Housing starts were up 17.3%. Spot rates are up in the upper teens. And truck tonnage increased at the fastest pace in 8.5 years. The auto restart has certainly helped and that's reverberated through the supply chain. So as we talk to our customers, there's a lot of near-term demand. The risks that we see going forward are increasing cases of COVID and the unsettled situation with fiscal policy and the stimulus and the impact that that could potentially have on fourth quarter volume and revenue. Q \u2013 Amit Mehrotra : Right. So if I'm hearing you guys correctly, nobody knows the future, but if the current trends hold, you think you can keep OR flat to even better on a year-over-year basis this year. Is that \u2013 am I reading that correctly? Jim Squires : We're not willing to give guidance on OR, just given the overall uncertainty. We will continue to push hard on cost. And we have measures in the pipeline, and we demonstrated our commitment to cost control in the second quarter as well. We'll keep doing that. Q \u2013 Amit Mehrotra : Okay. Jim Squires : It's just the macroeconomic. The macroeconomic outlook is so uncertain right now. Q \u2013 Amit Mehrotra : Fair enough. And then, Mark, just a follow-up. The CapEx year-to-date is running lower than the 16% to 18% of sales, which is actually making free cash conversion look pretty good. I'm wondering if there's a potential to see CapEx come down relative to that guidance. You've talked about it in the past, but I'm just wondering if there's any more update you can give there, because the company's free cash conversion is lagging most of the peers that's obviously going to weigh on the multiple of the company, the valuation of the company. I'm just wondering if there's any opportunity to bring down the CapEx to actually improve the free cash conversion. Mark George : Yes. Thanks for the question, Amit. We didn't guide to really to 16% to 18% after the last call. We actually just gave a fixed guidance number on CapEx, where we brought it down to $1.5 billion. And really, the first half number that is our run rate. So we are going to finish the year at/or about $1.5 billion regardless of revenue. So I think hopefully, it means that as a percentage, it could actually be lower than the 16% to 18% range. So we started early in the year in February, and said it's time to bring it down, and we took $0.5 billion out. We will have taken $0.5 billion out of our CapEx budget this year compared to last year. And yeah, definitely, that is what's driving that good conversion you point out in the first half. So the CapEx in the back half is going to continue at that rate. So that should help. But also, Amit, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, some of the conversion benefit that we did enjoy in the first half was a function of tax -- income tax payments that really, in large part, thanks to the Cares Act were pushed into July. So some of that will be made up, unfortunately, in the second half, we won't have the same tax benefit. And then we also had some working capital benefits in the first half. When volumes come down, you don't have as much AR building up. So that will probably unwind as volumes recover in the second half as well. But fully aware that from a cash conversion perspective, our goal is to try to raise that number from where it's been historically. And CapEx is one of the vehicles to get there. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Q \u2013 Jordan Alliger : Yes. Hi. A question on intermodal. You had noted the truckload market tightening. I'm just -- of course, that's good for the longer-term intermodal. I'm just sort of curious, are you actually seeing increased activity or dialogue with customers or perhaps even truck conversions now with regards to intermodal as the truckload market tightens? Thanks. Jim Squires : Alan? Alan Shaw : Hey, Jordan, absolutely. And you can see that reflected in our numbers. Intermodal is actually leading our growth right now as is Automotive. Basically, the consumer segments are doing really well. And we've got a powerful intermodal franchise. We've got a lot of channel partners and beneficial cargo owners out there who want to continue to align themselves with us. And so we've got -- we're delivering a wonderful service product, and it gives us the strength and the confidence to initiate some of these new service products. We've got a couple of new products that we're going to be launching in the third quarter between the Southwest and the Southeast, which are the two fastest-growing regions of the country, and also some product from the Southeast to the Northeast, which has already started. There is absolutely demand for intermodal in this market. And the truck market in certain regions of the country is extremely tight. And Norfolk Southern has got the solution for that. Q \u2013 Jordan Alliger : Great. And then just a follow-up. I know you mentioned -- you guys mentioned on the call, not bringing back crew starts, one-for-one with volume, et cetera. Is there a way you could give some thoughts on headcount as we move sequentially from here based on where it ended in the second quarter? I mean, is there a way to sort of think about the pace of that coming back? Jim Squires : Mike, why don't you comment on the trend in crew starts and then ripple through to employment specifically. And then, Mark, maybe you can take the question on overall head count going forward. Mike Wheeler : Yes. As you noticed in the slides, we continue to leverage crew starts versus volume. And the good news is that's continued in through July. Through July, our crew starts are down 20%, while our volumes only down 10%. So we expect to see that leverage going forward, and we've got a great nimble group to be able to iterate the train plan as necessary and get the leverage on the volume. So really pleased about that, again, 20% down in crew starts, July already, while volume is only down 10%. So we continue to see that and will in the future. Mark? Mark George : Yes. And just to remind, I mean, we've gone down 5,000 employees versus Q2 of last year, that's a 20% reduction. We're kind of lapping now the big step change from the TOP21 implementation. But obviously, we're still chasing a Q2 volume decline that was pretty significant. So, we are focused on trying to rebuild that productivity curve. And as Mike said, hopefully, with any volume growth that comes here in the back half, we can absorb it with what we have, but also continue to look for more productivity opportunities. I'm not going to put a fine point or a number on guidance for headcount, but for sure, it's going to be an area that we're focused on leveraging while we enjoy the volume recovery. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Scott Group : Hey thanks. Morning guys. Mark, last quarter, you gave us some good color on costs and said, I don't expect them to be down more than 20%. Any initial thoughts on how to think about the OpEx in the third quarter? And I know there's been a bunch of OR questions and you guys aren't giving guidance, but I don't know if you're willing to share, but maybe it would be helpful if -- do you have a sense on -- can you share what the June operating ratio was? Maybe that will give us a little bit of help. Mark George : Yes. So, pretty much the volume variability that we had guided last quarter, I think, helped informed you on expectations for OpEx and at the end of the day, we came in pretty much in line with what we guided. So, it worked out well. I would hope now, Scott, that as we start to see volume growth, we actually do better than that curve, and we leverage it and get better incrementals. That's the goal and that's the objective that this leadership team is fully aligned on. But really, the big variable is going to be this momentum we saw with the June volume recovery. And what we're enjoying here in July, does it continue on this trajectory or does it stabilize? And that is really -- if it continues, and I'm fully expecting we're going to try to leverage that and get more and greater incrementals than, hopefully, what I showed you. And yes, we had quite a curve -- to your second part of your question, quite a curve within the second quarter. And I'm not going to give you the exact number, but I will tell you, we weren't in the 70s in the month of June. So, that was encouraging to see that we will -- hopefully, now that's behind us. We had a real deep body blow we took in April and May that it's hard to recover from. But June, we started to be encouraged by the leverage that we started to see with the 12% sequential improvement in volumes. So, with the cost that we took out, we had a decent quarter -- I'm sorry, a decent month in June with an OR that was back in the 60s. Scott Group : Okay. And then, Alan, any -- can you help us think about the core RPU in the -- going forward? It was still positive in the second quarter, but is that possible in the third quarter, I don't know, year-over-year, sequentially, however you think is the best way to help us out here? Alan Shaw : Yes. Scott, as I noted, there were two factors that primarily drove core RPU in the second quarter. One was volume shortfalls, the other was mix. And you can see that punctuated where utility was down 67%, whereas, export was down 45%. So just there, you get some positive mix. So you feel back even more, Scott. There's mix within these markets as well. So our utility South franchise in the second quarter was about 54% of our volume. Last year, at the time, it was 50%. So there's a positive mix there. Similarly within export, export met, which tends to also be longer haul and a higher RPU, was 74% of our volume in the second quarter comp to 56% in the second quarter of last year. So we had a lot of positive mix factors going for us in the quarter. I'd tell you seaborne coking coal prices continue to fall. In the first quarter, they averaged about $155 per metric ton that cascaded down throughout the second quarter. Right now, they stand at like $110 to $115. And so that will put pressure on prices moving through the third quarter. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Brandon Oglenski : Hey good morning, everyone. And thank you for taking my question. Alan or Jim, I guess can we just balance the comments you guys have made here because, Alan, I think in your prepared remarks you said the recent pace of volume gains could moderate. But then I think as you've answered some questions here, you guys have sounded relatively bullish about volume outcomes. So what is it that you see in the market that gives you the bullish sense now, but just maybe making a moderate\u2026 Jim Squires : Bullish for what? Brandon Oglenski : It's just the idea that maybe we pull back here on recent COVID cases? Alan Shaw : Brandon, there are a couple of factors. Number one, we don't expect to continue a 12% sequential improvement in volume month-over-month as we saw, as we moved from May to June. As Jim noted, April and May were deep troughs for us. And we climbed out of that. We think that July is going to come in 4%, 5% probably above where we were in June. So you already see that pace starting to moderate. As we look forward, we see a lot of demand in our consumer oriented markets, which includes merchandise and intermodal, the pressure continues within energy. And so that will have a governor on sequential improvement as we move through the year, and frankly, as I just noted, with Scott Group. Brandon Oglenski : Okay. Appreciate that. And then Mike, congrats again on retirement. But I guess\u2026 Mike Wheeler : Thank you. Brandon Oglenski : \u2026I think you guys said the TOP21, you've gone through Phase 3 now. Can you just remind us what that phase was? I think it was integrating more line haul train operations, but can you dig deeper there and talk about what incremental changes you can make looking ahead to? Mike Wheeler : Thank you. Yeah, sure. So the whole phases of TOP21 implementation has been about blending more and more traffic into the train network. And we first started out blending a lot of the merchandise into the automotive network. That was a big deal for last year's July 1st TOP21 implementation. A lot of that was done with the automotive multilevel into the merchandise, saw great results from that. Phase 2 and 3 was more along the lines of integrating the intermodal into the operation and then continuing to look at what we could do with a reduced terminal footprint but still continue the integration of traffic into the train network. And then that's kind of where we're at now is we've got to the point where a train is a train and it gives us a lot of opportunities to add business back to the network, give it all sorts of opportunities for train rides and still meet the customer expectations. So we've got a lot of flexibility going forward now that we've blended all of that into the TOP21 network. So really pleased about that. And again, a train is a train. And as volume comes back, it just gets added to the network in a really nice incremental way from a productivity metric. So really excited about that going forward. So we're ready to continue to iterate as necessary with to TOP21 as the business comes back. So pretty excited about it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Ken Hoexter : Great. Mike, congrats and good luck. Jim, maybe I just want to step back on the clarifying your 60%. Is that now long-term, it's not -- I just want to clarify, it's not a next year target. And then I guess I want to dig into this quarter, Mike, a little bit. If you took out 20% of employees, but as you noted, only 1,000 in the quarter with volumes down 26%. So most of the work was done before. Comp is now still 28% of costs, which is not different than it was back in 2017. So as you post an over 70% operating ratio, which is now 700 basis points worse than your peer and 1,300 basis points worse than the company that tried to acquire you. Just I understand the confidence still in TOP21. What's missing? Even as companies were going through it, we saw others able to make improvements in that OR. What is the constraint here in getting the cost out because in times like this sometimes companies are able to pull out and be more aggressive in structurally taking out those costs. So Jim, as you step back, maybe give a view of what needs to be done here. Jim Squires : Sure, Ken. Well, as we said a few minutes ago, it was a challenging quarter, and we are not satisfied with the 70% operating ratio we posted in the second quarter. We fully expect operating ratios to trend down through a combination of the growth that we reasonably expect over time and that we will produce ourselves and the productivity initiatives, the many productivity initiatives we have underway. Our strategy is adaptable, and we will lean one way or the other or into both as necessary given the environment we're in. And we are confident that we will make progress toward a 60% operating ratio. We'll get there as fast as we possibly can. Ken Hoexter : But it's not -- no longer it's a 2021 target, right? It's now back to long-term. Jim Squires : As I said, we'll get there as fast as we possibly can. And we have a lot of initiatives underway to do just that. Ken Hoexter : Okay. And then, Alan, for a follow-up. Your pricing up with the ARPU program, which is yielding great results, are you seeing any increased competitive moves, given your focus on pricing, or is the industry taking the opportunity to move on pricing as well. I want to understand like if others are viewing it as an opportunity to come in and take away business if you're focused more on pricing. And maybe that's why the extreme kind of volume swings? Alan Shaw : Yes, Ken, we have seen increased competitive pressures from truck. There's no doubt. And we went through a truck recession last year. But we remain focused during that time period on the long-term and long-term value creation for our shareholders. And that's why we've got 10 consecutive quarters of RPU ex-fuel growth in all three of our business units. We're focused on revenue, revenue quality and margin improvement. We've got confidence in the strength of our franchise, in our markets, our customers and our service products and the fact that we can provide a long-term platform for growth. And you see that reflected in our activity. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore. Jon Chappell : Thank you and good morning everyone. Alan, the auto snapback in the third quarter has been quite noteworthy, not just in your segments, but even across the industry, double-digit jumps almost every single week since the third quarter started. How much of that from your conversation with your customers is a need to restock aggressively versus maybe how much of it is the network that you guys have to relatively outperform the rest of the industry? Alan Shaw : Jon, that's a very valid point. That's kind of one of the issues that we've highlighted going forward. There is -- there are low inventory levels everywhere. We believe that auto finished vehicle inventories are close to a nine-year low at this point. Just look at retail sales. The May inventory sales ratio in retail was at the lowest point in eight years. And so some of what we're seeing right now is an effort to rebuild inventories. And we saw our Auto customers kind of adjust their normal July shutdown time period in an effort to rebuild inventories. Some of that will get pushed back until later in the year. So again, as we talked about this pace of growth that we've seen over the last 10 weeks, we do not reasonably expect that. But we are encouraged by the strength in the Auto industry. And as a result, we're seeing our Steel customers are out. They're raising their rates, and they're adding capacity back as well. Jon Chappell : Great. That's very helpful. And Alan, if I can keep you for the follow-up too. You mentioned the intermodal service offering a couple of times the new ones in the growth part of the country. Just curious on the initial uptake response so far from the customers. On the one hand, you would think the cost proposition of rail is even more compelling just given the pressure that most industries have right now. On the other hand, given the uncertainty in the market, maybe a little bit reluctant to transition more to the rails. How has the initial response been so far on some of those new offerings? Alan Shaw : It's been very strong. Customers are very interested in the product that Norfolk Southern delivers. And a lot of that has to do with the strength of our franchise. We've got the most robust Intermodal franchise in the East. It is a powerful asset for Norfolk Southern, for our customers and our shareholders. We've made this investment, and it's already in the ground and it's created this network that's unrivaled in the East which is where a majority of the consumption and the manufacturing takes place. And so we grew it, as you saw, by 11% in 2017. We grew it by 18% in 2018. It took a pause last year during the freight recession. We're very confident in the strength of our franchise, our market approach, the service product that we deliver and the fact that it's going to be a unique platform for growth for us in the long-term and near-term. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Allison Landry : Thanks. Good morning. Jim, so you have Cindy starting in about a month or so. Could you talk a little bit about the initiatives that she will tackle first in terms of the network? Any ideas that she may have already brought to the table from her time at UP or CSX maybe that are different or additive to what you're currently doing? And then where does Mike Farrell fit in? Will he report directly to Cindy and continue to roll out PSR? Mark George : Cindy and I are very focused on maintaining the operational momentum that we have demonstrated in 2019 and 2020. So we together, view this as an opportunity to continue to push hard on productivity. As we've said, that's a key part of our strategy. And the measures that we take will be similar to the measures we have taken thus far to work to enhance labor productivity, fuel productivity, asset productivity and on down the line. She and I are both also focused on maintaining a high level of service while we pursue these productivity initiatives. That's critical to our long-term success. That's the basis for our ability to grow the top line in the future. And lastly, I would say that she and the rest of the Board are closely aligned on the central importance of safe operations, and we'll be looking for every possible way to continue to drive safety performance as well. So at a high level, that will be the agenda and the alignment that the two of us have. Allison Landry : Okay. That's really helpful. And then just as my follow-up, is there a way to help us think through or quantify the cost savings or the OR benefit from the network changes that you made? And then more broadly, do you see opportunities for further rationalization, whether that's yards or other facilities or assets and possibly, are you considering any changes to the coal network? Thank you. Alan Shaw : Mike? Mike Wheeler : Yes. Thank you, Allison. Like I noted, yes, we are still going to continue to look at structural opportunities for cost reduction. We're going to find terminals that we can live without and still provide the service that we need. So we're going to push ourselves to do that. I will note, we changed the operation at the two humps this quarter, and that's in addition to the two that we did last year. Jim noted the locomotive shop closure where we've just gone down to one heavy repair shop. We are reducing our production gains here the rest of the year for capital reductions. So we're doing a lot of things to change the structural costs of the network. But that doesn't mean that we're going to stop. Everybody is out there looking every day, turning over every rock to try and continue to find ways to do that. And yes, terminals will be a part of that, just like we've always talked about. We've got more in the hopper, and we'll continue to look at that. But it will all be with an eye toward continuing to provide the service product that we've committed to, like we have. So more in the gas tank and more to come. Mark George : And Allison, this is Mark. I think we've mentioned before, you can probably pencil in $10 million to $15 million for the humps that \u2013 for each of the two humps that we've closed. So to your specific question on quantifying them. That's the number. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Bascome Majors : Yeah. Alan, looking at your coal volumes, specifically in the domestic utility side, and 10 years ago, that was 30 million tons in the second quarter. This year, it's closer to 6 million tons, with quite a bit of that just coming out in the last year. Can you help us understand some of the differences between the structural pressure that you're feeling this year? And what I mean by that is, have you seen any newer accelerated customary retirement, some of the domestic utility side of plants where that's just gone and gone forever in the cyclical -- what I mean by that is just the pressure from natural gas and how power is being dispatched and just lower overall power consumption in the U.S.? Thank you. Alan Shaw : Hey, Bascome, we understand that, that calls in a secular decline. We get that. And so what you've seen us do over time is adjust our coal network. We've idled Ashtabula. We've short lined some property in our coal fields. We have reorganized our operations in conjunction with our customers in the coal fields, into the southern utility market and actually improved service and improved efficiency. So we understand the pressures that we're facing. Natural gas prices in June were at an inflation-adjusted low for the last 30 years. So that's created some headwinds, as we talked about. And I also had talked about before that we fully expected that the economic shutdown would negatively impact load in commercial and industrial markets for our utility customers. So that's where it's headed. Frankly, we've got a diverse merchandise franchise that set a record for revenue last year and a pretty weak freight environment, and we've got the most powerful intermodal franchise in the East. So we are well positioned for where markets are headed. Bascome Majors : Okay. So I mean, looking into next year, it's -- I mean, clearly, these declines are pretty substantial in the coal franchise today. I mean, do you expect that to moderate as at least the inventory withdrawal and the power consumption decline inevitably cyclically adjust, or should we just kind of model zero several years out in the domestic business to be safe? Thank you. Jim Squires : There's going to be 0.5 billion tons of coal produced in the United States this year. We're going to haul our share of it. There will be close to 0.5 billion tons of coal produced in the United States next year. We're going to continue to participate in that market where it drives shareholder value. And we're going to continue to look for opportunities within our strong Merchandise and Intermodal market to compete with truck. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. David Vernon : Hey, good morning. Jim and Alan, this question is for you on the commercial side. If we kind of look past the monthly sequential gains from the COVID volatility and we think about where Norfolk is going to be one year or two years from now, presumably, you're still going to have a little bit of an or disadvantage to your eastern peer. How is that going to affect kind of your ability to get back to a market level of growth, or should we not. Jim Squires : Kind of your ability to get back to a market level of growth, or should we not be thinking that, that cost position relative to CSX is going to impact the growth rates across the business? Mark George : Yes, we're going to continue to focus on revenue and revenue quality. And we performed pretty well there. You can see that in the numbers. We are fully intent on competing with truck. We're going to deliver and we are delivering a best-in-class service product. We're implementing customer-facing technology. We've got a consistent and reliable service product with schedules that our customers value. We also have this no-surprises approach to PSR and which we're collaborating with our customers on changes that we're making to the network. And so they know they're confident that we're going to partner with them and continue to provide them with a platform for growth. We serve a majority of consumption and manufacturing in the United States. We're aligned with over 250 short line partners. We've got a best-in-class industrial development team that is developing a robust pipeline of new opportunities. Near shoring, reshoring and onshoring is only going to assist freight demand in the United States. We serve more North American vehicle production than anybody else and more integrated steel mills than anybody else. We've got a powerful franchise. We're very confident in where we're headed with this thing. We've got it positioned well where the consumer and the transportation markets are headed, and that's in areas in which Norfolk Southern excels. David Vernon : So no sort of direct impact on the rail competitiveness, then it's more about what's happening in the truck market for growth? Mark George : Yes. We are going to continue to focus on the truck market for growth, and you're going to see us continue to be aggressive and kinetic in offering new service products that our customers value. We're aligned with the best channel partners in the intermodal industry. We're in good shape going forward. This is where the long-term markets are headed. David Vernon : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Justin Long from Stephens. Justin Long : Thanks and good morning. Maybe circling back to the operating leverage question and asking it a little bit differently. As you look into the back half, third and fourth quarter, do you think that operating expenses can decline at a rate that's faster than revenue? And then also, Mark, if there's anything unusual in the second half in terms of gains on sale you're expecting or anything else from an operating expense perspective? Mark George : Thank you, Justin. So I'll answer the second one first. We don't anticipate any unusual activity in the second half, significant gains or significant write-offs at this point in time. Otherwise, we would have probably taken them, so nothing at this point. Of course, I do believe in the third quarter of last year, you'll recall there was some account receivable provision that was taken that will impact the compares in the third quarter, but I'm sure you all have that in your models. And the first, truly the trajectory of OpEx will be influenced in part by volume. I mean, if volume steps back down, we will be attacking OpEx even more. If volumes do continue on an upward trajectory, then we're still going to put pressure on certain lines of OpEx to reduce them with structural things, and we're going to try to limit the volume variable type of increases that would typically come. And as we say, we're going to try to leverage the P&L with any growth that might come. That said, there is fuel cost that's creeping back up. I think our average price at the pump in the second quarter was under $1 per gallon. So that will go up in the back half of the year. I think right now, it's already trending in the $1.20 something range. So that will be something that we are fighting against. And since I bring that up, we will have some fuel surcharge probably headwinds in the third quarter because that's on a lag. And that $0.98 range in the second quarter will hit our fuel surcharge in the third quarter because it's a lag item. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Brian Ossenbeck : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Coming back to Intermodal, where you clearly are focusing a lot of time and effort there and see growth down the road. Can you remind us how the clean sheeting programs going on within those intermodal terminals? Is that still pretty well developed, or is that something that you've yet to see much benefit from, especially if you're expecting for this to be one of the primary levers to drive growth across the network as you look out over the next couple of years? Mark George : Brian, we continue our progress in making our intermodal network, both within the terminals and in our train performance more efficient. And as Mike has talked about, we continue to look for opportunities to intermodal trains. And we know that as Intermodal and Merchandise revenues come back, it's going to fold into existing trains. And in the third quarter, we're going to be rolling out an optimized a terminal optimization system across our Intermodal network which is going to offer even further improvements in the service that we provide within our terminals to our customers as well as the efficiency of our terminals. But I also want to make sure that it's really clear. We are focused on growing Merchandise just as much. And we're putting out new products in Merchandise based on this strong and reliable and consistent service product that we've got that's going to allow us to take share from truck as well\u2026 Jim Squires : And the capacity dividend that we have out there on the rail Merchandise side as well. Mark George : That's exactly right. Mike referenced the capacity dividend, Brian. And so that's where we're going to fold new business into existing operations which is going to give us great operating leverage going forward as we continue to grow. Brian Ossenbeck : Okay. Quick follow-up for Mike then. Congrats, again, on the retirement and the recent success with TOP21 and Phase 3. What do you think would be as you look forward what are the biggest challenges you see structurally on the operating side as you look over the next couple of years? And how do you think you would be addressing those? And I guess I'll take away the answer of volume as a big challenge. So maybe volume agnostic, what are some of the bigger challenges? Any opportunities as well in terms of what's left for the network the next couple of years and in the long term? Mike Wheeler : Well, thank you. And the opportunity is the fact that our operation leadership team is completely bought into and aligned with the PSR principles. So they understand them. They know them. And they're implementing them. So they're using that every day to find ways to be more productive, but still provide the good service product. So I think that's the great opportunities. As we've got a great team out there, that every day is looking to turn over the rocks and find what they can do. And then the network planning and optimization group, that we put together that's really helped drive the TOP21 iteration, take the structural costs out. They're in place, continuing to look at long-term, structural cost changes. And these are the terminals that we're talking about. And then, the last thing is, we continue to have technology implementation across the operating division, whether it's in engineering to look at. Where we need to replace ties and rail and making sure, we're doing it the most efficient way and the safest way. How we do train handling. So we have just got so many opportunities out there on the railroad to continue to provide the service product that allows marketing to grow the business, but also folks know how to take out tactical and structural costs, and then utilizing technology that we've put out there across the railroad. And the technology really has driven our fuel efficiency that you've seen over the last couple of quarters. And that will continue to be another opportunity for cost going out the door, because that's nothing. But dollar savings right to the bottom line. And it fits in with the ESG, making us a really good partner there. Brian Ossenbeck : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Walter Spracklin : Hi. Thanks very much. Good afternoon, everyone. I want to go back, Jim, to one of the questions on operating ratio. I understand that looking out to next year in the back half, I should say, is a little difficult given the macro uncertainty. So I wanted to kind of take out that uncertainty and give you a scenario where volume is down or -- the volume rebound continues and year-over-year down just modestly. In that scenario, not guidance, but in that scenario where we have volume down modestly, could you do better in terms of operating ratio than you did last year? Jim Squires : Walter, I think in the current environment of uncertainty, it's very difficult for us to sign up for any scenario, even a hypothetical one. But I would say this we are committed to driving toward a 60% operating ratio, irrespective of the macro environment, in which we find ourselves. And that means that, if we are unable to grow volume and revenue at the pace we would like, we will attempt to make it up, through productivity improvements. And I think we demonstrated that. Yes, the operating ratio in the second quarter was not what we wanted it to be. And not what it needs to be. But in the midst of that, we recommitted to productivity improvements, and we demonstrated that commitment through the actions we took. Walter Spracklin : Okay. As a follow-up, on yields, just regardless of base price, I don't know if you can give me an indication ex-coal, what the mix effect is expected to be in the back half, just kind of should it be additive or negative. I would assume, with automotive and some of the other products that are higher yield coming back, that should be positive, but I just want to make sure. Alan Shaw : Walter, good morning, it will be negative as intermodal is a growth driver for us. So that's negative with respect to yield, certainly, positive with respect to revenue growth. Operator : Our next question is from the line of David Ross with Stifel. David Ross : Yes. Good morning, gentlemen. I just want to circle back on intermodal. Obviously, much better third quarter to date. In the second quarter, international was a lot weaker than the domestic. How would you characterize July so far in the international versus domestic? Alan Shaw : They both have improved quite a bit. What you're seeing is there's not a lot of exports right now. There's heavy demand for imports in the international space. Since inventories are so low, you're seeing a lot of stuff that's hitting the West Coast as opposed to coming all the way around to the East Coast. And so that's creating some transloads into 53-foot containers out on the West Coast, which has opened the domestic demand. But I should say that, we do have several ports that we serve where import demand right now is very high as well. David Ross : And when you talked about the new service offerings, is that fair to say that those are new intermodal lanes or new intermodal corridors? And then the question is, are they, I guess, new to Intermodal as if a shipper did not have that intermodal choice versus truck in those lanes before, or are they just new to Norfolk Southern? Alan Shaw : They are certainly new \u2013 they are a new level of product that is not out there in the marketplace right now, or had not been. We're confident that it's going to be \u2013 it's going to help us grow moving forward. And as I noted, we are going to be very aggressive in launching new products based on the capacity dividend and the service product that Mike and his team are delivering. Mike Wheeler : And the good news, most of that folds into the current intermodal network that we have now. Alan Shaw : And we've got our investments in place in our intermodal network. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen & Company. Q - Jason Seidl Thank you, operator. Jim and team, good morning. Mike, congratulations on the retirement and listening. Welcome. I wanted to talk a little bit about your end markets. And if you can sort of give us an idea sort of what percentage of your end markets sort of started to come back in 2Q and what percent are out still here as we look in \u2013 as we operate in 3Q? Alan Shaw : Jason, we \u2013 as we've talked about, about 70% of our business is tied to the consumer economy and that certainly has improved sharply in June and July. And that we maintain our optimism for that through the third quarter. We also saw some improvement as well, though, in the energy market, but you're still talking about pretty difficult year-over-year comparisons there. So we're seeing lift in all of our markets, sharper lift within the consumer-oriented products that we serve. Jason Seidl : Okay. That's good color. And the other one and Jim, this might be one for you. But you've got a joint venture with PanAm up in New England. That railroad has been put up for sale. Just wondering, is this something that Norfolk would look at? And sort of how would it work if another class one took over that railroad? Jim Squires : Pan Am Southern is an important part of our network. It is our presence in New England and we're committed to maintaining a presence in New England as part of our overall network footprint and let me leave it at that. Operator : Thank you. At this time, this concludes our question-and-answer session. And I will now hand the call back to Mr. Jim Squires for closing comments. Jim Squires : Thank you for your questions this morning. Before we close, I want to take a moment to affirm for everyone on the call, whether you're an investor, customer or employee or other stakeholder of our company, Norfolk Southern's commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion. At a time when our society is experiencing dramatic upheaval, it's important to state in this forum that such a commitment is essential to delivering shareholder value. By pursuing measures that ensure inclusion and equal opportunity inside our company and in our interactions with others, we will serve our bottom line and our shareholders well. Thank you and be safe. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",

Additionally, a transcript and downloads will be posted after the call. It is now my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's Chairman, President and CEO, Jim Squires. Jim Squires : Good morning, and welcome to Norfolk Southern's Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. On the call with me today are Cindy Sanborn, Chief Operating Officer; Alan Shaw, Chief Marketing Officer; and Mark George, Chief Financial Officer. Before diving into our third quarter results, I'll highlight a previously disclosed noncash impairment charge of $99 million, related to an equity method investment. Slide 4 provides an adjusted view of our financials, excluding this charge, which is the view I will speak to in my comments this morning. During the third quarter, our volumes decreased 7% year-over-year, while adjusted operating expenses were down 15%, more than double the volume decline. On an adjusted basis, we reported our best operating ratio to date, but this is just the beginning. As we continue rolling out PSR, our team sees additional opportunities for efficiency and growth that will close the OR gap with the rest of the industry, driving shareholder value creation. As our third quarter results demonstrate, we are implementing sustainable cost structure improvements across our company. Employment levels are down 25% since the start of 2019, while active locomotives have decreased by 26%. We have advanced these resource improvements every quarter since launching TOP21 last year, including most recently by decreasing headcount by 2% sequentially in the third quarter, even as volumes surged 22%. We converted a fifth hump yard in the quarter, and you will hear from Cindy regarding further network enhancements that are underway. In the coming quarters, we will identify and execute on additional productivity initiatives to yield further efficiency gains. Turning to network performance. Even as we implemented deep and lasting cost structural moves in the third quarter, we ran a fast and fluid network with train speed, terminal dwell, train performance and shipment consistency, all better than before TOP21. We've now pushed train size to record levels. Finally, we are excited to have Cindy Sanborn join us as Chief Operating Officer. Cindy came to NS to drive operational change and improvement, bringing decades of experience and a deep commitment to precision scheduled railroading. Cindy has made it clear she sees many opportunities to increase efficiency and bottom line results at NS, and I know she looks forward to sharing her thoughts. Cindy? Cindy Sanborn : Thank you, Jim. I am very excited to lead operations and look forward to participating in the analyst calls as Chief Operating Officer. For those of you I've not yet met, I've been railroading for 33 years and have experience working for several Class I railroads. My experience has included driving change and achieving what PSR is all about, being efficient, consistent and improving the operating ratio. What drew me to Norfolk Southern are the significant opportunities ahead. Each railroad is different in terms of markets and customer mix, but I believe we can and will operate at the very best levels of the industry. Across the organization, I am finding a team that is committed to driving efficiency while delivering the highest quality service to our customers. I know that we have great potential and are just getting started, making this company more productive. Moving to Slide 6. We have a strong foundation in place, but we still have a lot more work to do and we need to move faster. Our top priority is building on the momentum underway by taking steps to further unlock our PSR capabilities. We are taking a bottoms-up approach to reviewing each part of the operation, and I am confident we will find opportunities to apply principles that have been successful during prior experiences. In my 58 days here, I've already found opportunities that will help us improve and achieve higher levels of productivity. We are transitioning to put additional focus on railcar velocity. This scrutiny at the most granular level represents a big opportunity to convert structural change into gains in fuel efficiency, train size, equipment utilization and service levels. Turning to the quarter on Slide 7. Our mission was to absorb returning volumes with minimal additional cost. We successfully achieved this goal and in so doing, made significant network changes that we expect to yield ongoing efficiencies. Here we see continued year-over-year improvements in our service and productivity metrics. By leveraging the increased volumes versus the second quarter, we drove improved productivity while maintaining stable service metrics. Returning volumes, combined with disciplined execution and successful control of additional train starts, enabled us to drive train weight and fuel efficiency to record levels. I've added train length to the metrics shown here because we actively manage train length, and this represents another opportunity for improvement. I've included a snapshot of our train length history in the appendix, because it is important that we have a baseline for measurement. Across these efficiency indicators, we have significant opportunities for improvement. The graph on the next slide is an updated illustration of our train productivity since the onset of the pandemic. As volume continued to ramp up throughout the quarter, we kept crew starts virtually flat in August and September. Instead of reverting to previous train plans, we blended traffic into our new train plan to leverage the existing available capacity. The more important takeaway is that most of our train plan still has capacity to absorb traffic, and our initiatives on car velocity and train size are designed to produce even more productivity. Moving to Slide 9 to discuss where we are structurally with network configuration. As you already know, the beginning of the transformation included the idling of the hump at two yards last year. Then in the second quarter of this year, two more were idle for a total of four. But as you've heard the team say many times, we are focused on creating additional opportunities for improvement. In September, we stopped using the hump at Enola, Pennsylvania, the fifth hump to go down since last year. The change at Enola avoids an upcoming capital investment and will result in a more reliable and faster operation. Next week, we are kicking off a much larger set of changes in the South. When we stop hump operations at our yard in Macon, Georgia. Concurrently, we will also close several local yards in the Atlanta area. These changes enable us to rework many of our Southeastern intermodal flows for improved service, lower cost and additional growth capacity. After the Macon conversion, we will have curtailed operations at six humps in just the past 18 months, leaving us with four high-volume hump yards. Before I conclude, I want to emphasize the team is moving with a sense of urgency. The make and change is just one example of how we have accelerated our plans to create efficiencies. That project originally planned for early 2021 is being executed more quickly. I said it earlier, but let me reiterate, this is just the beginning. Our opportunities are significant. And I am excited about keeping you up to speed on the progress we are going to make. Now I will turn it over to Alan, who will cover the market outlook. Alan Shaw : Thank you, Cindy, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, volume improved sequentially as business levels continued to recover from April and May lows. Consumer-driven markets are driving the gains reflected in our intermodal and automotive franchises, which delivered year-over-year volume growth in the third quarter. Norfolk Southern and our customers are responding to market needs amid an extremely tight truck market, playing to the strengths of our service-focused product and our robust consumer-oriented franchise. We continue to enhance our pipeline for growth with sustained investment by our customers along our lines. We checked the pulse of economic trends and market shifts, innovating supply chain solutions for existing and potential customers. These solutions evolve as the environment changes, as exemplified by the COVID-induced supply chain shifts and the need for increased inventory levels and faster distribution. Our strong customer relationships and market knowledge have allowed us to respond to these market shifts and quickly secure new business. Moving to Slide 11. Revenue for the quarter declined 12% year-over-year, driven by 39% decline in our energy-related markets, while our remaining markets declined 4%. Overall volume was down 7% as growth in intermodal and automotive partially offset energy declines. Price gains have now produced higher revenue per unit less fuel for 15 consecutive quarters in both our merchandise and intermodal business units. Overall, RPU was impacted by the negative mix associated with increased intermodal volume and lower fuel surcharges. The continued effects of the pandemic and lower energy prices led to 10% decline in merchandise revenue for the quarter. Recovery in the automotive sector partially offset these declines with revenue 9% higher than prior year levels as manufacturers increase vehicle production to meet consumer demand. Merchandise RPU less fuel increased 3% year-over-year as we continued to deliver solid service. Our intermodal volumes surpassed 2019 levels with growth in our domestic franchise. E-commerce activity and record tight truck capacity strengthened demand that was further enhanced by new intermodal services and our superior franchise. International volume growth improved throughout the quarter, with September daily volumes 13% above July. Intermodal revenue and RPU were impacted by lower fuel surcharge revenue, with RPU less fuel up 3% due to positive price and mix. Coal revenue declined 38% year-over-year due to sustained low natural gas prices and high inventories. Utility volumes fell 30% but improved on a sequential basis with warmer than normal weather Year-over-year, export continued to face demand challenges and low seaborne pricing. Moving to our outlook on Slide 12. We expect continued strength in our consumer oriented markets. The energy market will remain a headwind but its impact has decreased as coal revenue represented 10% of our top line in the third quarter. External economic forecasts remain optimistic and expect continued improvement as the economy adjusts. The impacts of lower interest rates and improved personnel income will continue to drive spending in the consumer markets with housing starts and durable goods spending experiencing V-shaped recoveries. Manufacturing has been slower to recover and has not kept pace with sales, evidenced by the declining inventory sales ratio, a positive indicator for future transportation demand. Truck capacity is at the tightest level on record, also generating a greater need and opportunity for Norfolk Southern's product. Within merchandise, the negative impacts of low energy prices will continue to be a drag on energy volume in the fourth quarter. Strength in the soybean export market will mitigate some of that headwind, while the automotive recovery will benefit adjacent markets like steel and plastics. Norfolk Southern's automotive volume is expected to decrease sequentially due to plant downtime associated with model changeovers, offsetting increased production from other plants. We are collaborating with our customers to deliver supply chain solutions to help them compete in an evolving market. Intermodal's continued strength will be supported by economic factors, including e-commerce, low inventories and a tight truck market, as well as in-house initiatives promoting new products and highway conversions. Deep supply chain disruptions from COVID have led many of our customers to reevaluate how they move goods to reduce risk. We are working with our best-in-class channel partners on new opportunities, delivering a truck like product and providing capacity to move their business safely and efficiently. We continue to leverage our capacity dividend from efficiency improvements to expand our business, built upon the foundation of our robust and flexible intermodal franchise. Within coal, we expect the utility market to face pressure associated with high stockpiles and low natural gas prices. Export volumes are likely to improve sequentially, although seaborne prices will remain below prior year levels. At Norfolk Southern, we remain poised to continue to seize immediate opportunities for growth at the same time that we strategize to the long game, focused on delivering profitable growth to our shareholders, while serving our customers and growing our franchise. We are executing this strategy with investments already made in consumer driven markets that provide access to over half of the US population, positioned to succeed in the fastest growing segments of the US economy. We will continue to realize the value of our service product, maintaining our focus on profitable growth through both revenue and volume. We built and maintained strong relationships with our strategic partners and provide them with an excellent service product, meeting their needs and allowing our customers and Norfolk Southern to grow profitably and sustainably, which I will discuss further on Slide 13. Through our powerful intermodal franchise and best-in-class network of industrial development sites, short line partnerships and transload facilities, which serve to expand the reach of our rail product, we are delivering more options than ever to a marketplace that is increasingly valuing low carbon transportation solutions. Our unique pioneering role in sustainability is evidenced by our decade-long participation in force carbon offset programs in South Carolina and along the Mississippi River, as well as our wetland restoration projects. In addition, we continue to reduce our impact by enhancing fuel efficiency, which you heard from Cindy, as we modernize our locomotive fleet and deploy energy management solutions. We have partnered with customers as part of a pledge called Operation Clean Suite to prevent plastic pollution while it is in transit. These are just a few of the reasons Norfolk Southern was recently named one of the 100 most sustainably managed companies in the world by the Wall Street Journal. Rail is three to four times more fuel-efficient than truck and our leadership and sustainability resonates with our customers and the markets we serve, and will be an important aspect of the continuing growth story across our truck competitive segments as we leverage our commitment to sustainability. I will now turn it over to Mark, who will cover our financial results. Mark George : Thank you, Alan. Good morning, everyone. On Slide 15, you see the key financial measures. I'll talk on this slide and in the remainder of the presentation to the adjusted numbers, excluding the impact of the $99 million impairment charge. Revenue was down 12% on volume that was down 7%. As Alan shared, RPU ex-fuel for our merchandise and intermodal segments was positive but declining fuel surcharge revenue, along with adverse business mix, including within coal, created revenue headwinds. We drove down operating expenses 15% in the quarter with comp and ben, purchased services, fuel and materials, all declining by double digit percentages, solidly in excess of the volume decline. This resulted in operating income being down 6% and an operating ratio of 62.5%, that was 240 basis points better than Q3 of 2019. Despite the $57 million decline in operating income, free cash flow of $1.7 billion for the nine months was more durable, up by $211 million or 14%, a record for AMS. On Slide 16, you'll see the walk of our adjusted earnings from Q3 2019 referenced at the bottom has a 240 basis point improvement in or and $0.02 increase in EPS. You will recall that in Q3 2019, we had a receivable write off that adversely impacted operating income, creating a favorability in the compares this quarter by 110 basis points in the OR and $0.09 on EPS. That leaves core OR improvement in Q3 2020 as 130 basis points while EPS declined by $0.07. The OR improvement was driven by strong operating expense reductions versus last year, as you'll see on Slide 17. Operating expenses were down $278 million or 15%. Comp and benefits are down 15%, led mainly by our employment cost with the workforce down by 4,400 or 18%. Fuel was down $100 million with lower pump prices contributing to $61 million of that reduction and consumption was down $36 million, led by fewer GTMs, as well as a strong 6% improvement in fuel efficiency in the quarter. Material spend was down $13 million due to lower spend associated with smaller and more efficient locomotive and railcar fleets. Purchased services was down $35 million or 10% as we continue evaluating the structural and semi-structural costs within this category. I'll point out that the depreciation increase of $7 million was due to a nonrecurring leasehold improvement write off due to a terminated lease. Given the amount of structural change that we're driving into the business each and every month, I'd like to touch on how we have recovered from the volume trough in the second quarter on Slide 18. As background, recall in Q2 we did a tremendous amount of work to manage the short-term by more than matching the volume decline with crew start leverage while also forging ahead with structural change by idling two hump operations and driving headcount down 20%. As a result, we positioned ourselves very well for Q3 and beyond to leverage these sustainable cost structure improvements. From Q2 levels, revenue increased 20% or $421 million, while we constrained cost to just 6% growth to deliver nearly 80% incremental margins. We drove headcount down another 2% versus Q2. Materials, purchase services and equipment rents combined for an increase of only 6% on the 20% sequential revenue gain. And fuel efficiency improved 3 points sequentially as increases to train weight and length continued to record levels, as Cindy highlighted. We are confident that our advancing implementation of PSR is producing benefits, and we have great momentum to build on our cost structure improvements moving forward. On Slide 19, we look at the full P&L, with a Q3 to Q3 look. And here, you'll see that other income net of $39 million is $17 million better than prior year. We had another strong quarter of gains on our company owned life insurance investments. These COLI returns, including proceeds, are not subject to income tax as they contributed to our lower effective tax rate in the quarter of 22%, as did the tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation. This is why net income contraction was only 2% compared to the 6% contraction in operating income. Adjusted EPS, you'll note, was actually up 1% supported by nearly $300 million of share repurchase activity in the quarter. Shifting to cash flow on Slide 20. Through nine months ended September 2020, our free cash flow was a record at $1.7 billion, aided in large part by fewer capital additions, as well as timing of income tax payments. Spend on property additions was $1.05 billion, nearly $450 million below 2019 levels and on a run rate to be at our target of roughly $1.5 billion for the year, which will be 25% reduction from 2019 spend levels. With our strong cash generation and liquidity profile, we were able to continue to distribute cash to shareholders through our dividend while ramping back up share repurchase activity. In the quarter, we repurchased 1.4 million shares for roughly $300 million. As of now, we have approximately $1.4 billion of cash on hand with less than $100 million of debt maturities in the next year, providing us confidence that we have appropriate liquidity in this uncertain market. With that, I'll hand back over to Jim. Jim Squires : Thank you, Mark. Before we conclude, I want to recognize all of our employees for their dedication to operating this railroad as efficiently and safely as possible, while continuing to deliver for our customers during these unprecedented times. As you've heard this morning, our leadership team is unified in a commitment to improving Norfolk Southern, and will leave no stone unturned in the quest for shareholder value. We are confident our momentum will enable us to achieve our goal of 60% operating ratio. And once we get there, we won't stop as we drive additional improvements across our network. In closing, we have built an organization that is moving faster than ever to deliver returns for shareholders. Thank you for your attention. And we'll now open the line for Q&A. Operator? Operator : Thank you [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Jon Chapell with Evercore ISI. Jon Chappell : Good morning, everybody. Alan, I want to start with you. You mentioned briefly that some of your auto customers are shutting down in the fourth quarter, so do you expect a sequential decline? But if we look across autos and intermodal, incredibly strong third quarter, maybe the start to the fourth quarter a little bit less robust. Is there anything happening within the network, whether it's some of the initiatives that Cindy is putting into place? Or is this really a focus on yield as you try to manage your capacity in a tight market? Alan Shaw : Jon, we do have some specific planned outages and retooling in the fourth quarter within our automotive franchise that are going to create some pressure. I'll circle back to the results in the third quarter. Our revenue was up 9% year-over-year, and our audit team is working every day to make a better franchise for our customers. And so that's -- the phenomenon that you're seeing right now is a short term phenomenon. We've got a lot of confidence in the strength in our automotive franchise moving forward. Same with the intermodal franchise. We're delivering record volumes within domestic and international volumes are starting to tick into the positive territory for us right now. So we're very confident in the strength of that franchise and basically all of our consumer oriented markets moving forward. I'll tell you that Cindy is focused on improving productivity. She's also focused on giving our customers a very good service product. Jon Chappell : That's a good lead into my quick follow-up to Cindy. Just curious as have you been there now for two months. Is your kind of initiative to come in from the top-down with maybe a new team and invoke some pretty significant changes? Or you just taking what the MS has already been doing over the last year and half and kind of tweaking here and there? Cindy Sanborn : I would say that there's a very strong foundation that's been built here and been operating here, very focused on the basics of running a good railroad. And I'm looking at it from the bottom-up and from the top down, and it's really more than tweaking, it\u2019s ignificantly more than tweaking. I introduced some information around train length. We're going to be working on that. That helps us tremendously with our locomotive productivity as well as fuel. And we will also be working very strongly on car velocity. A lot of these hump conversions that you've seen that were referenced in my earlier remarks, the team has engaged in at a discrete level actually improves car speed and at a system level, what we want to do is avoid touches altogether, if at all possible. And if we can speed the cars up, that's good for us in terms of asset intensity and it's also good for our customers. It provides them a more timely service product. So there's quite a bit of work going on. And I'm really excited about the team here and excited about exactly what we're going to be working on. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Justin Long : So maybe to start, I wanted to ask about headcount. Is there any color you can provide on your expectations for headcount sequentially going into the fourth quarter? And then maybe same question on the OR. Even if it's just directionally, would love to get your thoughts about 4Q and what we could see based on demand today? Thanks. Jim Squires : Justin, well, let me tackle the second question first, and then I'll ask Mark to address the headcount trend. We're not going to give quarterly guidance. You see the volume trend. We're working away on the expenses. I think it would be reasonable to expect an operating ratio in the fourth quarter below last year. But beyond that we're not going to give guidance. Mark, the employment trend? Mark George : So as you saw, the employment trends are quite strong. We took out 4,400 or 18% since Q3 2019, actually, 2,900 so far in the nine months of 2020. And sequentially, we did come down. I do believe that volume growth and attrition are both our friends from this point forward. Not going to give a specific target for Q4, but the hope is that we certainly won't add here in the fourth quarter. And hopefully, with attrition being our friend we might see continued decline. Justin Long : And then, Cindy, maybe one for you. When you look at that 500 to 600 basis point margin gap versus your Eastern competitor today. I wanted to ask about how that gap looks in general merchandise versus intermodal. Is one of those segments -- does one of those segments need to play more catch up than the other from a margin perspective as you look to close that gap? Cindy Sanborn : Justin, I think about every railroad kind of has a difference in terms of markets and customer mix. But our network is as good as any and I don't see any barriers to us continuing to reduce the gap between us and our competitor here in the east in both markets that you described, both merchandise and intermodal. We're going to drive very hard in that direction. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Jason Seidl : I wanted to stay with Cindy there for a while. Cindy, you mentioned your great amount of railroad experience you've been at two Class 1s that have implemented PSR. Can you talk a little bit about what you learned there with PSR and how you think you can apply that Norfolk Southern? And also what might be different? Cindy Sanborn : Well, I would say, Jason, that PSR at its core is just very basic railroading. And focusing on making every move count and accelerating asset intensity or improving asset intensity is the core of it. And no matter which railroad I\u2019ve worked for that has really been the effort as we implemented PSR. I don't see things different at Norfolk Southern. I see a workforce and a team that I've inherited that is very focused and very energized about what we're working on. They understand just how much work it's going to be. And I think we're going to be able to close the gap with any railroad in the country. Jason Seidl : And Cindy, as a quick follow-up, as Norfolk starts gaining more and more ground with PSR. How should we think about maybe the gains on capital investments? Because it seems like closing some hump yards that have already eliminated some capital investments. Are there more to come? Should we expect a smaller capital investment profile going forward as you guys make progress? Cindy Sanborn : Jason, I actually haven't gotten that far into the details on capital. I would say that you will see us make some investments in locomotives that you might not see otherwise as we convert from a DC fleet to an AC fleet and so forth. But at this point, I really can't answer that question terribly fully. But Mark, I'm sure has a view, and I'll turn it to him. Mark George : It's a very good question and observation. And actually, the Enola closure, the home closure is an example where we will be avoiding some capital. So you do see some relief there. And the same thing, even the locomotive impairment that we took back in the first quarter where we idled 703 locomotives kind of reveals that we do feel with all this PSR momentum we have that we've got enough in the locomotive fleet. And hopefully, we won't be buying locomotives anytime soon. So I do think some of the transformations that we're making will relieve us of CapEx demands. But that said, Cindy is coming in and really taking a look at traffic patterns and looking at our train plan, and there may be areas where we need to do some siding extensions, as an example, to help accelerate the network. So overall, we are still working on that. Cindy and I have been spending a lot of time along with Alan, trying to understand some of the ideas and observations that she's had coming in. And we'll know better, I think, as we enter the first quarter, what the overall impact will be on capital, certainly in the next year or two. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Allison Landry : So given the step function improvements that you've made in train length and weight, I guess, first, how much further room do you have here? And then are there any parts of the network that might need additional sidings to keep the train length moving higher? And then if you could speak to how you're thinking about operating leverage and incremental margins in 2021, given these productivity improvements as well as the recent volume and SM? Jim Squires : Allison, let me start out and then I'll turn it over to Cindy to fill in the details. But as you noted, we did achieve significant asset and other resource productivities in the third quarter. For example, we had record performance on fuel efficiency, train weight, train length, teaming productivity and locomotive productivity. So virtually, across the board record levels of productivity. But that's just the beginning. As Cindy has just gone through, she sees and we see lots of additional opportunities for improvement. And those improvement opportunities will take the form of asset velocity, a focus on railcar velocity, which is something she has brought to us. It's a signature initiative or focus within PSR. We'll continue to look at the network footprint. We'll continue to look at labor and all other aspects of our operation. And indeed, our company in search of productivities that will propel us towards the goal of the peer-operating ratios. Cindy? Cindy Sanborn : I think if we look at September, and I was looking at some numbers here, literally in the last couple of days. In our merchandise network, we operated with tonnage up to what our locomotives could pull. So maxing out that locomotive capability about 9% of the time. And we look at our intermodal opportunity in terms of length, where we're going over 10,000 feet, we had about 10% of our trains over 10,000 feet for the entire district. So we had a lot of opportunity here. It may, as Mark alluded to, it's on the radar to think about where there might be barriers to that from a side link perspective. Don't really have that completely flushed out. But we do have significant opportunity to improve our trend line. Jim Squires : Allison, you mentioned incremental margin going forward. Mark, why don't you take a stab at that? Mark George : As you know, Allison, we had very strong sequential growth in the top line here from Q2 to Q3, that allowed us to really leverage it and deliver 78% incremental margin. And frankly, that's the recipe we're hoping for going forward that we can get good volume growth here, and our goal would be to leverage it and deliver very strong incremental margins. Now I don't know that we can do 78% to 80% every single quarter. I think it will depend on how much volume we get and where that volume comes from. But certainly, I would expect that we would have accretive incremental margins in each quarter where we do have growth. Cindy Sanborn : And let me also add that these numbers that I provided, it's not something you're going to be able to do 100% of the time. There's going to be situations where you're not going to reach perfection. But that's what we have to work toward. And we're going to be -- that's all part of closing the gap that we've got here on cost. And that's just some of the ingredients and the concepts, and areas that we're looking at to find those opportunities. Allison Landry : So as my follow-up, is there a way to think about or quantify the cost savings or the OR benefit from the network changes that you made, hump closures, et cetera? And then more broadly, do you see opportunities for further rationalization, whether that's yards or facilities, or other assets? Curious maybe what's left to do. And if there's anything you're considering as far as changes to the coal network? Thank you. Cindy Sanborn : Let me add one component in terms of the terminal footprint. So the team has redesigned traffic flows through the terminals and we're continuing to do that with the make and change that we're talking about. But once we sort of go through it the first time, we don't stop looking. We go back to areas that we've looked -- that we've converted, and we continue to optimize the operation through those areas. So we most recently made some train consolidations that are a result of the changes we made at Bellevue that we just have put in place, as we have seen traffic balance out and traffic continue to change, and allow us to continue to optimize, I guess, is the best word, how we think about traffic flows through the areas that we've already been through. So a lot of -- it's not like you go through this one time and it's done. It's continuous improvement and continuous focus and driving our cost gap reduction. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Chris Wetherbee : I wanted to touch on the 60% OR target. Kind of curious if you guys are comfortable reinstating or putting a time around that. Is it something that's achievable next year? And then maybe if you don't want to comment on the timing, can we talk a little bit sort of structurally, do you think you have the pieces in place? I'm thinking about the hump yard slide. Structurally, is the network kind of where it needs to be as volume comes back, that there's a clear line of sight for the sixth year? Is there more work to be done? Jim Squires : Well, let me summarize, Chris. As we've noted several times already, our goal is to close the OR gap with our peers. And along the way, we will naturally get to 60% operating ratio. We believe we have line of sight to 60% during 2021 through a combination of cost reductions and revenue growth. But we're not going to stop there and we'll continue to drive harder and get that OR into the peer range and as low as we possibly can, which ought to generate a great deal of shareholder value. The progress will come from a combination of productivity and efficiency initiatives, as we've been discussing already this morning and revenue growth in sight during 2021. Chris Wetherbee : As a quick follow-up for Alan. Can we talk a little bit about the intermodal competitive environment and specifically the yield up strategy? I think it was another record intermodal yield ex-fuel this year. Can you talk a little bit about sort of the opportunity as you turn the page into 2021 in terms of taking share? You have the cycle kind of turning in your favor from a truckload perspective. You have a pretty decent competitor in the east is also wanting to grow that business. Can you just put a little bit of context on how you think about how intermodal looks as we move forward over the next several quarters? Alan Shaw : Chris, through strategic foresight market approach, we've got the most robust intermodal franchise in the east, and we are aligned with the best channel partners in the business who are also committed to growth. I think we're in a very unique truck environment. What you've seen is that truck capacity is inelastic with demand. And so spot rates are at two, three year highs. Capacity is about as tight as it's been and we're in the midst of a prolonged inventory replenishment cycle. And as I noted, we're getting record volumes in domestic right now and our international business is ticking up into positive territory. So I'm very confident about where we're going the remainder of this year and next year. And it's just a continuation of what we've delivered. Remember, in 2017, our revenue was up 11%. We followed that with 18% improvement in 2018, it declined very slightly last year in the midst of a truck recession. And right now, it's back to growth. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Ari Rosa with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Ari Rosa : So first question, I wanted to touch on how you're thinking about available capacity because, obviously, you've done a great job here of cutting resources. But as we see volume growth into 2021. Do you think you can take that without further adding to headcount or take on additional resources? Mark George : Yes, plenty of capacity, particularly in light of our goal and our intent to increase train length. That right there, will absorb additional volume into the train plan. As far as infrastructure is concerned with the possible exception of some spot places where we need to increase siding lengths, we have more than adequate infrastructure capacity right now. Jim Squires : And I\u2019ll add that the way the markets are shaping up, the incremental volume will largely fold into existing train network. We've redesigned our network so that we've got capacity. You saw that in the incremental margins in the third quarter. And these consumer-oriented markets, whether it's in the merchandise network or the intermodal, additional growth is going to be all about creating additional revenue density on our trains. Cindy Sanborn : And as we increase our train length, that reduces the number of trains, actually, on the network, which frees up capacity and line growth. So there's a number of levers here from a capacity perspective that we have in our favor. Ari Rosa : And then just looking at the evolution of PSR across some other railroads in North America. Obviously, it's opened up a lot of real estate opportunities for them. And I know you guys have taken some actions in that regard. But maybe you could talk about where you think you are in terms of the real estate footprint? What we could see in terms of opportunities for either real estate sales or maybe leveraging some available real estate to grow incremental volumes, which are clearly doing at very high margins? And so maybe just a couple of thoughts on where you are with your real estate strategy. Mark George : This is Mark. I'll let Alan talk a little bit more about the tactics there. But I would say that we typically, right now, liberate about $30 million to $40 million of land per year, we generate gains from that and that is, we've got plenty of properties out there that contribute to that. And I think, Alan, why don't you talk a little bit more about what the strategies are. Alan Shaw : Within real estate, we're focused on delivering cash flow via two means. One is land sales. The other is through ongoing leases. And our real estate team is linked very closely with our best-in-class industrial development team to work to cite additional business on our lines. And you just saw one announced in a Delfood product that was recently announced on our network. It's one of the reasons that we serve more North American vehicle production than any other railroad. And then in addition to that, our real estate strategy is also about sustainability. And we're using some wetland credits on our real estate to provide offsets for infrastructure improvements on our lines to increase our capacity and also to help with local economic development, which will drive more business in Norfolk Southern. So it's a multifaceted approach, all designed to improve ongoing profits for Norfolk Southern and our shareholders. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please proceed with your question. Cherilyn Radbourne : That was my question on real estate, so maybe I'll ask one on technology. And just ask whether you could give us a bit more color on the joint venture that you announced last week, and speak a bit more broadly about technology and whether you're looking at some of the automated inspection technologies that your peers are adopting? Alan Shaw : Let me take the question about technology. It is a core part of our strategy. One of our strategy pillars is digital strategy and development of technology to promote both efficiency and growth in our operations. Particular areas of focus in the digital realm in recent years have been customer engagement and making sure that we have best-in-class customer tools, tracking tools and shipment intelligence tools. We've devoted quite a bit of technology, time and effort in that area. We're also very focused on improving asset productivity through technology, and that does include automated inspections. Yes, we are focused on that, and we see a significant opportunity there. And in other areas as well, replenishment of legacy information systems and artificial intelligence initiatives, machine vision initiatives, there's a raft of initiatives coming at us. And we're very excited about the prospects for promoting shareholder value through those investments. Jim Squires : Charilyn, specific to your question about the recently announced rail pulse, that's just another example. Norfolk Southern innovating within the supply chain ecosystem, provide a value added truck competitive product. That's our partnership with G&W, and Watco, and GATX, and Trinity Rail. Combined with us, that's about 20% of the North American railcar fleet. And what we're focused on doing is providing focus on improving safety and transparency within the overall ecosystem so that we can provide a truck competitive product. Operator : Next question comes from the line of David Ross with Stifel. David Ross : I wanted to talk a little bit about intermodal again, because it's been a very hot area, and maybe it's due to the yield up strategy. But volumes are only up about 2% or 3% on the Northfolk Southern last week. So I wanted to know, I guess, why you think you're not seeing the same volume growth? Is that purposeful because of the yield choice, or is there something else going on in the network or with the customers? Mark George : We're starting to see improvements within our international business, and we're looking for some gains as the quarter progresses from the West Coast. And so we're very confident about where our intermodal franchise is. David Ross : Do you think it will be high single-digit growth in the fourth quarter? Mark George : No. I'm not going to provide guidance on it, but intermodal was a growth driver for us in the third quarter along with automotive, and we expect it to be a growth driver for us in the fourth quarter as well. We've got an unrivaled intermodal franchise in the east, and we're in a very tight truck market. We're providing a really good service product. David Ross : And then just last question because we've got the election coming up next week, Jim. Is there anything, one way or the other, that has a bigger impact on the rails? Is there something that maybe you're most concerned about or most excited about if it goes one way or the other? Jim Squires : Well, we'll work through the implications of the election outcome either way. And of course, we have close relationships on both sides of the aisle. We maintain constant communication with all those who support the rail industry and Norfolk Southern, in particular. So I'm confident that we will navigate through whatever political changes may come. We've been at this for a long time and are active in the political realm. And so I have a lot of confidence that we can manage through whatever changes may be on the horizon. Operator : Next question is from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Jordan Alliger : I understand on the mix side, revenue per carload, the impact of intermodal on the total RPU of the business. I'm just sort of curious like within the specific commodity, like chemicals were up 6%, agriculture was down 1%, there's a couple of others that were negative year-over-year. Is that mostly a function of the fuel surcharge? Is there a length of fall issues? Again, I understand sort of the total. I'm just sort of wondering within a commodity category, what's been the biggest driver of the RPU? And when do you think you could start to see some of that total RPU negative mix start to look a little more normalized? Thanks. Jim Squires : Most of our RPU pressure right now is coming from fuel surcharge and from seaborne coking coal pricing, which we've provided some color on in the past. Unwind our RPU a little bit, you're going to see 15 consecutive quarters of RPU less fuel growth, both merchandise and in intermodal. And even within intermodal, we just posted a record for RPU less fuel. So we're fully committed to revenue growth and we understand that that's got two components. One of that's price. One of that's volume. And we're providing the most stable service product that we ever have over a long time period, and we are positioned for where markets are headed. Strength in the consumer is where NS is positioned and where we excel. Jordan Alliger : So I mean, presumably, then as the fuel stuff starts to normalize, the revenue per carload as we move, I'm assuming, into next year, or maybe\u2026 Jim Squires : I think I identified the two headwinds. Look at our revenue per revenue ton mile, up 3% for the quarter. Operator : The next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott Group : So wanted to just ask on some of the cost pieces, Mark, and any way to think about comp per employee going forward? And then purchase services were down, I think down year-over-year for the first time. Is that sustainable sort of inflection in purchase services? And then maybe if we just tie it all together, when you talk about line of sight to 60% OR next year. What level of revenue growth, if any, do you think you need to get there? Mark George : The comp per employee sequentially looking forward into Q4, I'd say, is likely to be in the flattish range. This quarter, obviously, we were up very, very modestly at 1.3%. I would expect us to be flat going into Q4. Sorry, the second question\u2026 Scott Group : Just purchase services and\u2026 Mark George : So purchase services, I thought we did a very good job. We've got some of the structural changes that we've been implementing kind of flowing through that line as well. So pretty good momentum going into the fourth quarter. I do think as volume steps up, especially in intermodal we'll start to see purchase services elevate a bit in conjunction with volume and that volume variability equation. Jim Squires : And Scott, your question about line of sight 2% to 60% during 2021. A combination of cost reductions and revenue growth would be our expectation. And we do expect to see a rebound in revenue next year and growth year-over-year during 2021. So it will come from the two, but we have a lot of productivity initiatives in the hopper. And I think we've shown that during times of volume softness this year that we are fully committed to the PSR way, and to driving cost structural improvements throughout the organization. So that will be something we continue to rely on as we push for that pure OR. Scott Group : But just directionally, if you have thoughts. I mean, do you think you need -- can you get there next year with mid-single-digit kind of revenue growth? Do you need closer to high single with easy comps to get there? Just any directional thoughts as you look. Jim Squires : Give us time to firm up our revenue outlook, and we'll talk a little bit more about what we expect for year come January. We're still working on our forecasts right now. Things appear to be headed in the right direction. We would expect growth year-over-year. But we'll get back to you a little more detailed outlook in January. Operator : The next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Brian Ossenbeck : Maybe one for Alan. We've seen a few coal plant retirements announced in the last month or so. It looks like it's more of a western rail issue. But how do you see that risk for Norfolk based on the plans and miles that you serve? And given where natural gas is about $3 and export prices maybe stabilizing a little bit. Do you think you're past the peak of the headwinds when it comes to the coal from RTU perspective? Alan Shaw : Yes, Brian, I think the plant closures are a result of the economic factors that are driving it. Power prices in the PJM right now are below $20 a megawatt hour. Coal is going to have a really hard dispatching into that environment. And while natural gas has rebounded nicely to $3, the spot market is still below $2. It's closer to about $1.70, which is kind of what coal uses the dispatch is that spot market. So that's going to create continued pressure for us in the fourth quarter, in addition to the fact that stockpiles are about 45% higher than they were this time last year. We are seeing improvements in export demand, as I noted. Although with the Chinese, Australian trade tensions, the premium low vol price out on the seaborne market actually declined. They had climbed up to about $128 a metric ton. Now it's close about $115. So we'll see some more export volume in that and in thermal as China and India have opened up, but there's still going to be pressure on pricing there. Brian Ossenbeck : And just one follow-up on the comp per employee comment. Maybe, Mark, if you can give us a sense of how you think of overtime as potentially productivity lever you probably have to incur maybe a little bit more as you manage headcount with the volume environment is still a little bit uncertain. But as things sort of normalize and you start to draw that line of sight to the 60 OR. Do you think this is an area of significant opportunity or are there maybe factors that would prevent you from being able to take some significant savings on the OT line item? Mark George : We've done a pretty good job already bringing overtime down quite a bit. And it is another area that we are looking at going into the future. There's a lot of things, obviously, that impact the comp per employee, just increasing volumes has an impact on the T&E activity levels and the pay rates as well. So those are -- it's not just over time but it's also the activity levels in general. But I'd say we're looking at all the levers. The re-cruise is another area where we've done a good job tackling, trying to keep a lid on it. And I think if you look at our overall comp and ben trends over time, you've seen we've done a pretty good job keeping a lid on things, but we do see more opportunity going forward. And those are exactly some of the areas that Cindy and her team are talking about since she's come on board. Operator : We are nearing the end of our allotted time for question-and-answer session. And we have time for one additional question. And that question is coming from the line of Tom Marivitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Mike Triano : This is Mike Triano on for Tom. So I just wanted to ask about industrial related volumes. The energy complex is obviously weak. But are you optimistic that the continued improvement in some of the other segments like metals or housing, or do you see any headwinds as we enter into 2021? Jim Squires : We do see a lot -- we have a lot of confidence in our consumer oriented product, whether that's in industrial products or within intermodal. And I think we're going to see some improvements in ag. We're going to see improvements in metals. And intermodal is going to be a growth for us as well. And not only are we focused on growth, we're focused on productivity. Cindy talked a lot about some of the initiatives that she's implementing. And then within our intermodal network, we're applying technology and process improvement to improve the efficiency of the terminals and increase revenue density of the trains as well. So the consumer market is where NS is positioned. It's a position of strength for us and that's where we excel. Mike Triano : How much exposure leverage to housing you have in the overall book? And do you think that can be a meaningful driver, especially on the car loading side as we go forward here? Jim Squires : Exposure to housing? Is that what you asked? Unidentified Analyst : The housing. Yes. Jim Squires : It certainly helps with housing, housing products. As Mark noted, lumber, some steel and then you've got the stuff that goes in it. And it also really helps drive the intermodal product as well, as people furnish the house or some of our larger BCOs are involved in the housing market. So there's opportunities there. And as I noted, we're seeing a V-shaped recovery in both durable goods and in the housing market. So we've got a lot of confidence in these consumer oriented markets as we head into '21. Operator : At this time, I will turn the floor back over to Mr. Jim Squires for his closing comments. Jim Squires : Thanks, everyone, for your questions this morning. And special thanks to all the Norfolk Southern employees who helped us deliver a solid result in the third quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Pete Sharbel, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Sharbel. You may now begin. Pete Sharbel : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Please note that during today\u2019s call, we will make certain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, and may differ materially from actual results. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. Our presentation slides are available at norfolksouthern.com in the Investors section, along with our reconciliation of non-GAAP measures used today to the comparable GAAP measures. Additionally, a transcript and downloads will be posted after the call. It is now my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern\u2019s Chairman, President and CEO, Jim Squires. Jim Squires : Good morning. And welcome to Norfolk Southern\u2019s fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. Joining me today are Cindy Sanborn, Chief Operating Officer; Alan Shaw, Chief Marketing Officer; and Mark George, Chief Financial Officer. I\u2019d like to begin today by recognizing the hard work and dedication of all of our employees who persevered and adapted throughout 2020 to serve our customers and communities, and enhance shareholder value. As the past year unfolded, change was one of the few constants driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as a global shift in energy markets that significantly impacted our business. Our people day in and day out ensured that our railroad was positioned to succeed by delivering for our customers changing needs, while seizing efficiency opportunities that produced record productivity levels and advanced our PSR based operating plan. Moving to our results on slide four, for the quarter EPS was $2.64 and the operating ratio was an all time record at 61.8%. Prior to summarizing the full year results, I\u2019ll highlight two previously disclosed non-cash charges. First, recall in the first quarter, we launched a rationalization of our locomotive fleet by 703 units, which resulted in a non-cash charge of $385 million. This was possible due to the deep and lasting efficiency that we\u2019ve driven into our train network through precision scheduled railroading. Next, in the third quarter, we disclosed a $99 million non-cash impairment charge related to an equity method investment. I will speak to full year results excluding both of these charges. For the full year, revenues declined 13% as we experienced significant disruption in business levels from the dual impacts of the global pandemic and energy market changes. In response, we pressed forward with PSR initiatives and quickly adapted to control costs. And as a result, we more than offset the revenue decline with a 14% reduction in adjusted operating expenses. The adjusted operating ratio improved to 64.4%, which marks the fifth consecutive year of improvement. As we manage significant volume fluctuations throughout the pandemic, we idled four additional hump operations, streamlined our resources and completed a redesign of our Southern operations around Atlanta ahead of peak season. Since our launch of TOP21, we\u2019ve completed a total of six hump rationalizations and we\u2019ve substantially reduced our asset requirements. Our ongoing efforts to improve fuel efficiency and resource productivity produced our best results to-date. These actions contributed to another year of operating ratio of improvement on an adjusted basis and are especially crucial to drive profitability and efficiency even further in 2021. We see ample opportunity to affect more positive change and remain focused on closing the OR gap with the industry. Moving into 2021, we are committed to providing a superior value to shareholders and best-in-class service to customers through an efficient profitable operation. Building further upon record productivity and efficiency gains to foster a platform of growth. Increasing resilience in our service offering and creating latent capacity to grow with our customers is in lockstep with our goals to grow profitably and efficiently. This alignment is paramount as we continue to leverage our superior positioning to consumer and industrial markets that have been proven growth drivers for Norfolk Southern. We will leave no stone unturned as we drive efficiency and create value for our shareholders. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Cindy. Cindy Sanborn : Good morning. When I spoke to you last quarter, I had been at Norfolk Southern for less than two months, but I had already found a strong foundation and opportunities for us to maximize the value of our franchise. The most recent quarter has reinforced my belief in the magnitude of opportunity in front of us and that we are positioned to capture that opportunity. During the fourth quarter, we saw volumes continue their climb from pandemic induced lows earlier in the year, so the mission of the operating team was handling more business, while reducing resources and improving productivity. Our push for efficiency leads to record train weight and record train lengths in the quarter. These larger trains combined with our strategy of better matching train size and locomotive horsepower, drove us to record fuel efficiency and enabled us to get the job done with a smaller workforce and a record low count of locomotives. I also have to thank the people that make up our operations team and all crafts. We achieved these records due to their hard work, and most importantly, we did so safely. Turning to slide seven, our network performance throughout most of 2020 was strong, with many metrics at or above record performance levels even with unprecedented volume volatility. We accelerated network changes in the fourth quarter ahead of holiday peak season and as volume reached the highest point of the year. As you can see on the slide, our network fluidity metrics came under pressure as the quarter progressed. It is important to note that implementing these network changes as soon as possible, while challenging is a key to future success with our ongoing efficiency and growth initiatives, which I\u2019ll cover in more detail shortly. I can confidently say that we are meeting these challenges head on and have already improved fluidity in the first quarter as the black line on the graph indicates. We are focused on executing and improving the plan, and when necessary and justified deploying temporary resources to quickly address congested areas. For example, while we put locomotives into storage this quarter, we will use those locomotives temporarily if needed before returning them to inactive status. I have been very pleased with the way the team has risen to the challenge, especially during the holiday peak season when they upped their game to meet service expectations, even with additional premium intermodal traffic. Moving to slide eight, traffic coming back is both our challenge and an opportunity. We can and will add resources to meet customer needs, but first we must explore every option to fully utilize our existing crews and locomotives. We eliminate a lot of structural costs, including indirect and supporting costs during the pandemic. So we\u2019re being very careful to keep those costs from creeping back. Before we add a new service, the team goes through an extensive vetting process to explore the alternatives, including rebalancing traffic between existing trains and tactical extra trains. The focus is on using additional volume to help us increase the value we bring out of each locomotive and each crew start. Railcar velocity is our touchstone throughout as we push to quickly move volumes through the network. We have also made our organizational structure within operations more efficient during the quarter by reducing from nine to six geographic divisions and delayering our management structure to speed decision making and ensure that communication is clear and quick. As Alan will explain, we are preparing for significant volume growth in 2021. On slide nine, our six techniques that will help us get maximum leverage from additional traffic. Full pin is a technique used to optimally match train size with the pulling power of locomotives. While volume fluctuations can make this challenging, full pin drives fuel efficiency, controls crew starts and improves asset turns. Increasing the blending of different kinds of traffic on the same train supports full pin and minimizes additional train starts. We improve car velocity by blocking cars for the most distant possible destination, reducing yard costs by minimizing handlings. While we have reshaped the network through our four recent hump yard conversions, we are successfully minimizing hiring and training costs by helping furloughed employees in one craft transfer to another. This helps both the employee and Norfolk Southern. Those craft transfers are one way we are being more agile, flexing our resources up and down in sync with traffic volumes. We adapted the plan quickly through the pandemic and we continue to exercise that muscle memory. Finally, we are dynamically managing our operation to handle traffic fluctuations, keeping cars moving even when volume spikes. I am confident that we can meet customer expectations with our fast efficient network. With that, I will turn it over to Alan. Alan Shaw : Thank you, Cindy, and good morning, everyone. Headwinds related to COVID-19 and energy markets challenged volume in 2020, with revenue improving sequentially through the second half of the year. Throughout the recovery, we continued our focus, our project driven growth and margin improvement supported by our market approach and service product. As you can see on slide 11, the dual shock of the pandemic and declining energy markets pressured volumes in 2020. However, volume in both our intermodal and industrial markets excluding energy returned to growth during the fourth quarter as the economy continued its recovery from the pandemic. Turning to slide 12, full year 2020 revenue decreased 13% and total volume declined 12%. While our business capitalized on a V shaped recovery and consumer driven markets, year-over-year declines persisted in energy, which accounted for more than 70% of the 2020 revenue decline. Our continued commitment to margin improvement partially mitigated these impacts, resulting in RPU less fuel increases in all three business groups during each of the last four years. The mixed impact of increasing share of intermodal volume relative to decrease in energy volume resulted in the total RPU decline. Merchandise revenue fell 11%, with almost all markets experiencing pandemic-related losses. Notably, energy-related commodities faced supply and demand shocks, prompting high inventory levels and record low commodity prices. Most prominent in the second quarter, dramatic declines in manufacturing and vehicle production, placed downward pressure on steel prices and production for much of the year. Intermodal revenue recovered significantly in the second half of the year. However, first half losses resulted in a 6% revenue reduction and a 2% decline in revenue excluding fuel for the full year. E-commerce and consumer driven business supported the intermodal recovery, particularly in our premium segment. Secular declines in the coal industry accelerated during the pandemic, as cold revenue and volume dropped 37% in 2020 in the face of declining low demand, with product substitutes gaining market share. Utility volume fell sharply year-over-year due to sustained low natural gas prices, reduced industrial power demand and high stockpiles. Lower seaborne coal prices were a headwind entering 2020, which coupled with the onset of COVID-19 and import restrictions, led to challenge volumes, especially in the second and third quarters. While pandemic conditions negatively impacted revenue and volume in 2020, we maintained our focus on delivering a service product that enables our customers and Norfolk Southern to grow, as the dynamic transportation environment continues to strengthen. This approach supports our strategy of providing a truck competitive, consistent and reliable service product to our customers, allowing our customers to compete, while creating operating leverage for Norfolk Southern and adding value for our shareholders. Moving to slide 13, our fourth quarter revenue results improve sequentially and outperform normal seasonality, as the economic recovery gained momentum. Total revenue for the quarter was down 4% year-over-year, as energy declines outweighed the year-over-year growth in both intermodal and merchandise excluding its energy components. RPU declined reflecting lower fuel surcharge revenue and the negative mix effect of higher intermodal and lower coal volume. Within merchandise, both volume and revenue were down 5% year-over-year, driven by declines in crude oil and natural gas liquids. Crude oil shipments were heavily impacted by reduced global consumption due to COVID-19 leading to lower refinery run rates, significant storage worldwide and unfavorable price spreads. Shipments of natural gas liquids were also down significantly due to additional pipeline capacity, coupled with lower consumption. Partially offsetting these declines were gains in soybeans from increased opportunities for export, reflecting our long standing focus on margin improvement, merchandise quarterly revenue per unit less fuel increased year-over-year for the 23rd consecutive quarter. Intermodal business levels grew meaningfully year-over-year as we leveraged our powerful franchise to secure new opportunities from the surge in e-commerce activity, record tightness in the trucking sector and recovering global demand, excluding fuel fourth quarter revenue increased 11% year-over-year. Domestic shipments were up 7% year-over-year, propelled by more than 30% increase in premium shipments. Revenue per unit less fuel reached a record level in the fourth quarter, marking the 16th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Our coal franchise experienced continued declines, amid low energy prices in the fourth quarter. Thermal export volume increased, which was more than offset by a 40% decline in utility tons. Our utility franchise faced continued pressure from low natural gas prices, renewable generation and reduced manufacturing output. In total, coal volume fell 25% from the same period in 2019. Record level revenue per unit less fuel was driven by positive mix within our utility markets and volume shortfalls. Moving to our outlook on slide 14, we are closely monitoring economic developments and the attendant impacts on our franchise. Markets have not recovered equally. The consumer driven market recovered first and has exceeded pre-pandemic levels, while manufacturing markets have been slow to recover with existing social distancing protocols and labor force participation. Although, economic uncertainty persists, current trends support optimism for our business in the coming year, with an improving manufacturing sector and expected strength in consumer spending. With respect to the merchandise markets, we expect the steady recovery in manufacturing activity to support our customers\u2019 efforts to rebuild inventories and meet increasing demand. Total manufacturing activity is accelerating, driving opportunities across our merchandise segments. Supply chain disruptions and supplier shortages have further impacted inventory levels downward, creating an additional need for increased activity in the coming months. Prices for steel are up more than 80% year-over-year, which will lift production and trade activity. U.S. light vehicle production is expected to exceed 2019 levels by 3% in 2021, which will support automotive volume and adjacent markets like steel and plastics. Housing remains a growth story resulting in increases in construction activity. Growth in our agriculture and forest products segment will be led by agrofuels and food service related markets, as consumer gasoline demand returns and the service sector recovers, although most energy-related markets are expected to remain challenge. Projected strengthen consumer spending, low inventory levels, record tightness in the trucking industry and our best-in-class channel partners will continue to spur growth in our robust intermodal franchise. Good spending is forecasted derives 7% in 2021, due to continued pandemic induced spending patterns and high levels of personal savings, triggering increased demand for our intermodal product. Our outlook for coal remains pressured by high stockpiles that will lower utility volumes. Partially offsetting these declines will be export thermal and domestic met volumes projected to increase as the global recovery from COVID-19 continues into 2021. In summary, we expect 2021 revenue growth as overall economic conditions improved throughout the year. We\u2019re constantly adapting to the evolving needs of our customers, providing valued transportation solutions to the marketplace. We recognize that sustainable low carbon transportation is essential to our customers and our growth strategy. We remain committed to our efforts to improve fuel efficiency, modernize our fleet with energy management solutions and partner with our customers to prevent pollution. Our leadership and sustainability is resonating with our customers and the markets we serve validating these efforts. We\u2019re confident in our ability to leverage our value in the marketplace to secure new opportunities to support our customers\u2019 growth and grow our margins. I will now turn it over to Mark who will cover our financial results. Mark George : Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. On slide 16, you\u2019ll note Q4 2020 was free of any non-core items, meaning the OR improvement of 240 basis points was clean. We did in Q4 2019 report a non-operating asset impairment of $21 million. That adversely impacted EPS by $0.06 and a $19 million retroactive income tax credit that aided EPS by $0.07. So with the absence of those two items, core EPS improvement this quarter was $0.10. Moving to the fourth quarter highlights on slide 17. Revenue was down 4% on volume that was down 1% as mix and fuel surcharge headwinds continued. Against that 1% decline in volume we drove down operating expenses by 8% in the quarter as benefits from workforce and asset productivity continued to grow. As a result, operating income actually grew in the quarter by $22 million or 2% and the operating ratio improved to 61.8, a 240-basis-point improvement over Q4 of 2019. This is a record low OR for Norfolk Southern and we are well-positioned to continue driving this down in 2021 and beyond. The margin improvement achieved in the fourth quarter capped off a year in which free cash flow improved by 14% to $2.1 billion, another record for NS. Moving to a review of operating expenses on slide 18. Total OpEx was down $139 million or 8%, fuel was down 87 million with lower pump prices contributing to $62 million of that reduction and consumption was down $21 million led by fewer GTMs, as well as a 3% improvement in fuel efficiency in the quarter. Comp and benefits are down 7% led mainly by employment cost with the workforce down by 3,300 or 15%, $10 million in one-time separation costs for certain craft employees partially offset these savings. Purchase services was down $41 million or 11%, as we\u2019re making progress on the structural and semi-structural costs within this category, as well as due to the absence of detouring costs associated with flooding in the prior year. Depreciation increased modestly by less than 1%, as we\u2019ve been able to successfully reduce asset intensity, including within the locomotive fleet, which continues to have ample surge capacity to absorb growth. Materials were down 7% due to lower spend associated with a smaller and more productive locomotive fleet. Lastly, gains on the sales of operating property was $11 million in the quarter, a decline of $32 million versus the prior year. So another quarter of expense reductions far in excess of the volume decline, leaving us well primed to deliver strong operating leverage as 2021 unfolds. Now turning to slide 19, for the remainder of the fourth quarter P&L. Below the operating income, you\u2019ll see that other income net of $43 million is $25 million better than the prior year, due to the absence of the $21 million impairment of natural resource assets in Q4 2019. We also had another quarter of healthy gains on our company own life insurance investments. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was just under 23%, helped by the coal gains that are exempt from income taxes. Net income increased by 1% and EPS rose by 4%, as we ramped up share repurchases to nearly $500 million in the quarter. Now for a look at the full year on slide 20 and to preface I\u2019ll speak to the adjusted numbers on this slide, excluding the impacts of the two non-cash charges during the year, the $385 million locomotive rationalization and the $99 million investment impairment. Despite the unprecedented volatility in business volumes that resulted in a 13% decline in revenues, we maintained focus on our long-term operational transformation, while adapting to the market changes that were induced by the global pandemic, as well as the contracting energy markets. In the midst of this, we produce record workforce productivity, locomotive productivity and fuel efficiency, which allowed us to more than match the revenue decline with a 14% reduction in adjusted operating expenses, while ensuring we are ready to serve improving freight demand as the economy recovers. The adjusted operating ratio posted improvement to 64.4%, the fifth consecutive year of improvement. But there\u2019s more under the covers when we look at the 30-basis-point improvement for the year. Moving now to slide 21, you can see during the second quarter of 2020, the 29% hit to revenue on a year-over-year basis took a toll on the operating ratio, but every other quarter of the year, improved in the 230-basis-point to 240-basis-point range. Throughout the year and especially during the depths of the pandemic induced volume trough, the team really pressed forward to adapt our operating plan to the changing business environment. In fact, two of the four hump idling during the year occurred within Q2 and when the nationwide automotive network shut down, we completely redesigned our auto plan to absorb it into existing trains. In addition, we continue to press lower on resources and ensure that we were able to serve a surge in demand as economic activity increased, which is exactly what happened. We maintained a heightened sense of urgency to transform the business, while ensuring we are positioned for long term success and further margin improvement. Moving on to cash flow on slide 22, although 2020 cash from operations came in under the 2019 levels, spend on property additions for the year was right in line with the reduced target we set earlier in the year of $1.5 billion, which was a 26% reduction from 2019 levels. We pivoted early in the year to this reduced CapEx target at the outset of the pandemic and executed the plan, while keeping priority on the health of the physical network. Thanks to these tight controls on both capital and operating expenses, free cash flow improved to a record $2.1 billion, while shareholder distributions total $2.4 billion. Average share count declined by 3%, with over 1.4 billion of buybacks as we maintain tight focus on returning capital to shareholders, while maintaining strong liquidity. To close, we have excellent momentum on improving both our cost and asset structures while we deliver on the growth in 2021. We expect this formula to yield even greater margins and cash flow and we remain committed to delivering significant returns for our shareholders. With that, I\u2019ll hand back over to Jim. Jim Squires : Thank you, Mark. Turning to slide 24, I will wrap up with our 2021 expectations. As you heard from Alan, we expect segments related to manufacturing and consumer activity to drive growth, while energy-related commodities are likely to remain challenged. We are modeling total revenues up approximately 9%, with intermodal leading the way, merchandise growing solidly and coal declining. The power of our intermodal and merchandise segments to propel us to growth despite the secular decline in coal highlights the continuity of our strategy over time. As we move ahead, we will leverage many avenues to drive long-term volume and revenue growth, including a fast and reliable service product, the advancement of technology initiatives such as Access NS and Rail Pulse, just to name a couple, and our steadfast commitment to being a sustainable and socially responsible corporate citizen. With this positive momentum, we expect to achieve greater than 300 basis points of OR improvement in 2021 versus our adjusted 2020 results and to end 2021 with a full year run rate of 60%. As we have said before, when we achieve our targets, we won\u2019t stop there. In addition, we expect capital expenditures to approximate $1.6 billion, with a dividend payout ratio of 35% to 40%, an increase versus our prior target payout ratio of one-third. As we demonstrated in 2020, we are committed to protecting liquidity, while using remaining cash flow and financial leverage to repurchase shares. We are optimistic about growth in the year ahead and we will advance productivity initiatives to bring freight onto the railroad more profitably than ever. We know there is more improvement to be made across the organization and we\u2019ll continue executing on our commitments to drive efficiencies and create long-term sustained value for our shareholders. Thank you for your attention. We\u2019ll now open the line for Q&A. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Brian Ossenbeck : Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just one for, Cindy, on just the service levels. You mentioned, they had some challenges when you\u2019re doing the redesign in the fourth quarter, but you expect them to improve. Maybe you can give us some level of confidence as to how you\u2019re applying some of the resources tactically across the network? What sort of issues you\u2019ve had to face and just how you feel about hiring in the pipeline as you start to get ready for this type of growth in 2021? Cindy Sanborn : Hey. Brian, thanks for the question. So, as we went into the fourth quarter with some of our operational changes, our Southeast plan, I also referenced in my prepared remarks, some organizational changes that we made. And in fact, we did reduce our locomotive fleet by about 100 locomotives during the quarter. So as we digested a lot of those challenges, we were starting to run a little slower, and we did in fact, inject a little bit of support from a resource perspective in temporarily. I would also add that as we were recovering from some of the challenges that I described, we did have some COVID impacts with some of our employees out as part of the COVID protocols and also don\u2019t feel as individuals. So that was how we were -- kind of how I would diagnose the fourth quarter. As we come out of the fourth quarter running through the holidays to get back on our feet, we\u2019ve gotten a lot better. We\u2019re not at 2020 levels, but we are much, much better. We are continuing to tweak and take resources out in terms of consolidating train. So we still have opportunities to digest changes within the network. But as necessary, we will inject a resource -- some resources into make sure that we recover quickly from challenges that we may have. From thinking about the volume that we\u2019re seeing, I think, some of it is in unit train and that will require resource use a little bit different than our scheduled network. But I will tell you that in our scheduled network, we still have a lot of opportunity to consolidate trains, make them longer and make them heavier, even on top of the gains that we made in the fourth quarter. And I can tell you that, even in our intermodal fleet, for example, our intermodal train operation, we\u2019ve got about 10% of our trains are operating over 10,000 feet. So we still have some opportunity to grow in that space and that should help us manage our headcount in this year to flat to down from where we exited \u201820 -- December of 2020. So I\u2019m pretty confident we will continue to make some gains there and also our locomotive fleet. Brian Ossenbeck : Great. Thanks Cindy for all the details there. Maybe one for, Mark, looking at the gains, I think, you says about $11 million in the quarter? Looking at the cash flow, I think, it implies something a little bit higher than that, just looking at the gain on disposal. So maybe you can clear that up for me? And then just give us a sense as to what you\u2019re expecting for gains in 2021, when you look at that 300 basis points of OR improvement. Mark George : Yeah. The property gains, Brian, were in the quarter -- the fourth quarter were $11 million. We ended up the year at really $26 million of gains, a little shy of where we had intended or thought. And the guidance for 2021 is to be in that $30 million to $40 million range. But these property gains are lumpy and they can move around and we\u2019ll provide some transparency. And if we have bigger ones in a given quarter, we\u2019ll call them out and let you know. Brian Ossenbeck : Got it. Thank you, Mark. Mark George : Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your questions? Scott Group : Hey. Thanks. Good morning, guys. So, Alan, I want to start with you, on the 9% revenue growth. Can you give us directionally how much is volume versus RPU? And then in the fourth quarter coal RPU was really strong, was there any liquidated damages or is that just a mix? I\u2019m just trying to understand if that\u2019s sustainable or not? Alan Shaw : Scott, as we look into \u201821, we are projecting very strong growth in both our intermodal and automotive markets, as well as our merchandise ex energy. We expect energy revenues to remain about flat. They accounted for about 75% of our revenue decline in the -- in 2020. So we\u2019re not going to have that headwind, which is going to uncover the growth in the other markets. And we\u2019re targeting 9% revenue growth, upper single-digit volume growth. So martis -- modest, pardon me, RPU growth, just because of the mix impact of intermodal leading the way. With respect to coal, I mean, you are -- you got it right. We did have about $12 million of incremental year-over-year in volume shortfall, which aided the RPU. We also had positive mix within our utility franchise in which our utility North volume, which as you know was shorter haul was down about 50% and our utility South volume was down about 30%. And then we also got some good pricing too in some of our markets as well. So all that rolls up into the overall RPU improvement that you saw within coal. Scott Group : Okay. Helpful. And then, Mark, for you on the cost side, so it sounds like full year headcount is going to be down a couple percent, but maybe help us think about some of the other pieces on the cost side. I know comp per employee, purchase services, depreciation, any other big items you can help us with? Thank you. Mark George : Scott, are you referring to 2021? Scott Group : Yes. Mark George : Or 2020? Scott Group : \u201821, just in terms of\u2026 Mark George : Yeah. Scott Group : \u2026some of the guidance you could give us on comp per employee, purchase services, any of the other pieces? Mark George : Right. So for cost per employee, you can expect the traditional year-over-year inflationary rate increases of a few percent, but you\u2019re going to also have some incentive headwinds as well. Clearly, we didn\u2019t pay out on incentive compensation at target this year. We fully expect to be at or above target next year. So you\u2019ll have pressures there. In addition, you\u2019re going to have some pressures on certain variable costs, like purchase services, and as Alan says [ph], those go with volume. And we are, though, however, pushing on efficiency and productivity to help mitigate some of those things. Jim Squires : Depreciation. Scott Group : Is there any way to just say what the headwind would be from incentive comp, just going from a partial payout to a full payout? Mark George : I\u2019m not going to put a finer point on that just yet, Scott. But you can probably compute that, this year incentive comp was down and we expect that that is going to bounce back and hopefully bounce back significantly. But we\u2019ll provide a little bit more guidance on that as we get into the year and we start to see how the trends are going. Scott Group : Okay. Thank you, guys. Mark George : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your questions. Bascome Majors : Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to go back to some of the merchandise markets where the outlook is pretty constructive outside of energy. We get steel prices through the roof. You mentioned auto. But could you talk with what you\u2019re hearing from your customers? I mean, are there discrete items where you have plants reopening, utilization rising? Like how much visibility do you have into this turning into a real sequential volume acceleration versus just seeing some of the indicators in a very different backdrop from what we saw in the first six months of last year? Thank you. Jim Squires : Yeah. Bascome, I think we\u2019ve got pretty good visibility into this, at least for the next couple quarters. You saw our merchandise ex energy rotating the growth year-over-year during the fourth quarter. So -- and we\u2019re continuing with that level of momentum. As you\u2019ve noted, steel prices are at like 12-year highs, right? And so our customers are talking about adding back capacity. The corn market, or I should say, the corn, wheat and soybean market, that -- those commodity prices are about six-year highs and then the housing market is about as strong as it\u2019s been in 14 years. And so, you couple that with the fact that wholesale inventory levels are close to two-year lows and there\u2019s a lot of demand for our product out there. Even in the paper market, those who make corrugated cardboard, they\u2019re sold out because of the proliferation of e-commerce. And so across the Board, we\u2019re seeing strength in our merchandise network, which gives us a lot of confidence as we move into \u201821. Bascome Majors : And as that grows, should we expect the traditional relationship, where you\u2019re able to add cars to existing trains or have some of the\u2026 Jim Squires : Yeah. Bascome Majors : \u2026train link gains that you\u2019ve made may be limited that normal kind of cyclical calculus that we\u2019re used to? Jim Squires : No. You\u2019re exactly right. We\u2019ve -- Cindy highlighted that a little bit. We\u2019ve got capacity for growth, since most of our growth is going to be oriented towards consumer and manufacturer, and that\u2019s generally carloads, small block shipments and that\u2019s going to fit neatly into existing intermodal and merchandise trains. Now just the data point, within our intermodal franchise, we\u2019ve really been working on our productivity and train weight has improved year-over-year about 900 basis points more than train length. And so right there, you can visualize kind of vertical stacking of and creating more revenue density, improving productivity of crews and fuel and locomotives. Bascome Majors : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions. Amit Mehrotra : Thanks, Operator. Good morning, everybody. Congrats on the results. Alan, I guess, the first one for you. If we look back at 2020 and compare the volume performance to your closest competitor, there was significant volume underperformance. And this is not a critical question. It\u2019s more of -- I am just trying to understand what\u2019s behind that, specifically as it relates to merchandise. Sorry, I think I got disconnect. Alan Shaw : Yeah. Amit. Amit Mehrotra : Yeah. Alan Shaw : I\u2019m sorry\u2026 Amit Mehrotra : Can you hear me now? Alan Shaw : I missed the last part of your question. Amit Mehrotra : Yeah. Yeah, I\u2019m just trying to understand, CSX has a lower cost structure, for now at least. I\u2019m just trying to understand is the volume underperformance relative to CSX over the course of 2020, specifically, in merchandise? Is that a pure market share shift or are there -- is there something beneath the numbers that maybe explains it better and if you can also talk about how you expect that relative performance to trend over 2021? Alan Shaw : Yeah. Amit, we talked about this a lot last year. We are fierce competitors. We\u2019re going to go out there and we\u2019re going to compete for every pound of business that\u2019s available to us, both with our eastern rail competitor and within that $800 billion trucking logistics market. We\u2019ve got a lot of confidence in our franchise. We have got a lot of confidence in our customers. And you can take a look at revenue per revenue ton mile comps and you can see, our focus really is on helping our customers grow and margin improvement. Specific to merchandise, as I -- let\u2019s say that the year-over-year gap between us and our eastern rail competitor was about 550 basis points in the fourth quarter, 400 basis points of that was just an energy, 400 basis points. So that\u2019s over 80% of it. I talked about, as we lead into the fourth quarter that we were about to run up against the most difficult comp of the year with respect to crude oil and that certainly played out. And so, those energy headwinds that we saw last year, which defined about close to three quarters of our overall revenue decline, are not something that we expect to see this year. We\u2019re not calling for growth there. And if that does happen, we\u2019re well-positioned to handle it and to profit from it. And we are seeing some signs there that commodity prices are strengthening and thermal coal is in pretty high demand in the worldwide market. But we\u2019re not expecting that level of headwind this year, which is why we really believe we\u2019re going to rotate into pretty strong growth led by our intermodal and our merchandise ex energy franchise. Amit Mehrotra : Great. Okay. That\u2019s really helpful and encouraging. I -- my second follow up, I guess, for Cindy or Mark, when I look at the guidance, it implies kind of mid-to-high 70% incremental margins, which is a really nice number. I guess, if you just break it down in terms of dollar cadence, you\u2019re basically projecting a $900 million increase in revenue and like a $200 million increase in expenses, which is a very good performance? And I think it\u2019d be helpful to, I guess, Cindy or Mark, just talk about your confidence level in terms of being able to achieve that? How much relies on price and how much relies on just blocking and tackling and be able to control the cost structure and just your overall confidence to be able to achieve that? Mark George : Sure. Amit, I will start. Cindy can provide some color. But, yeah, look, the cost inflation as I had mentioned, we\u2019re going to be fighting some traditional inflation in terms of wages. But we are looking to really hold headcount flat or perhaps even drift down from where we ended this year. And that\u2019s largely going to be dependent upon where this incremental volume comes is to how aggressive we can get on constricting some of those headcount related costs. But we\u2019ve -- we feel pretty good and pretty confident with our plan to manage it that way and mitigate some of the wage inflation. We do have fuel inflation in our cost as well, as well as you have normal step up in depreciation. But other areas where we\u2019re baking in some efficiency and productivity gains in multiple levels in the P&L, and I think, we feel like, Cindy, had talked about, we have the capacity. We can make our trains longer. Yes, when we have unit train type of traffic, we\u2019re going to have to add some crews and costs. But aside from that, Cindy, would you add anything? Cindy Sanborn : No. I think that sums it up very, very well. And I think what -- while we\u2019re very encouraged by the growth and we want to serve our customers and have a great sort of service product out here, if it doesn\u2019t come, we\u2019re going to take appropriate action. So we have a lot of opportunity, even with absorb existing growth and continue to consolidate trains and consolidate cars. Just focus on our car velocity initiative, but we will pivot if we need to pivot. So team is -- we got a lot of momentum here. If you look at the results coming out fourth quarter and the first, a lot of momentum and we will drive hump. Amit Mehrotra : Great. Okay. Thanks very much, everybody. Good luck. Appreciate it. Jim Squires : Thanks, Amit. Operator : The next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions. Walter Spracklin : Thanks for taking my question. Good morning, everyone. So I just thought\u2026 Jim Squires : Good morning. Walter Spracklin : Yeah. Yeah. Just starting on some of the more administrative, the other income line that you flagged, can you -- that\u2019s jumped around quite a bit quarter-to-quarter. It had an impact in the last couple quarters as well. Can you give us some guidance as to what to expect on a general base level quarter -- on a quarterly basis in that other income line going forward? Mark George : Thank you, Walter, for the question. So, look, the main driver of volatility in that line is our -- the returns on our company own life insurance investments, which are invested in a combination of both equities and fixed incomes. So it does move around quite a bit, depending on market performance and that\u2019s why you see the volatility you see. We\u2019ve guided historically that other income would be in that $80 million to $100 million range. But, frankly, it will move around quarter-to-quarter. And if markets deteriorate, it\u2019s going to be a potential headwind for us. But we\u2019ve enjoyed a pretty good healthy gains here these past couple years. Walter Spracklin : Yeah. Absolutely. And you were guiding historically for 23% to 24% tax. You\u2019ve had a good run with lower taxes this year. What would be your expectation on the tax rate for \u201821? Mark George : Yeah. So you\u2019re right, we guide to 23%, 24%. We\u2019re not going to change that guidance right now. We know that there\u2019s tax law being debated and whether the federal statutory rate moves up to 28%, which is what the current administration is aiming for. We don\u2019t know the timing. We don\u2019t know if there\u2019ll be some compromise at a lower rate. But our better performance than the guide, it\u2019s really driven by in large part the company own life insurances, those gains are non-tax. So that definitely provides us tailwind, which is why we\u2019ve been better past couple of years than the guided rate. We\u2019re not going to bake that in and anticipate more tailwind from that here in 2021. So we\u2019re going to stick with our guide of 23% to 24%. Thanks, Walter. Operator : Our next question comes from line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please proceed with your questions. Cherilyn Radbourne : Thanks very much and good morning. I\u2019ll just stick to one here. There\u2019s certainly been a lot of talk across the industry about congestion in LA, Long Beach and in Chicago as a result of the import surge that we\u2019ve seen. Is there having a collateral impact on Norfolk Southern and if so how are you working with shippers and your rail partners to alleviate that congestion? Jim Squires : Thanks, Cherilyn. Good morning. They -- the congestion out on the West Coast ports has limited the Transcon volume that we enjoy. And it\u2019s also caused some of our channel partners to allocate more assets out there, which limits upside in the East. And then with respect to Chicago, all of the congestion that we\u2019re seeing in Chicago is largely outside of our intermodal gates and that\u2019s with the drayage community and with warehouses as they go through pandemic protocols and regularly have difficulty getting people to work because of COVID concerns. And so that -- what that does share on is it slows down the turn of the assets, the chassis and the boxes, which can limit upside volume as well. So we\u2019re communicating really closely with our channel partners. We have got -- we\u2019re aligned with the best in the business and they\u2019re really good at what they do. And so we\u2019re working on solutions collaboratively in order to mitigate these impacts. And as a result, you saw that our intermodal revenue ex-fuel was up 11% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Cherilyn Radbourne : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Allison Landry : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. So, just clarified on the 60 run rate by the end of the year, I mean, is this how we should think about Q4 or would you expect that to be more of a second half run rate? And then if you could comment on your expectations for the Q1 OR with some of the other relative been a bit cautious on both year-over-year improvement and are also pointing few sequential degeneration that\u2019s a bit worse than normal. So is that a fair way to think about Q1 and then just if you could clarify on the run rate for the 60? Mark George : Allison, this is Mark. Thanks for the question. We\u2019re not going to get into the quarterly guidance for Q1. Volume will play a role. Obviously, volume has started strong here. But as you know Q1 typically is the highest OR quarter that we do have. There are some seasonal cost reasons for that, whether or not -- I would expect from a year-over-year perspective, we will show improvement each quarter. But sequentially, I\u2019m not going to get into that yet until we understand where volumes fall out. With regard to the timing of the year, it will also depend on the cadence of the volume throughout the year. I would expect to be on a glide path for that 60 and it\u2019s too early to say again, what quarter we\u2019re going to touch it. Allison Landry : Okay. That helps. And then maybe, Mark, I guess, another one for you. Maybe if you could just give us your thoughts on leverage and what you\u2019re targeting for 2021? Mark George : Sure, Allison. So we\u2019re basically staying fully committed to our BBB+, Baa1 credit rating with Moody\u2019s. So we\u2019re going to manage leverage in the course of the year accordingly to make sure that we work towards staying in balance and stay committed again to our current rating. So I\u2019m not going to put an exact number of what that means in terms of incremental debt or necessarily deleveraging, but just know that we\u2019re committed to be within the balance. Allison Landry : Okay. Great. Thank you, guys. Mark George : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of David Ross with Stifel. Please proceed with your questions. David Ross : Yes. Good morning, everyone. Having a conversation with somebody in the industry the other day, who said that intermodal and PSR in his mind were incompatible, because intermodal is about accommodating and balances and surges, and PSR\u2019s goal is really to eliminate them. How do you think about intermodal and then your PSR goals, and is there friction there? Jim Squires : Strongly disagree with that characterization of PSR is applied to an intermodal franchise. We believe that and we have applied PSR principles to our intermodal network and we\u2019ll continue to do so, while maintaining intermodal as a growth engine. Cindy? Cindy Sanborn : Yeah. I would say that, PSR is really about simplifying things and having very good asset terms. That can be done in any class of business you want to think about. And absorbing volume growth into existing schedule trains, mixing trains so that we in case some cases while you will see some intermodal in the train, you\u2019ll also see manifest and other commodities. So, all of those are levers that you naturally pull with PSR and are completely compatible with any kind of business that we might be able to bring onto the rail. Mark George : David our intermodal franchise as you know is unrivaled in the East. It\u2019s a position of strength for us and for our shareholders and for our channel partners. PSR is about reducing complexity and running the trains on time, which is exactly what you want in an intermodal network. And we already have a point-to-point intermodal network with a lot -- with very little intermediate switching. We are very focused on our productivity initiatives within intermodal to drive additional business into the existing train structure and I noted earlier the fact that our train weight increases about 900 basis points above our train length increase. And so what that does is -- what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re just adding that additional business into the existing trains and improving our ability to double stack. David Ross : Yeah. And just as a quick follow up on that related to double stacking, are there any corridors left in the network, were that\u2019s a problem and you can\u2019t take advantage of the double stack capabilities? Mark George : We are double stack capable and well over 95% of our launch [ph] segments. David Ross : Excellent. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please proceed with your questions. Chris Wetherbee : Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Alan, maybe sticking on the intermodal outlook for a moment here, I guess you guys have done a pretty good job improving the yields on that business ex-fuel over the last several years -- three years I guess in particular. When you look at \u201821, how do you sort of balance the approach, obviously, truckloads going to have a very good year from a pricing standpoint? There obviously is some read across the intermodal as a result of that. Are you going to be leaning in a little bit more on the volume side or is it still going to be a balance where you\u2019re looking to get more price out of the franchise? Alan Shaw : Chris, we\u2019re going to continue our balanced approach. We\u2019ve got long-term deals with our channel partners and we\u2019ve frankly take a long-term approach to the markets. We do not want to interject the volatility associated with the spot market into our intermodal rate base. We do have a small percentage of business that\u2019s transactional and we\u2019re adjusting our rate plan there. But for the large part we\u2019re taking measured rate increases and then you saw our rate increases benefit from that in 2019, in the first half of 2020 when we were in a fray recession. Over time what that means is that our rates are moving at a pace that\u2019s higher than changes in the spot market and a little bit higher than what\u2019s going on in the contract market. So as a result, you should not see -- expect to see any kind of significant in -- rate increase in 2021, because frankly overall contract rates were slightly down in the truck market in 2020. It\u2019ll support for the rate improvements in 2022. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. Got it. That\u2019s helpful. I appreciate it. And then a quick follow-up on CapEx, obviously guiding down to around 15% of revenue, I think, thinking back to the sort of launch of PSR in the Investor Day. I think the guidance was maybe a little bit higher than that over the longer run. So maybe trying to think about how -- what has changed since then and maybe if this is more of a sustainable kind of run rate when you think about it as a percent of revenue or maybe that\u2019s not the right way to about it, but just any sort of thoughts on CapEx because it\u2019s obviously just come down and that\u2019s going to be a boost to free cash? Mark George : Yeah. Thanks. We\u2019ve took our CapEx down at a significant readjusted baseline level of $1.5 billion this past year. And we\u2019ve talked throughout the year about the fact that we want to grow it modestly from here and really like to see revenue out -- revenue growth outpaced the growth in CapEx. That means growing into a smaller percentage then so be it and certainly that\u2019s where the math equates to this year is that we will grow into a smaller percentage. We want to do CapEx and budget CapEx based on logic and need not just based on revenue based affordability for example. But that said, we put this budget together and if Alex come, I am sorry, if Alan comes in and says we\u2019ve got these certain projects we need to help drive growth. We will examine it. If Cindy comes and says, we got some work to do on siding expansions or to augment the network a little bit more from a maintenance away perspective, we\u2019ll examine it. So we\u2019re not going to be dogmatic and I would like to kind of bury the 16% to 18% range from here. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. That\u2019s helpful color. I appreciate the time. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Brandon Oglenski : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Cindy, I guess, I wanted to come back to the beginning of the call here. Did you explicitly say that headcount could actually be down in 2021? And I guess it just wanted to balance that against the comments that you\u2019ve had with bringing back some unit train service and need for crews. Can you just maybe hash that out a little bit more? Cindy Sanborn : Yeah. So guidance would be flat-to-down from where we ended 2020. So -- but -- and to your point, some of the odd -- some of the reason we would need to keep it flat would be the unit trains. So what that implies is that we\u2019re still consolidating and still figuring ways to make our schedule network much more efficient and absorb the growth and provide a very solid service product for our customers. So that\u2019s our mission going forward. We\u2019re actively in it now and have been. And I\u2019m very pleased with the momentum that we have there and going forward I think we\u2019ll see good results from it. Brandon Oglenski : Okay. And I don\u2019t mean to be pesky here and I know it\u2019s been a long call. But on the first quarter you did say something about bringing back temporary resources. Is that going to have any impact on those metrics in the near-term that we need to be aware of? Cindy Sanborn : Yeah. When I spoke about that, it was really about recovering from some of the challenges that we faced in the fourth quarter, including some COVID impacted crew districts, where we had to move some temporary in from a headcount perspective. Those were back out now. And then, secondly, we had reduced locomotives in the quarter and some of the challenges that we had at the very end, we injected those for a very temporary period of time and have since pulled those out. So, what I was talking about earlier in my commentary was really around the fourth quarter. Brandon Oglenski : Got it. All right. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Jon Chapell with Evercore. Please proceed with your questions. Jon Chapell : Thank you. A couple for Alan. First on coal, so you said in your outlook slide, you expect coal to decline this year, which from a secular standpoint, I don\u2019t think anyone would argue with that premise. However, the comps are so easy from the middle of this year of the precipitous declines you saw especially in second quarter? You\u2019ve seen sequential volume increases as you\u2019ve gone through the year and come out of the pandemic. The RPU increases exiting 2020 and even your through a couple of weeks of 2021, the carload comparisons don\u2019t look that bad. So just -- I understand that coals in decline forever, but is there a reason why you couldn\u2019t just see a reprieve in 2021 given those factors I just addressed? Alan Shaw : Hey, John. I hope you\u2019re right. I think the thing that gives me the largest pause is the status of stockpiles at utility plants. They\u2019re at across our system. The publicly available numbers show they\u2019re pretty close to about 130 days. And so that is really going to limit volumes for us. That\u2019s about 40% higher than they were this time last year. So that\u2019s a headwind, right? And if -- they need manufacturing engineers, commercial businesses reopened to start creating that load for the utilities as well and natural gas seems to be stuck in the mid-twos per million BTUs. So that\u2019s an issue too. So those are all headwinds. But as we talked about it -- this -- if it returns, that\u2019s great, we\u2019re ready and we\u2019ve got a really good coal franchise. And I do think there is some upside in thermal export coal, but we\u2019re not planning on it and we\u2019re not baking it into our outlook. That\u2019s upside. Jon Chapell : Okay. Understood. And then shifting to auto, you guys have had a really strong start to the year, really real strong last several months. We\u2019re hearing some issues with chip shortages, potential near-term production issues. Obviously, you have a bit of a unique franchise there. Are you hearing any concerns from your customers about potential near-term shutdowns because of some of these equipment shortages? Alan Shaw : Yeah. We\u2019ve got a great auto team and they\u2019ve done a very good job of building that franchise for us. Yeah, there are supply disruptions and basically many of the markets, if not all of the markets that we serve, semiconductors that you referenced is something that we\u2019ve heard of as well. Although, generally the automakers are allocating the scarce resources to the SUVs and trucks and vans, which is predominantly what we handle in our bi-level product. But the auto volume will be upside for us this year. Jon Chapell : Okay. Great. Thanks a lot, Alan. Operator : The next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. David Vernon : Hey. Good morning, guys. So one thing that always stands out in terms of talking to the intermodal market and the railroads, the rails are talking about advancing service levels with intermodal and a lot of the channel partners are frustrated with the handoffs at the terminals and things like that. If you think about your outlook for volume growth, do you get concerned at all that the channel and the terminal network is going to be able to handle that sort of mid-to-high single-digit volume growth in the intermodal segment? And how do you -- how are you set up to kind of handle that? It seems like over the last peak season we certainly saw some congestion in -- across the intermodal network? Alan Shaw : David, good question. We talked about that briefly before where the drayage community slowed down in the processing of the warehousing has impacted street dwell and turns of equipment chassis and containers, and that is limiting the upside. However, even with that, we still delivered 11% year-over-year revenue growth in the fourth quarter ex-fuel surcharge. And you can see that our volumes within our intermodal franchise to start the year are up double-digit. So we\u2019ve got a great franchise, we\u2019ve got great channel partners. Again, they\u2019re very good at what they do and managing complex supply chains. So we\u2019re going to work with them on this. We\u2019re delivering that level of growth with our intermodal franchise now. David Vernon : But -- I mean, I guess, is there anything you can do to advance the efficiency of that handoff operation? Do you need to think about that difference or that the way you\u2019re interacting with channels differently just to kind of unlock some additional growth potential or was it going to be just more kind of working with them status quo? Do you -- I mean, I guess, I\u2019m just trying to figure out like how do you unlock the potential that could be in that intermodal business, if this\u2026 Alan Shaw : Yeah. It is -- it really is about improve -- I am sorry, it\u2019s about improving the transparency and the visibility of what we\u2019re seeing and the assets that we share. And then it\u2019s about channel partners working with their BCS and the warehousing not getting in the chassis back into the gate. David Vernon : All right. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen. Please proceed with your questions. Jason Seidl : Thanks, Operator. Good morning, everyone. Cindy, you talked a lot about taking some structural costs out of the network in 2020. As you look at 2021 and beyond, are there any structural costs left in your opinion and if there are, when do you think you guys can address them? Cindy Sanborn : Yeah. Jason, so we talked about some of our terminal consolidations and hump conversions that have occurred over the last couple of years. You\u2019ve seen us work very, very strongly prior to my arriving in that area. We have four actual humps left operating as hump yards. And so, we will continue to look at yards and see how we can speed up cars, the real mission around a terminal capability and terminal footprint is around keeping cars moving or not pushing cars into terminals, moving cars past terminal. So I think there is still some room there, quite a bit of room, but you\u2019ve seen us pivot now a little bit more into looking at our train length and locomotive utilization with full pin. And that\u2019s going to -- that\u2019s really our primary focus now. But we will always circle back and find opportunities to get the most out of our network and speed up cars and terminals are one of the methods that we use to do that. So there is always opportunity. And as we think about growth and we see the growth that we\u2019re having in 2021, it probably will look a little different than maybe what we would have thought in 2020. So we have to be very agile in looking at opportunities and we will continue to do that. So I don\u2019t have a specific number for you, Jason, but understand it is, we\u2019re really never done with looking at structural costs and we\u2019ll pull that out every opportunity we can find. Jason Seidl : Well, thanks. That\u2019s helpful. Follow-up here, Alan, you talked a little bit about intermodal RPU. I just want to make sure I understand what you said. You said that really don\u2019t look for too much this year in terms of gains, but it\u2019s going to be more of 2022. Is that how we should think about it? Alan Shaw : Yeah. They -- I talked about the arc of the improvements, Jason, and the fact that we didn\u2019t reflect the reduction in spot prices over the 18-month period in 2019 and the first half of 2020. Overall contract rates were -- in the truck market on average were, I think, flat or down slightly in 2020. And so we are just -- we take a long-term approaches, because I don\u2019t want to interject that level of volatility. And so our rate structure or our customers, our channel partners rates structure either, right? And they need something that they can plan on ahead of time. So, the truck market continues to improve and rate contract rates actually improve this year, go up, which we think they will, then that would be reflected in improvements in the 2022 rate structure. Jason Seidl : So, Alan, how should we think about the cadence of your intermodal contracts or contractual pricing renewals, like, when did the bulk of them renew? Alan Shaw : Well, I told you, I\u2019ve mentioned Jason that, we\u2019ve got long-term deals with our contract -- with our channel partners. Jason Seidl : Okay. Perfect. Appreciate for the help, Alan. Alan Shaw : Does that help? Okay. Thank you. Jason Seidl : Take care. Operator : The next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Ravi Shanker : Thanks. I just wanted to follow-up on that last point, because I think that\u2019s a little bit of a surprise because I think most people do expect the rails to be at least sort of ordered of beneficiaries of truck pricing tightness. Is this a new philosophy or was this the same approach that you guys had back in 2018 as well? I\u2019m just trying to figure out if it\u2019s just a case of we were saying the same thing, but in terms of different magnitudes? I mean, can you give us a ballpark of what we can expect 2021 and 2022 intermodal pricing to increase like that? Jim Squires : Yeah. Ravi, let me be clear. We are going to benefit from the tight truck market and you\u2019re going to see that both in volume and in intermodal and in merchandise. We have got -- we\u2019re looking at really healthy growth in our merchandise ex energy and in our intermodal volumes this year. What I\u2019ve talked about is our long-term approach to markets and this is something that we\u2019ve employed for years within our intermodal franchise and it\u2019s -- we don\u2019t want that level of volatility associated with the spot market into our rate structure. We do have a small portion of our intermodal business that\u2019s transactional and we are reassessing our rate plan to the positive there. However, for most of it, it\u2019s the rate increases unwind over time. And as a result, what you see is over time, less volatility and yet our price and intermodal exceeds the spot market and so that really exceeds the contract market. Recall, I mean, contract rates were flat or slightly down on the truck market in 2020. We took rate increases and we\u2019ve got 16 consecutive quarters of RPU less fuel improvements and -- in our intermodal franchise in 23 consecutive quarters and our merchandise franchise. So we take a measured approach to this. Ravi Shanker : Got it. And maybe as a follow-up for Cindy, can you just give us an update on how you\u2019re thinking about deploying technology and automation across the network in the next year or three? Again, you\u2019ve seen some of your peers start to commercialize things like automated transection portals, where you guys are with respect to rolling technologies that are out the network. Cindy Sanborn : Yeah. Ravi, we are doing the exact same things. Really we do have plans around the inspection portals, automated train inspection or truck inspection, excuse me, as well as mobility tools to help our employees be more effective and efficient and more time on tool if you will, as well as think of analytics to help us manage through failures before they become failures and not have to wait for a failure in terms of let\u2019s say a switch failure or something on line road be able to predict that. So we\u2019ve got a number of great projects that are in flight and we\u2019re working very closely with our technology team here to get quick adoption and make our railroad safer and more efficient with the use of technology. Ravi Shanker : Very good. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Justin Long : Thanks and good morning. I wanted to ask about truckload conversions and the network, any commentary around the trend you\u2019re seeing there in the fourth quarter and early part of this year. And as we think about the 2021 guidance, what has baked in from a conversion standpoint is, are you just making in-market assumptions and truckload convergence would be upside to that or can you just help us think through that? Jim Squires : Yeah. Good morning, Justin. So I think one way to think about our revenue growth in 2021, it\u2019s 9%, right? And so I\u2019ve talked about how energy, which is pretty close to about 20% of our revenue base is going to be flat. So you can envision that and the rest of our market, which is generally the more truck competitive we are seeing above 9% revenue growth and that\u2019s above macro. And so with that implicit in that is the fact that we are going to continue to target that $800 billion truck and logistics market, and leverage the strength of our franchise, which includes intermodal network and the fact that we\u2019ve got a diverse merchandise network and we sit on top of a majority of the consumption and the manufacturing in the United States. Justin Long : Okay. And then for my second question, just a quick follow-up on coal RPU, Alan, I think you walked through some of the mixed dynamics in the fourth quarter? But as we think about 2021, is your expectation that coal RPU is relatively flat sequentially with where we ended the year last year or can you help us think through that as well? Alan Shaw : Yeah. I would anticipate it\u2019s going to decline. It\u2019s -- we had a record RPU within our coal franchise in the fourth quarter. We\u2019re not calling for that. I noted that our utility South franchise, Justin you know, is a longer length of haul and generally as higher rates than utility North -- outperformed utility North. And so as a result, typically we talk in terms of a 50-50 mix between those two franchises and in the fourth quarter was about 60% utility South and 40% utility North. I anticipate that will go back the 50-50 moving forward. And as we\u2019ve talked about, Justin, the upside really is in that export thermal market, which has a shorter length of haul than the export met market and so that has a mix impact as well. Justin Long : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I appreciate the time. Operator : Thank you. Our final question today is coming from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions. Jordan Alliger : Yeah. Hi. I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re actually referenced this directly, but on the revenue per carload. I know you talked about some individual commodities, coal, just now intermodal? But from a total company standpoint is the anticipation as we start the year it\u2019s still going to be a negative headwind and then as we move into the second and the merchandise volumes and industrial picks up and that\u2019s when it flips to sort of from a headwind to a tailwind as we think about having a slight positive for the full year? Thanks. Alan Shaw : You are asking -- I am sorry. Jim Squires : Decline of RPU throughout the year. Cindy Sanborn : Yeah. RPU. Jordan Alliger : Yeah. As we start the year. Alan Shaw : Oh! Yeah. It\u2019s a great question. Yeah. And I\u2019m glad you asked that. Yeah. We -- I need to make it clear that, yes, we are expecting a year-over-year decline in RPU in the first quarter. A lot of that is mixed. A lot of that is fuel surcharge headwinds. And then as you go through the year, ultimately we\u2019ll get to a point where we\u2019ve got a modest increase in RPU that is driven by, we\u2019ve talked about a 9% revenue increase and a high upper single digit volume increase. Jordan Alliger : Great. Thanks so much. That was my question. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Jim Squires for closing comments. Jim Squires : Thank you for your questions today. We look forward to talking with you again next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participating. This does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Have a wonderful day.",

A brief question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. If anyone should require operator assistance during the conference, please press star, zero on your telephone keypad. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It\u2019s now my pleasure to introduce your host, Meghan Achimasi, Senior Director of Investor Relations for Norfolk Southern Corporation. Thank you, you may begin. Meghan Achimasi : Thank you and good morning. Please note that during today\u2019s call, we will make certain forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties and may differ materially from actual results. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. Our presentation slides are available at nscorp.com in the Investors section, along with our reconciliation of non-GAAP measures used today to the comparable GAAP measures. Along those lines, recall that in the first quarter of 2020 we launched a rationalization of our locomotive fleet by 703 units, which resulted in a non-cash charge of $385 million, so we will speak to the quarterly results excluding that charge.  A full transcript and download will be posted after the call. It is now my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern\u2019s Chairman, President and CEO, Jim Squires. James Squires : Good morning everyone and welcome to Norfolk Southern\u2019s first quarter 2021 earnings call. Joining me today are Cindy Sanborn, Chief Operating Officer; Alan Shaw, Chief Marketing Officer; and Mark George, Chief Financial Officer. Norfolk Southern started strong in 2021. Our successful implementation of precision scheduled railroading translated into solid financial results. Our team delivered all-time records for operating ratio and free cash flow and achieved first quarter records for earnings per share and operating income. Northern Southern employees accomplished this despite significant supply chain disruptions brought on by severe weather nationwide in February. For the quarter, revenue increased 1% due primarily to volume growth up 3% year-over-year. At the same time, expenses declined 3% or $48 million compared to our adjusted first quarter of 2020. Throughout the quarter, we continued to streamline resources resulting in impressive gains in workforce asset and fuel productivity. Looking ahead, we remain intent on achieving strong revenue growth and efficiencies to propel the bottom line and create shareholder value. Investments in technology and sustainability will be critical, and I\u2019ll provide some recent examples of these after we review the quarter. But first, let me turn the call over to the team to go through the quarterly results in more detail, starting with Cindy. Cindy Sanborn : Good morning. I am excited to share our first quarter achievements and what we have in the hopper looking ahead.  Our team on the ground is proving its capability and motivation to move quickly on advancing efficiency and restoring service reliability. We\u2019ve also introduced a few new team members with PSR experience who are leading initiatives alongside our field team to increase productivity inside our major hump and flat switching terminals. These actions are having an immediate impact for our shareholders and our customers. Slide 6 shows our operational indicators. While volumes were variable in the quarter, efficiency gains were consistent. By absorbing additional volumes within our existing train network, despite how those volumes varied during the quarter, we were able to realize substantial gains in train length and train weight and improve fuel efficiency. Productivity initiatives such as locomotive horsepower optimization and additional usage of distributed power were key to the success. Execution of our efficient scheduled railroading plan enabled us to handle more freight with fewer resources compared to a year ago.  Let me add some more color on train length. We are committed to improving productivity by running longer trains, and accomplishing that involves targeted investments within certain parts of our network. During the quarter, we completed an initial assessment of incremental infrastructure that will aid our long train initiative. As a result, we\u2019ve begun construction on a long siding extension in the Chicago-Atlanta corridor that will be complete ahead of this year\u2019s peak season, and we have identified two others that we will begin construction on this year. We will quickly identify and address opportunities to efficiently deploy capital to support both train consolidation and organic growth. Moving to Slide 7, weekly carload fluctuations tell an important story of the quarter. Volumes rose quickly coming out of the new year\u2019s holiday and were running several percentage points higher than last year, until severe winter weather arrived in February. This affected both railroad operations and our shippers, with Chicago being hit the hardest by both snow and extreme cold. While we kept main lines fluid, overall supply chain congestion slowed traffic through terminals. I would like to especially recognize our field operations, engineering and signals teams for ensuring a safe and efficient operation despite historic cold deep into our network. Their work is critical to the success of NS and our customers. Beyond the weather episodes, we continued to adjust our yard network to handle volume increases expected during the year. We are focusing on driving improved efficiency and reliability at our key terminals, which in turn creates a capacity dividend that enables us to absorb both volume variability and overall growth. We are continuing our yard and terminal focus in the second quarter. Slide 8 shows that to start the year, network fluidity was comparable to 2019 levels, but a condensed winter that followed in February impacted our velocity and terminal dwell and snarled supply chains in general. As you see by the network performance trends over the past seven weeks, we continue to progress and are committed to further improvement to get our service reliability to where we want it to be. Additional progress creating consistent fluidity leads to enhanced rail car velocity, which in turn benefits our shareholders and customers. I\u2019ll finish on Slide 9 by explaining how we continued Norfolk Southern\u2019s operating transformation during the quarter and how it showed up in the results. We\u2019ve undertaken a series of focused initiatives to improve capacity and drive down dwell at our major terminals, including current humps as well as flat switching operations. These improvements support the longer and heavier trains we are running, allowing us to operate efficiently with fewer resources. Finally, Q1 reinforced the benefits of effective interline cooperation, and we are building on that even though the winter weather has passed.  The results show in both productivity and asset usage. These trends have been improving since we implemented Top 21 in mid-2019, but the team has been able to both accelerate and extend the improvement and we are very well positioned to continue these trends, leveraging our efficiency initiatives with rising volumes.  Thank you for your time, and I\u2019ll turn it over to Alan. Alan Shaw : Thank you Cindy, and good morning everyone. Beginning on Slide 11, we experienced significant volume volatility in the first quarter. We delivered a strong start to the year with January volume exceeding last year, while February was challenged with winter weather events that disrupted supply chains cross the country. Progressing into March, business levels improved as supply chain fluidity started to recover and we adjusted to dynamic shifts in the freight environment. I will now turn to Slide 12, highlighting our revenue and volume performance for the first quarter of 2021. Despite the difficult operating conditions, overall revenue improved 1% year-over-year to $2.6 billion while volume grew 3%. Revenue per unit excluding fuel improved in each of our individual business units this quarter, reflecting our commitment to grow yield as part of our long-term strategy, though total revenue per unit and revenue per unit excluding fuel were down slightly due to the mix of intermodal volume growth with declines in merchandise volume. Merchandise revenue fell 4% from prior year levels on a 3% volume decline. This segment faced difficult pre-COVID comps in the energy sector. Partially offsetting these declines were gains in soybean, steel and automotive shipments. March U.S. light vehicle sales surged to a 17.7 million unit seasonally adjusted annual rate, the second highest March ever, while inventories are at a 10-year low. Merchandise revenue per unit excluding fuel reached a record high for the quarter, delivering 24 consecutive quarters of year-over-year improvement in this market.  Intermodal revenue and volume both increased compared to the first quarter of 2020. Volume growth was driven by a continuation of the inventory replenishment cycle combined with the tight truck market and strength in consumer activity as retail sales grew 9.8% in March, the largest sequential increase since May 2020 when sales initially rebounded as states reopened from shutdowns. Intermodal revenue per unit excluding fuel improved 6% year-over-year, supported by continued strength in the LTL market driven by growth in ecommerce. This marks the 17th consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement in this metric and a record high. Our coal business delivered 5% revenue growth in the quarter. Volume gains were driven mostly by export thermal shipments as the global economic recovery continued, as well as tailwinds from China-Australia trade tensions. Domestic met and coke volumes continued to improve as demand for finished product accelerated. Utility demand was down as it continued to be pressured from product substitution and lower industrial load. Revenue per unit improved 3% year-over-year, inclusive of a $9 million incremental gain from volume shortfall revenue. We have an unrivalled consumer-oriented franchise that continued to benefit our customers and shareholders throughout the quarter. Although severe weather certainly impacted business levels particularly in February, our diverse industrial franchise serves the improving manufacturing economy and we saw gains from rising commodity prices. We are delivering sustainable revenue growth in line with our long term strategy to capitalize on the strength of our franchise and provide value-added solutions in the marketplace. Moving to Slide 13, our outlook for the remainder of the year is strong. Consensus for U.S. GDP growth is north of 6%, the highest in the last 40 years. PMI rose to 64.7 in March, hitting the highest level since 1983, while inventories remain low. These are expected to be key factors driving robust economic activity for the rest of 2021. We remain confident that our markets will achieve volume growth in the high single digits this year and our franchise is poised to capitalize on the expected growth that will drive value for both our customers and our shareholders.  Merchandise growth will be driven by continued expansion in the manufacturing sector. Elevated demand levels coupled with low dealer inventories in the automotive segment will drive volume gains; however, the current semiconductor chip shortage creates uncertainty as to the timing of the recovery. U.S. light vehicle production currently is expected to exceed pre-pandemic levels in 2021. That production growth along with the return of total industrial production to pre-pandemic levels will drive steel demand, which is another market where we expect to generate volume growth as the year progresses. We also anticipate our energy markets within merchandise will benefit from the return of gasoline demand in the consumer travel sector as the economy fully reopens.  Our intermodal franchise will continue to build on the momentum associated with the ongoing U.S. economic recovery. An expected rise in consumer spending, low inventory levels, and continued tightness in the trucking sector are all key factors boosting growth opportunities. Spending on durable goods is expected to grow 15% in 2021, which bodes well for our domestic intermodal franchise that is closely correlated with consumption markets. International intermodal will benefit from the resumption of global trade activity.  Coal business will remain challenged in 2021. The export thermal market continues as a near term strength, although with a lower RPU than average. Domestic met and coke volume is expected to improve in line with the economic recovery. Natural gas and renewal energy source conversions will continue to negatively impact the utility markets. Decisions on stockpile levels will be determined by summer weather and gas prices. In summary, we expect to generate revenue growth in 2021 as economic conditions continue to improve. As the needs of our customers constantly evolve, we remain diligent in delivering valuable transportation solutions to the marketplace. We continue to focus on initiatives to drive growth, margin improvement, and a strong service product. We are confident in our ability to leverage our value in the marketplace to secure new opportunities to support our customers\u2019 growth and grow our margins.  I will now turn it over to Mark, who will cover our financial results. Mark George : Thanks Alan. As Jim mentioned, the OR and EPS records we achieved in the quarter came through disciplined cost control while handling additional volume in the midst of pretty challenging operating conditions.  On Slide 15, walking you through our summarized results compared with an adjusted first quarter 2020, we reported an OR of 61.5%, which was a 220 basis point improvement, and an earnings per share improvement of $0.08. I will note that the $0.08 improvement in EPS was dampened by the absence of a gain recognized last year from a 2012 income tax refund that equated to $0.09, so core EPS improvement in the quarter was $0.17. Moving to Slide 16, revenue grew 1% in the quarter due primarily to the 3% increase in volume year-over-year, with growth in intermodal and coal more than offsetting declines in merchandise. At the same time, we drove operating expenses down by 3% as we harvested additional benefits from workforce and asset productivity. The volume growth coupled with the productivity drove the operating ratio down to a record low 61.5%, improving 220 basis points year-over-year and 30 basis points sequentially versus Q4. This produced operating income of $1 billion, another record, up $62 million or 7% year-over-year, and we generated first quarter free cash flow of $750 million, also a record, up $161 million or 27% versus the first quarter of 2020. Moving to a drill down of operating expense improvement on Slide 17, the reduction of $48 million or 3% comes with improvements in nearly all expense categories. Material and other were collectively down $15 million or 9% as we continued to see lower spend associated with fewer but more productive locomotives thanks to the rationalization of equipment last year. Fuel expense was down $12 million with benefits evenly split between price and reduced consumption, thanks largely to a 3% improvement in fuel efficiency.  Comp and benefits declined $11 million or 2% from lower employment costs related to a workforce that was 12% smaller than a year ago and 2% smaller than the fourth quarter. Partially offsetting these tailwinds are headwinds this year from higher and stock-based compensation. Purchase services and rents were collectively down $10 million or 2% as reduced freight car expenses more than offset higher spend associated with technology investments and increased intermodal volumes. When matched to a 3% volume increase, the 3% decline in opex provides another quarter of additional productivity, building in the work we\u2019ve done over the past several quarters, as you\u2019ll see here on Slide 18. From the quarter that we launched our Top 21 operating plan, we have made meaningful progress on our workforce productivity with GTMs per employee up 16% since the third quarter of 2019 and a 340 basis point improvement in our operating ratio. We remain intensely focused and committed to drive further improvements. Turning to Slide 19 for the remainder of the P&L below operating income, you\u2019ll see that other income net of $7 million is $15 million of 68% unfavorable year-over-year due primarily to lower net returns on our company-owned life insurance investments. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was just over 22%, and recall last Q1 we had the 2012 tax refund that resulted in a lower effective tax rate. As a result, net income increased by 1% compared to pre-tax earnings growth of 5%. Earnings per share rose by 3%, supported by 2.3 million shares that we repurchased in the quarter at an average price of $254.  Wrapping up now with our free cash flow on Slide 20, free cash flow at $750 million was buoyed by strong operating cash conversion and a relatively modest $265 million in property additions in the quarter, which was below our annual targeted run rate for the year due to timing issues, including weather related delays and capital spend. Shareholder distributions totaled $840 million, an increase of $132 million versus prior year thanks to our recently increased dividend and a meaningful increase in our share repurchase activity to nearly $600 million. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Jim. James Squire : Thank you Mark. You\u2019ve heard this morning about all the productivity improvements stemming from our adoption of PSR. Our company is also in the middle of a digital transformation. We expect investments in technology to drive the next phase of improvements in service growth, efficiency and sustainability at Norfolk Southern, and we\u2019re already making great headway. Slide 22 shows a few recent examples.  The introduction of new mobile apps and a redesign of our customer portal are giving customers a more user-friendly and truck-like experience, delivering real time shipment intelligence, facility truck to rail conversions, and reducing emissions. We\u2019re putting an easy-to-use mobile application in the hands of our train conductors, streamlining internal workflow and improving shipment visibility for customers. We\u2019re digitizing our internal and external communications through a new CRM platform, enabling better, faster decision making.  We\u2019re using new information systems to promote intermodal equipment utilization and efficiency at our intermodal terminals. We\u2019re using predictive analytics to reduce locomotive failures and plan maintenance proactively. Machine vision technology is creating a path to automated track and freight car inspections with manifold benefits to safety and efficiency. On Slide 23, we show that NS has been a sustainability leader for over a decade. Years ago, we recognized the importance of reducing our environment footprint, beginning in 2007 when we first established our sustainability program. We\u2019ve been reporting on our results ever since, delivering on the goals we set forth. Here we highlight a few key milestones and also show a few examples of external recognition, including recently being named by the Wall Street Journal as one of the 100 Most Sustainably Managed Companies. In summary, we have a track record of leadership on sustainability which is good for business and the right thing to do for all our stakeholders.  Although we don\u2019t generally update guidance, given the unusual circumstances in the first quarter with February\u2019s extreme cold and a global supply chain disruption, let me wrap up restating our confidence in our ability to meet the market for full year 2021 with the expectation that strength in consumer-oriented and manufacturing markets will drive 9% revenue growth year-over-year. For the full year, we expect to achieve more than 300 basis points of OR improvement versus our adjusted 2020 result, and we expect to end 2021 with a 60% run rate OR. As we\u2019ve said before, once we achieve these targets, we won\u2019t stop improving. We\u2019re optimistic about growth in the year ahead and all the initiatives we have underway to create long-term sustained value for our shareholders.  Before we open the call to Q&A, I want to quickly address the proposed transactions involving another Class 1 railroad. We\u2019re watching the situation closely, but we won\u2019t be discussing the proposals or industry speculation generally. As the regulatory review process unfolds, there will be opportunities for further discussion. As our first quarter performance demonstrates, we remain focused on enhancing operational efficiency and delivering value for our shareholders and customers, and we look forward to addressing your questions about our results and outlook. With that, we\u2019ll open the call to questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Chris Wetherbee : Okay, thanks. Good morning everybody. I wanted to see if we could start with the outlook, particularly the operating ratio, so strong performance in the first quarter. If you look at normal seasonality, it actually seems like you\u2019re on kind of a 60 or maybe even sub-60 run rate as it stands right now, based on what you\u2019ve been able to achieve first quarter through the rest of the year in the last five years. Maybe you can give us some thoughts and your view on that progress towards that 60 run rate, and are there some things from a cost perspective that we should keep in mind as the year progresses or maybe is there the opportunity to potentially exceed your expectations? James Squire : Good morning Chris. Let me begin by pointing out that while seasonality certainly hasn\u2019t been repealed, it was a strong first quarter and somewhat anomalous, given the surge of volume we\u2019ve experienced both in the first quarter and in the fourth quarter due to the economies reopening. Also, we were out there with some bullish guidance, some pretty bullish outlook on the economy during 2021 early. In January, we forecast 9% volume growth for the year, so we got ahead of this. We were feeling bullish about the economy and the business opportunity way back in January. So here we are now - we\u2019ve posted a great first quarter, it\u2019s a good start to the year. We\u2019re off and running, and we remain optimistic about the year to come. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll talk a lot more about the specifics during the call, but we remain optimistic and we\u2019re going to continue to push. We expect to be where we said we would be back in January by the end of this year in terms of OR. Chris Wetherbee : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. I appreciate it. Then maybe just a follow-up on the progress you\u2019re making in workforce productivity you highlighted on Slide 18 and some of the other efforts you\u2019re making around PSR. It seems like the process is unfolding quite nicely, so can you talk maybe about sort of the bigger picture, maybe beyond 2021 - you know, what maybe the opportunity is for you to continue to improve the cost structure of the business? Cindy Sanborn : Chris, this is Cindy. I\u2019ll answer your question, and I appreciate the question. You know, as we talked about and you saw in Mark\u2019s notes--slides around GTMs per employee, that was a record for us this quarter even with all the challenges that we face, and we\u2019re going to continue to see opportunities as we consolidate trains, get longer trains. We are making some investments that I called out in my remarks that help us with train length by investing in some sidings. Part of PSR, and as I\u2019ve learned it through the last few years, it is about getting your plan right-sized for the time and then continuing to tweak it, continuing to find efficiencies in places that maybe you don\u2019t expect. I think we\u2019ll be able to see continued improvement in locomotive utilization, fuel, headcount, all of those areas beyond 2021. As Jim described, when we were thinking about where we should be at the end of this year, we\u2019re not going to stop with where we end up.  We\u2019ll continue to find those opportunities, so I feel very, very good about what the team has accomplished so far, even with a very challenging, very volatile first quarter of this year, and that gives me great confidence that we\u2019ll continue through 2021 and into \u201922 with very good efficiency performance. Chris Wetherbee : Okay, well thanks very much for the time. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens Inc. Please proceed with your question. Justin Long : Thanks and good morning. Jim, I know you said you weren\u2019t going to comment on the proposed mergers from the Canadian rails and KCS, but I did just want to ask generally if you had any thoughts around rail mergers and your willingness to participate in further consolidation if the opportunity were to present itself. James Squire : Well Justin, I recognize that this situation is kind of dominating the airwaves right now, and there are a lot of interested industry stakeholders focused on the proposed transaction, including NS, and we will be protective of our shareholders\u2019 interests and our customers\u2019 interests. We will be active participants in any transaction that may transpire out of this. With that said, I really think it would not be fruitful for us this morning to focus on other people\u2019s deals - you know, hypothetical knock-on effects, what the STB may do, etc., but rather let\u2019s focus on our first quarter, which I humbly submit was pretty spectacular, and our outlook for the rest of the year. Justin Long : Fair enough. Maybe for my follow-up, just to circle back to the guidance, the guidance for the OR improvement of 300 basis points, or greater than 300 basis points this year, is somewhat open ended. Mark, I\u2019m curious - has anything changed in terms of your expectation on headcount this year, and then maybe you could comment on yields and what you\u2019re thinking for RPU as well. Mark George : Sure. With regard to headcount, you may recall back in January, Cindy and I reiterated that we would expect headcount and employment levels to be flat to down over the course of this year despite the volume guidance that we gave, which was high single digits leading to revenue that would be roughly 9%. We\u2019re tracking to that right now and we actually believe that we will continue to stay on that guidance for the balance of this year, so we\u2019re feeling good about the way that\u2019s unfolding and transpiring. Alan, you want to talk a little bit about yields and RPU? Alan Shaw : Yes Justin, we had talked about to expect a reduction in revenue per unit in the first quarter and then year-over-year growth in quarters two through four. That\u2019s still our anticipation. I expect that we\u2019ll see RPU growth through the remainder of the year and full year. We\u2019re sticking with our 9% revenue guidance for the year. Most of that is associated with volume increases, so RPU will improve slightly. That\u2019s more of a reflection of mix with intermodal growing pretty rapidly and strength in the lower RPU export thermal market than it is with respect to price. Justin Long : Okay, I appreciate the time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott Group : Yes, thanks. Morning guys. Just a couple things on the cost side. Compensation per employee was up a lot. Any thoughts on how to model that? Then we\u2019ve just seen a little volatility in purchase services costs. Just any thoughts on how to model that, if that stays down year-over-year, if that starts to trend higher. Thank you. Mark George : Thanks Scott for the question. Comp and ben per employee was up 11% in the first quarter, and really roughly half of that was related to the incentive and stock-based comp headwind that we reported there on the slide in the first quarter. You can expect that that kind of headwind will persist throughout the balance of this year. The other half of the headwind is really split between the increase we saw in the first quarter in overtime, which shouldn\u2019t persist throughout the balance of the year, as well as the normal couple, few points of wage inflation headwind as well as some little uptick in payroll tax that should also persist. There will be some level of comp headwind. It won\u2019t be 11% in the balance of the year, but maybe a little bit more than half of that is probably a good way to model it.  Now for purchase services, it was a low quarter for us for sure. I think the rest of the year is going to depend on kind of the volumetric pieces that we continue to work on, but engineering--remember engineering spend, that will step up during the summer months, and also IT. A lot of the IT investments are going to really start to hit us more in the back half of the year, second, third, fourth quarter, so I do think that you\u2019ll see purchase services up from this level, probably back to where we were in the fourth quarter. That\u2019d probably be a good way to model it quarterly going forward. Scott Group : Okay, thanks. Then Alan, just quickly for you, can you just talk about the underlying pricing environment and what you\u2019re seeing there? Alan Shaw : Yes Scott, it\u2019s improving, as you would anticipate. We\u2019re seeing commodity prices move up, steel prices are at record highs. You\u2019ve seen strength in lumber, you\u2019ve seen strength in grain products, seen strength in plastics, and as we\u2019ve progress through the first couple months of the year, we\u2019ve raised our plan on our transactional business within intermodal.  Now, recognize that\u2019s a very small component of our franchise; however, we are seeing continued strength in the trucking market. Some of the things I\u2019m reading, Scott, are point to the fact that truck capacity is actually projected to tighten throughout the year from a very robust environment right now, so we\u2019re feeling pretty good about the pricing environment for the remainder of this year and as we move into 2022. Scott Group : Okay, thank you guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Allison Landry : Good morning, thanks. Some of the other rails that have implemented PSR provide trip plan compliance metrics for car load and intermodal networks. Is this something that you guys look at closely, and if so, could you just give us a sense for where you might be tracking on this metric or whatever metric you think is most relevant? Just really trying to understand how network reliability has improved and where it stands today, outside of just looking at the public service metrics that we can see. Cindy Sanborn : Allison, thank you. What I will say is what we share with you is what we\u2019re really working on, and you\u2019ve seen since I\u2019ve been here, not necessarily service related but we added train length to some of the measures that we provide some color on. On the service piece, we did have service deliver index - SDI, and found that that wasn\u2019t something we\u2019re really managing to. What we\u2019re managing to more as we put in PSR was car velocity, and so that\u2019s going to be the area that we\u2019re focusing on and have developed that measure, broadly created the ability to drill down for accountability at local levels, looked at it beyond just the geographic component, also the car type component of car velocity, what car types are moving faster than others, and that\u2019s really where we\u2019re going to be headed in how we think about that and talk about that. In time to come, we\u2019ll also share that with you. Allison Landry : Okay, perfect. Cindy, also you talked about the use of distributed power - obviously that I\u2019m sure is contributing to the improvement in fuel efficiency. Could you give us--like, what percent of the trains are now equipped or running with BPUs, and then just in terms of closing the gap with some of your peers in terms of gallons per GPM, when you think about the ways that you can improve that, are BPUs and expanding the use of them a big driver, or is it more increased train length and weight? If you could sort of speak to the different drivers and if you expect the fuel efficiency or the improvement to accelerate as we move through 2021. Thank you. Cindy Sanborn : Okay Allison. I would say that all of the above that you mentioned, including energy management, are levers for us to continue to improve in locomotive utilization and therefore fuel demand, so I see a very strong opportunity to continue to run our trains at full capability of locomotives - we call that full pen. I\u2019ve talked about that on earlier calls. In our manifest network, we\u2019re at full pen maybe 13% to 15% of the time at this point on a district by district basis, so we see some opportunity there. You talked about distributed power. We have--actually, we increased distributed power utilization on trains that we didn\u2019t use distributed power by 11%, almost 12% in the first quarter. It is a record for us, and the last record was fourth quarter, so we have real good trajectory with distributed power which, to your point, is also beneficial to us from a fuel perspective. We\u2019ve got a lot of work to do on fuel, and those are the areas that we\u2019re working on to get us there. Allison Landry : Great, thanks Cindy. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Ravi Shanker : Thanks, good morning everyone. A couple of questions on intermodal, maybe looking out a little bit here. Cindy, what percentage of your carload volumes do you think will be intermodal about maybe three years from now, kind of just looking at the growth trajectory there versus the other end markets? Also, how does the mix in intermodal today compare to where it was a few years ago? Just trying to see if that mix gap that has traditionally existed is closing or not. Alan Shaw : Ravi, we\u2019re expecting the intermodal to lead our growth for the next couple years. Actually, I should point to consumer-oriented products. We\u2019ve got an unrivalled intermodal franchise in the east. We also serve more U.S. vehicle production than any other railroad in North America, and we\u2019ve got a consumer oriented merchandise franchise where we\u2019re actively focused on providing a truck-like product there to compete with trucks. We\u2019re really intent on providing the simplicity of trucks coupled with the efficiency of rail, and that revolves around a very highly reliable and predictable service product with very good digital tools for our interface with our customers. That\u2019s where you\u2019re going to see the growth markets from us, and then we\u2019ll participate in the ebbs and flows within the commodity markets. You know, you don\u2019t have to go back that long - 2011, we had $3.5 billion of coal revenue and about 45% of our overall revenue was associated with the energy markets. Now, we\u2019ve got about $1 billion of coal revenue and we\u2019ve got about $2 billion in the energy markets, so despite that mix and despite that shift, we\u2019ve improved our margin profile as well, so we\u2019re very confident in our plan going forward. We\u2019ve got a robust franchise that faces the fastest growing segments of the U.S. economy, which is going to benefit our customers and our shareholders. Ravi Shanker : Got it, thanks for that update. Also, kind of just following up on the digital update that you gave us, which was very useful, I\u2019m wondering if you guys have spent much time at all thinking about autonomous trucks and how that might come into the network or influence the truck market over the next several years, and just what your view there is. James Squire : It\u2019s a threat and we view it as such. The time horizon is somewhat uncertain, but it\u2019s certainly something to be aware of and to be planning for, and we are. We are doing so through efforts to automate our own operations and to go down the path of more efficient and productive railroading via automation, via digital investments ourselves. Mark George : That said, we know that in our industry, we\u2019ve got a much more attractive sustainability profile even if trucking goes on an automated fashion. We still provide a better sustainability solution. Ravi Shanker : Great, thanks everyone. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Thomas Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Thomas Wadewitz : Yes, good morning. I wanted to see if you could comment--I guess this is probably for Cindy. Obviously there\u2019s some constraints across the system, I think we\u2019ve seen it at some of the intermodal terminals. Some of it is kind of in your control, probably a lot of it is not. How do you think about where you\u2019re at from a fluidity perspective at some of your key intermodal terminals, and what needs to be done to see that improve? James Squire : Alan, why don\u2019t you take that one? Alan Shaw : Yes. Tom, if you\u2019ll permit, I\u2019d like to cover that because it involves that intersection between our network and our customers\u2019 network. What you\u2019ve seen and what you continue to see is stress across the entire supply chain. That can be with warehouses, which are having trouble with productivity associated with COVID protocols, but they\u2019re also having trouble with labor staffing. You see that in the drayage community as well, and so that could back things up. Despite that, we delivered 13% increase in intermodal revenue ex-fuel surcharge in the quarter on top of 11% improvement in intermodal revenue ex-fuel surcharge in the fourth quarter. We\u2019ve got a great franchise, we\u2019ve got the best channel partners in the industry. We are collaborating with them on how to solve some of these issues and help them grow even more. Cindy Sanborn : I\u2019d add to that, Tom, from the network perspective, we work really closely with intermodal terminal folks to make sure we are moving trains appropriately for the support--with the freight that can actually be offloaded, so there\u2019s good coordination so that any challenges within the terminals do not spill over onto [indiscernible]. Thomas Wadewitz : Right, okay. Then for a follow-up, Cindy, you had implemented some changes in the southeast part of the network, I believe it was fourth quarter. When you make changes, sometimes there are adjustments to the new schedule or new flow of traffic, and then you\u2019ve also had weather and growing volumes. How do you think that that--you know, did that work well, and how do you think about additional schedule changes, or do you think you kind of stick with the current schedule and just execute against that? Cindy Sanborn : Thanks for the question. The southeast plan that you describe, we actually started implementing in November, very beginning of November, and we\u2019re largely through some of the adjustments that we needed to make as we came into the first part of the year. That was working well, then we kind of hit this volatility that I described in my prepared remarks that was induced by weather, that was--and also volume, and so I step back from the southeast plan and almost go all the way back to the changes with Top 21 and our terminal footprint and how it\u2019s changed, the consolidation of trains to make longer trains and how that\u2019s been beneficial to us, and we really pressure tested it with volume and we had to make some adjustments, some in the southeast plan, certainly across the north. You saw our service product, maybe as we came out of March, we were starting to really see some improvements in dwell and train velocity, but we did have to do some tweaks. We had to get back in there and make some changes. They were highly productive, they helped us be more effective and efficient, and I think we\u2019ll continue to see the service-related measures improve. Real pleased with some of the work particularly at Bellevue and Elkhart, that has taken place over the last couple of weeks and months, and I think we\u2019re really on a good glide path. I will also say that all the changes we made, the volatility that we worked through in the quarter, we didn\u2019t see cars online jump up. We were able to continue to move, continue work with our customers so that we didn\u2019t see a drag on additional car volume that was sitting on the network, so I feel really good about where we are and a lot of good work went into getting us to this point. I\u2019m very, very pleased with the team. Thomas Wadewitz : Great, thank you for the perspective. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Amit Mehrotra : Thanks, morning everybody. Mark, you provided that cost structure slide in the past, the fixed versus variable cost structure and kind of the implications for incremental margin. The cost structure, I guess, is obviously evolving as you implement PSR, but there\u2019s obviously a lot of revenue growth year-on-year in the second quarter and hopefully beyond. I know you guys have this OR target out there that\u2019s helpful, but what\u2019s the right calibration for incrementals on that growth, on that outsized growth in Q2 and beyond just relative to the cost structure disclosure you\u2019ve provided in the past? Mark George : Thanks Amit. Look, our outlook is to generate strong incrementals throughout the balance of the year, and that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to accrete and grow our operating ratio--sorry, shrink our operating ratio. Our goal here is on pretty much all line items to absorb and hold the--absorb the volume and hold the cost as flat as possible, and that\u2019s kind of the challenge and the mandate we\u2019ve given to the organization. That\u2019s going to really translate into the OR improvement that we\u2019re projecting.  As I mentioned, you\u2019ll have some geography. Purchase services really started off strong. Probably going to see that pop a little bit, for the reasons I just cited a few minutes ago, but when we look at some of the other line items like rents and comp and ben, etc., our goal is really to just try to hold firm and absorb volume, so I think you\u2019re going to see good incrementals the rest of the year. Amit Mehrotra : So if I\u2019m just interpreting your comments, this $1.6 billion opex base is kind of the neighborhood you\u2019re going to be in over the course of the year as revenue ramps? Is that correct? Mark George : That\u2019s kind of where we\u2019re targeting. I\u2019m not going to get more precise than rounding to the hundreds of millions, but yes, that\u2019s our goal, is to sit there and try to hold cost while we absorb the volume. But of course, one of the variables, Amit, is fuel will go up throughout the balance of the year - we are projecting that, but we should have some--hopefully some lag on fuel. Surcharge should help mitigate some of that too. Amit Mehrotra : Okay, that\u2019s helpful, thank you. Then just one quick follow-up for Alan, I guess. The coal yields, consistently kind of surprised to the upside, and then just wondering your best guess in terms of where you think coal yields will shake out as we progress through the remainder of the year. Alan Shaw : Yes Amit, good morning. I\u2019d prefer to surprise to the upside than the downside on yields. Amit Mehrotra : That\u2019s for sure. Alan Shaw : We did call out a specific volume shortfall accrual in the quarter that was $9 million ahead of last year, so with that respect, that helped. We had a lot of cross currents with respect to our overall yield in coal as well. I talked a lot about export thermal - for us, we were able to deliver 66% growth in export thermal coal in the quarter, and that\u2019s due very specifically to the great service product that we\u2019ve had into that market. We\u2019re happy to have that business, it\u2019s accretive to our margins, our bottom line, and helps OR; however, it does come with a lower overall RPU. Then within the utility franchise, we actually had more growth in our utility south franchise than utility north, which is positive for overall RPU, so there\u2019s a lot of things going on within coal. With export thermal as the growth driver, going forward that\u2019s primarily going to put pressure on overall RPU and, frankly, we\u2019ll see what happens in the utility franchise. We\u2019ve got a number of plants right now whose stockpiles have deteriorated over the winter, but very few are in the process of rebuilding stockpiles now, which is frankly what you would expect during shoulder months. That\u2019s a point of caution going forward, is utility volumes and how that shakes out, and then what\u2019s the impact on overall RPU. Amit Mehrotra : Yes, okay. Makes sense. Thank you very much. Congrats on the good results. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Jordan Alliger : Hi, good morning. Just a quick question on intermodal and the pricing. It seems like the yield-up maybe is turning a real corner - 6% ex-fuel. I\u2019m just curious specifically on intermodal yields, given the truck tightness and hopefully service getting better, as you alluded to, is this a yield number, sort of a core yield number that we could think about going forward from here? Alan Shaw : Jordan, we had some positive mix associated with our intermodal franchise. We saw domestic volumes increase more than international volumes through the quarter. Domestic is generally a 53-foot container relative to a 40-foot container but has a higher RPU. Then even within that, you see that supercharge LTL premium market, which is benefiting RPU.  I\u2019ll remind you and everyone else that we\u2019ve got 17 consecutive quarters of overall RPU improvement in our air modal franchise through cycles in the market. There was--contract rates in the truck market went down last year, and yet our intermodal RPU ex-fuel was up 3.4%. There was a truck recession in 2019, and yet our intermodal RPU ex-fuel went up 2.4%, so we take a very steady approach to valuing the quality of our product and in our approach with our channel partners. We really want them to be able to grow and compete, and so what they\u2019re looking for from us is rate surety over the course of the year as they go into their bid cycles. Over time, our intermodal RPU ex-fuel in our pricing has outpaced that of the contract market and the spot market, and we\u2019re leading in growth, so I think we\u2019ve got the right strategy going forward to deliver value for our intermodal channel partners and our shareholders. Jordan Alliger : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Brian Ossenbeck : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe one for Cindy. Can you just give us a sense as to how you see resources in terms of headcount out in the field, if any of the different regions require a little bit more attention or not, how the recall from furloughs is going, how retention is going, that sort of thing, especially when you look at the strong growth you\u2019re expecting? You mentioned there\u2019s a few, it sounded like leaders maybe a little bit higher up - we saw one announced. Are there any other folks with maybe a bit more PSR experience that you\u2019re looking to bring onboard? Cindy Sanborn : Yes Brian, on the headcount side on [indiscernible], I mentioned or you saw--I\u2019ll start with this, you saw it in Mark\u2019s slides that we\u2019re continuing to improve in our productivity. We are--and we are guiding to be flat to down from where we ended December. All that is still in play. We are however--we have recalled furloughs in many of our locations where we\u2019re out of furloughs, and we are doing some spot hiring. It\u2019s not broad-based, and frankly it\u2019s to help offset attrition slightly. We do have attrition that continues quarter by quarter, year by year, so we are doing some hiring. We want to make sure we provide a good service product to our customers. We\u2019re very integrated with what the forecast looks like with Alan\u2019s team and have spent a lot of time working on a training plan that gives us a lot more agility in being able to respond when we need to, in places where we do see attrition and we need to backfill. We\u2019ve kind of decentralized our raining and gotten it down to a much shorter period of time, about eight weeks, where we\u2019re actually training folks in the places where they\u2019re going to work, so they\u2019re still going to be a very safe employee but we\u2019re able to condense the amount of--I guess improve the speed to market, if you will, and respond to needs of service. We\u2019ve got to provide a good service product to our customers. With the volume that we\u2019re seeing, we will need to hire, but I feel really good about the process that we have and the ability for us to continue to manage that, and overall still improve our productivity around T&E productivity.  I forgot your second question. Alan Shaw : PSR talent. Brian Ossenbeck : Yes, sorry - PSR talent. Cindy Sanborn : Yes, so we did publicly announce Hunt Cary joining from UP. He and I had worked together over several different stops in our career in different railroads. He\u2019s been a real good add, integrated well with the team. There are several others in the organization that we have brought on, and if we have a need, we will continue to find good fits for them within NS. I think part of it is the integration of it, and that\u2019s gone very, very well, and I think the long tenured NS folks are happy to have the additional support and helping them make the changes that we need. I feel really good about where we are, and we\u2019ll always be looking for places where we can bring external folks in with PSR experience that can help us achieve our goals. Brian Ossenbeck : Right. Okay, thanks Cindy. One quick one for Mark. Can you just--obviously a very strong quarter, but can you give us some sense as to if you quantify the impact of weather or, I guess more specifically, on fuel with timing lags, how that impacted the quarter would be helpful to put into context as well. Thank you. Mark George : Yes, we didn\u2019t really quantify weather. I mean, certainly it did have an impact. We felt it in the form of higher overtime, certainly higher re-crews. We had some snow removal costs as well. We just didn\u2019t think it was material enough to break out. Look, overall fuel was a headwind in the quarter because we didn\u2019t really get the lag benefit of the fuel surcharge coming through here in the first quarter, so we had $34 million of headwind in fuel revenue. But we did have very good fuel efficiency performance that provided good tailwind for us on the expense side, and I think you saw the numbers on the slide for fuel. Thanks Brian. Brian Ossenbeck : Right, thanks Mark. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Brandon Oglenski : Hey, good morning everyone. Alan, I wanted to come back to intermodal pricing, because I think on the January call you did imply that you weren\u2019t going to get a lot of pricing benefit from the tight trucking market until 2022. I think you did mention a few mix impacts on yield - I think the suggestion was that those yields are going to be sustainable throughout the year, but can you talk maybe more explicitly on pricing in that market and any differences between domestic or international? Alan Shaw : Yes Brandon, what we\u2019re seeing is the pricing environment continues to improve. The truck capacity tightness we expect is going to last through this year and into next year. I was looking at something last night, and it makes sense - warehousing and trucking are pulling from the same blue collar pool out there, and you know what\u2019s going on in the warehousing market, rates are up 8% year-over-year. As people are forward positioning inventory next to the end markets, that\u2019s a tight market. In our transactional intermodal business, we are updating our price plan; however as I noted, that\u2019s a relatively small component of our overall price. I\u2019ve talked through our rate structure with our customers, and so you can see that over time we\u2019re going to exceed contract and spot rates. As I noted, it\u2019s over time. We have long term contracts, we want to make sure that we provide our channel partners, who are phenomenal at growing, with surety on their rates as they go through bid season. We take a measured approach, it takes time. Over time, it\u2019s the right thing to do for our customers and our shareholders. Brandon Oglenski : Okay, so just to clarify, it\u2019s mostly mix then that we saw on the acceleration in yields? Alan Shaw : Yes. Brandon Oglenski : Okay, and then one last quick follow-up for Cindy. Cindy, you mentioned that you guys are really focused on car velocity, which I think I can understand from your perspective; but ultimately don\u2019t your customers care about a service delivery index, or am I just not understanding that correctly? Cindy Sanborn : Well, I think we all agree that moving a car faster is good for both asset utilization and our customers, so that is really kind of a happy medium with solving all of those issues. We measure our local delivery processes, our in-transit processes as well, but ultimately if any of those break down, you\u2019re going to see that car velocity, so that\u2019s why we\u2019re focusing on that.  We have quite a bit of focus in general on serving our customers well, and Alan and I talk about that quite a bit and make sure we are aligned on that topic. Alan Shaw : Yes, Cindy\u2019s focus is on running a highly efficient, highly reliable and fluid network, and within our interactions with our customers, we have shared KPIs that are individual to those customers, not an index, so we\u2019re having conversations every day with our customers that are metrics-based on the quality of the product that we\u2019re delivering and the value we bring into the market. Mark George : It\u2019s much more granular than SDI ever is. Alan Shaw : Yes. Brandon Oglenski : Appreciate it, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, our final question this morning comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Ken Hoexter : Great, thanks for squeezing me in. Congrats on the solid job here. Cindy, a lot of information on PSR and the improvement. Where do you think you are on the path here in terms of when you step back, the hump, the flat switching? Is the major stuff done and now it\u2019s the incremental improvements? Do you still see, when you look at this, the opportunity for capital investment? You mentioned some of the sidings. Is there any other projects that you look at, that still need to be implemented to get any more step function gains, or is this just kind of maybe incrementals? Then just a side question - any real estate gains in the quarter, or plans for the year? Cindy Sanborn : Ken, I think that we still have some structural work that we need to do, whether that\u2019s from a train size perspective or continuing to move forward with some terminal efficiencies beyond the footprint that we have today, but that\u2019s going to depend on volume and where traffic wants to go. We want to make sure that we serve our customers well and we do it in an efficient, reliable way, so I think there\u2019s still more structural work to be done and then we\u2019ll, to your point, continue to tweak and refine from there. But I think I see a great opportunity ahead of us. Mark George : And Ken, let me answer your question on real estate. We had a pretty light quarter - we only had about $4 million of operating gains this year from the sale of real estate in the first quarter, and that was versus $11 million last Q1, so it was actually down $7 million year-over-year. Again, we\u2019d tell you to guide--to bookmark around $30 million to $40 million over the course of the year, and we\u2019d stick with that. There are years where we do have outsized specific items where when that happens, we\u2019ll call it out and let you know, but for the time being I\u2019d bookmark $30 million to $40 million for the year, even though we\u2019re a little shy of that run rate here in the first quarter. Ken Hoexter : Thanks Cindy and Mark. Then my follow-up, Jim, you mentioned--I would love to ask about M&A in terms of the impact on the industry, but it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re going to answer. But on the technology side, the autonomous track and car inspections, is there anything new that you\u2019re working on as we prepare? Do you think going to one-man crews is the next step in this phase? You were asked about autonomous before. Just interested in--and you mentioned a lot of step-up in tech investments, it seems like an opportunity to keep making some strides, so maybe you can follow up on the tech side James Squire : Sure, happy to. Yes, I would say broadly that our focus when it comes to technology-led productivity and efficiency gains has been on the asset base, on the track structure in particular. We\u2019ve put a lot of time and attention into automating, digitizing our track inspection protocols and accumulating that data and using it to more efficiently maintain our track. It\u2019s a huge part of our asset base, so you can understand easily why we would start there.  We have begun to extend out into other parts of what we do. We\u2019re working on automating freight car inspections using machine vision systems. We are working hard on automating our crew room, reporting for duty, how we report out the conductors\u2019 work in the yard and online of road - that gets automated, so many aspects of how we do our work in the field will be automated, put on a handheld.  We\u2019re leveraging the PTC network in a variety of ways as well, the communications network to think about automating train operations too. Next generation automated train operations presents a terrific opportunity for us to operate more efficiently and more safely, and so I\u2019ll close on that note. James Squire : I want to thank everyone for your questions this morning, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Mark George : Take care, all. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It\u2019s now my pleasure to introduce Meghan Achimasi, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Miss. Achimasi, you may now begin. Meghan Achimasi : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Please note that during today\u2019s call, we will make certain forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties and may differ materially from actual results. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. Our presentation slides are available at nscorp.com in the Investors section, along with our reconciliation of non-GAAP measures used today to the comparable GAAP measures. A full transcript and download will be posted after the call. It is now my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern Chairman, President and CEO, Jim Squires. Jim Squires : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Norfolk Southern\u2019s second quarter 2021 earnings call. Joining me today are Cindy Sanborn, Chief Operating Officer, Alan Shaw, Chief Marketing Officer and Mark George, Chief Financial Officer. Building upon our momentum to start the year, our team delivered another record setting quarter, as dramatic improvement in both revenue and volume up 34% and 25% respectively, outpaced, an 11% growth in expense, and while the year-over-year improvement is aided by easier comps from last year\u2019s economic shutdown, our performance in the quarter also improved sequentially in a number of ways as shown on Slide 4. Our results include second quarter records for net income and earnings per share and all-time records for operating income and operating ratio, which was 58.3% this quarter. We\u2019re excited to share more details about our results. But first I want to take a moment to thank each and every one of our employees for helping us run a more efficient and safer railroad while serving our customers. And I\u2019ll now turn to Cindy to go through our operations. Cindy? Cindy Sanborn : Thanks, Jim, and good morning. We accomplished a lot this quarter and I am most pleased with our PSR progress during the past several months. We continue to get more productive, face our challenges head on and seize the opportunities we are creating. In the second quarter, we saw the benefits of a structurally lower operating cost base coupled with an operation that successfully absorbed increased volumes in the networks. Turning to the operating metrics on Slide 6, you can clearly see the operating leverage generated in the quarter, leverage that flows directly to the bottom line. Our operating discipline enabled us to handle a 25% year-over-year volume increase with 8% fewer people in our workforce and a 1% decrease in active locomotives. This success shows our improvements in train size, reflecting our goal of absorbing more business into our existing operating network wherever possible and further driving productivity. These gains were achieved in part by the increased deployment of distributed power and more blending a previously separate traffic types on the same train. We will continue to unlock train size increases through targeted siding extensions on key routes, where train length is currently limited. Terminal capacity enhancements, which we\u2019ve achieved through more efficient operating practices, will also be a key factor in absorbing and processing growth on these larger trains. Increased train size promotes better fuel efficiency and our progress this quarter reflects our commitment to closing the fuel efficiency gap with our peers. Our mechanical team, which manages the maintenance of our highly reliable locomotive fleet, pulling these larger trains has been crucial to many of these accomplishments. And I\u2019ll give you more detail on that a little later in my presentation. On Slide 7, you can see in the second quarter, we showed sequential improvement in terminal dwell and train velocity, after we got through the severe winter weather in the first quarter. However, our progress was uneven and we lost ground in June, in part due to several discreet, but geographically impactful operating disruptions. We aren\u2019t satisfied with our service levels and we were working extremely hard to seize the opportunity PSR presents to recover faster from disruptions. As the graph show, we resumed our improvement in July. We are committed to continuing to improve service levels and running a faster railroad, not just because a faster railroad is a lower cost railroad, but also because speed generates capacity for us to take on additional traffic within our existing train network. I\u2019ll move to Slide 8. During the quarter, we strive to deliver a consistent service product, even with significant volume changes by focusing on the consistency and productivity of our yard and local operations. We are teaching and equipping our field managers to better measure the work, our yard and local crews do and answer some important questions. Does the number of assignments working match the cars volumes flowing through a terminal or territory? Are we getting full value out of each resource in all yards? What\u2019s the right balance of overtime costs? Where are there further automation or process opportunities to help us reduce support costs, including clerical staff and mechanical presence? We are implementing technology to provide better and more timely data to answer these questions, which helps us reduce direct operating cost and improve service consistency. In several locations, we\u2019ve renewed our focus on more efficient remote control operations, which have been facilitated by the changing nature of the work over the last year. Local operations scheduled and properly sized volumes enable us to be more predictable to our customers and move cars quickly. Having a higher balance of crews assigned to road train service while creating capacity within the terminal through process enhancements, makes us nimble when responding to market changes and reducing our fixed costs. Local service is at the core of our service product and these changes are designed to improve that product. So far, we have reduced the cost per yard in local crew 7% versus last year and expect additional progress as the year continues. In a moment, Mark will discuss the benefits of reduced headcount and employee activity levels and constraining overall compensation expense as we absorb volume. Our focus on yard and local productivity has played a pivotal role in driving those benefits. We pursue targeted initiatives, such as these with an eye towards the next generation of modern railroading, which we are bringing to life today. We continue to empower our workforce to the delivery of mobility solutions and have distributed 8,000 smartphones to our T&E employees to facilitate improved reporting and to streamline the process of keeping trains moving. In the third quarter, we will begin rolling out a next generation local train reporting application to improve our visibility and customer service for the first and last mile. We are also in the final months of deployment of our current phase of the mobile track authority application that facilitates more efficient coordination between engineering and dispatching functions for right-of-way maintenance activities. We are at a very exciting time for our company and industry, in which we have ample opportunities to drive customer and shareholder value through both operational improvements and technology, a powerful formula. Earlier I mentioned the role the mechanical team has played in our PSR success. So I thought it would be useful to explain their crucial role on Slide 9. PSR railroads Norfolk Southern included ended up needing fewer locomotives. What our mechanical department has done is to take that initial A&E and use it strategically to call the worst performing units and to make our locomotive fleet more homogeneous. Those changes unlock repair productivity. Think about the benefits of repairing newer and fewer locomotives, which drove down the number of units out of service for repair. That started a virtuous cycle of improved reliability with 175% improvement in the days between unscheduled events to a shop versus pre-PSR levels. Meaning that when units do go into the shop, our craftsmen can spend more time on preventive maintenance instead of triaging issues. This cycle repeats itself and ultimately supports the efficient movement of trains and serving our customers. Fewer more reliable units also require fewer resources. So we need fewer servicing facilities and have fewer people maintaining locomotives. This is just an example, a big example of Norfolk Southern\u2019s PSR transformation. These changes are purposely aligned with our overall fleet strategy, including investments and are fewer but better units through our DC to AC conversion, energy management solutions and predictive analytic tools for maintenance, planning, and failure prevention. When taken as a whole, the benefits of this strategy flow through our materials, fuel and compensation expense lines. While ensuring we have a robust fleet capable of supporting profitable growth. Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Alan. Alan Shaw : Thank you, Cindy, and good morning, everyone. You can see on Slide 11 that we are approaching pre-pandemic revenue levels. However, the composition of our business has changed dramatically due to the secular trends in the overall economy that were accelerated by the pandemic. Norfolk Southern is positioned at the forefront of these shifts due to the unique advantages of our powerful consumer oriented franchise and the diverse industrial markets we serve. The progress we have delivered amid dynamic business conditions underscores the value we provide to the markets we serve. Norfolk Southern\u2019s network directly connects to the majority of consumption and manufacturing in the United States, and is a vital resource for maintaining the flow of goods to support the economy. We are building on the inherent value of our network by working to provide our customers with the digital logistics solutions they need to compete and grow in an evolving market. The sustainability advantages of the Norfolk Southern franchise deliver a competitive advantage, provide customers with solutions to their carbon offset goals and are an accelerant to growth. In the second quarter of 2021, we successfully capitalized on opportunities by leveraging productivity enhancements and collaborating with our customers. As a result, second quarter revenue in our non-energy markets exceeded pre-pandemic levels by 4%. Growth this quarter was driven by consumer facing in industrial segments, which helped to offset sustain headwinds in our energy markets. Revenue and our energy related markets returned to just over two-thirds of pre-pandemic levels in the second quarter of 2021. Our market position enabled a quick recovery in consumer and industrial markets almost fully offsetting the 50% decline in our energy revenue. Despite the sharp decrease in this historically profitable segment, we reduced operating ratio, levering the strengths of our unique franchise to target segments of the $800 billion truck and logistics markets, with a sharp focus on productivity. Turning to Slide 12, our quarterly volume and revenue improves significantly from pandemic caused in all three business units, reflecting our ability to capitalize and build on the momentum of improving economic conditions. Total revenue for the quarter was $2.8 billion, up 34% year-over-year on a 25% volume improvement. Rising fuel prices and price gains drove a 7% improvement in revenue per unit, led by our intermodal franchise, which delivered record-breaking revenue per unit and revenue per unit less fuel. Sequentially, volume and revenue improved in all three business units over the first quarter in line with the accelerating economic recovery. Beginning with our merchandise segment, both volume and revenue improved 29% versus the second quarter of 2020 driven primarily by recovery from COVID-19 related shutdowns in the prior period. While automotive continued to face headwinds associated with the semiconductor chip shortage, shipments in the second quarter were up 122% year-over-year against easy comps associated with near complete shutdown of vehicle production in the second quarter of last year. Our steel franchise also delivered strong growth this quarter, up 67% as record level steel prices and elevated demand, fuel production activity. Combined gains in automotive and steel volume represented roughly 63% of total merchandise growth for the quarter. Revenue per unit was flat while revenue per unit excluding fuel declined slightly, driven by mixed headwinds in chemicals and automotive. Turning to intermodal. Our powerful franchise delivered record breaking revenue, revenue per unit and revenue per unit less fuel for the quarter. The second quarter of 2021 marks the 18th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in revenue per unit, excluding fuel for our Intermodal franchise. Strong consumer demand and tightness in the trucking sector drove growth for our domestic service product. Domestic shipments were up 17% year-over-year in the second quarter and up 4% from the same period in 2019. International shipments were also strong in the second quarter, improving 26% year-over-year on sustained high import demand, but were down 3% from the same period in 2019. Revenue per unit gains were driven by increased accessorial revenue, higher fuel surcharge revenue and price gains. Approximately 50% of the revenue per unit gain was driven by higher container storage time on terminal due to supply chain recovery challenges. Lastly, our Coal segment experienced some bright spots in the second quarter due to higher demand levels driven by global economic recovery and weather events. Coal shipments improved 55% year-over-year with strength in both the export and utility markets. Revenue per unit decreased slightly due primarily to negative mix experienced in our export markets where growth was driven by strength in the lower RPU export thermal market. Moving to our outlook on Slide 13. We expect the current economic momentum to continue through the end of the year and are raising our guidance for full year revenue growth to approximately 12% year-over-year. The overall economy continues to surprise to the upside with forecast for 2021 GDP growth now at around 7% and approximately 5% for 2022. Industrial production is forecasted to increase 6% in 2021 and north of 3% in 2020. Increased manufacturing, coupled with record low retail inventories, high savings rates and increased energy consumption, all set the stage for continued growth in the second half of the year. Merchandise growth will be led by strength in steel markets as low business inventory, the sales ratios and sustained demand for durable goods drives manufacturing activity in the second half. We are well positioned to capture opportunities associated with current strength in the steel markets as our network serves more integrated steel mills than any other railroad in North America. Merchandise energy markets will benefit from increased travel and commuting activities as businesses continue to reopen and virus restrictions are lifted. Pulp board and plastics volumes are also expected to increase as personal consumption drives demand for packaging. Merchandise gains will be partially offset by a year-over-year decline in automotive shipments in the third quarter, due to plan production downtime associated with the semiconductor shortage. Demand for international trade to support recovering global economies is expected to leave second half growth in our Intermodal franchise. Domestic intermodal demand will continue to improve as well with consumer spending and e-commerce forecast strengthening through the end of the year and ongoing capacity constraints in the trucking sector driving more opportunity for highway to rail conversions. Our Coal franchise will continue to capitalize our near-term opportunities to support global energy demand and steel production. Volume in the second half of 2021 is expected to improve year-over-year, driven by export markets benefiting from high seaborne coal prices, making U.S. coals more competitive in the global market. Demand for domestic met to support growing steel production activity is also likely to produce year-over-year growth. Gains in these markets will be partially offset by expected year-over-year declines in utility volume as this market deals with unit retirements, coal supply and plan maintenance outages. Volatility is an ever-present risk in the coal market. So we are closely monitoring geopolitical trade tensions and coal production, both of which have the potential to influence results. Overall, we expect economic conditions to be favorable for Norfolk Southern growth through the end of 2021. We are confident in our ability to leverage the strengths of our unique franchise and continue to drive revenue and margin growth. I\u2019ll now turn it over to Mark who will cover our financial results. Mark George : Thanks, Alan. On Slide 15, you see the reconciliation of our Q2 reported operating ratio and earnings per share versus 2020. The operating ratio of 58.3% represents a 1,240 basis point improvement. We had $67 million of property gains in the quarter of which there was one major transaction that closed at the end of the quarter and resulted in a $55 million gain. We view this single transaction as incremental to our normal yearly operating property gain guidance of $30 million to $40 million and it alone represents 200 basis points of the operating ratio improvement this quarter. Earnings per share of $3.28 was $1.75 higher than prior year aside from the $0.17 goodness from the property gain, there was a state tax law change that resulted in a favorable adjustment to our deferred taxes of $0.09. Moving to Slide 16. Alan walked you through the drivers of the 34% increase in revenues, including the 25% growth in volumes. At the same time, we contain growth in operating expenses to 11% as we harvested additional benefits from workforce and asset productivity. The volume growth coupled with the productivity drove strong incremental margins again this quarter resulting in an operating ratio that was a record low 58.3%, improving 1,240 basis points year-over-year and 320 basis points versus Q1, including the 200 basis point tailwind from the major property gained. Our operating income of $1.167 billion in the quarter is another record up $557 million or 91% year-over-year. And we generated free cash flow of $1.47 billion through six months also a record. And that represents an increase of $447 million or 44% versus the same six months last year. Moving now to a drill down of operating expense performance on Slide 17. You\u2019ll see that operating expenses increased $157 million or 11% and fuel was the biggest driver of the increase with price driving expenses up $83 million. Usage increased due to higher volumes, which was partially offset by another quarter of fuel efficiency gains, a 4% improvement in the quarter. The increase in purchase services and rents is driven by volumes, although we managed to keep the increase in these categories well below the volume growth rates. Comp and ben is up 6% with savings from head count being down 8% year-over-year, offsetting increases in pay rates and overtime. Higher incentive compensation in the quarter was $39 million reflecting the improved outlook for the year and low accrual rates of last year. Despite the 25% growth in volume materials were actually down year-over-year from lower spend associated with fewer, but more productive locomotives. Thanks to the rationalization of the equipment last year and the initiatives that Cindy described earlier. The big item in the materials and other column is the favorable compare on gains from property sales in Q2 and that was $67 million in the quarter versus only $2 million last year. Turning to Slide 18. You\u2019ll see that other income net of $35 million is $14 million or 29% unfavorable year-over-year due primarily to lower net returns on our company owned life insurance investments. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was only 21% lower than we typically modelled and that was primarily from the benefit associated with the state tax law change. Net income increased by 109%, while earnings per share grew 114% supported by the nearly 3.4 million shares we repurchased in the quarter. Wrapping up now with our free cash flow on Slide 19. And as I mentioned, free cash flow was a record for the six months of 2021 at $1.47 billion buoyed by very strong operating cash generation and relatively modest property additions of $627 million thus far in the year. And that translates to a free cash flow conversion of 99% through six months. Although we still expect property additions to ramp up in the balance of the year and hit our $1.6 billion guidance number. Shareholder distributions through six months exceeds $2 billion an increase of $870 million versus prior year. Thanks to our recently increased dividend and the meaningful increase in our share repurchase activity. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Jim. Jim Squires : Thank you, Mark. When we spoke last quarter, I took the opportunity to share our company\u2019s longstanding commitment to sustainability. Along those lines, I\u2019m excited to report two brand new milestones in our journey. Earlier this quarter, we became the first North American Class 1 railroad to issue a green bond, launching $500 million in green bonds to fund sustainable investments, to reduce our carbon emissions and partner with customers to do the same. As outlined in our green financing framework, potential projects range from improving locomotive fuel efficiency to fostering truck to rail conversions, powering company operations with clean energy, to increasing the use of energy efficient buildings and technology and supporting reforestation projects that restore natural landscapes and offset carbon emissions. In addition to our green bonds, we achieved another significant milestone earlier this month with the approval of our science-based target, our commitment to reduce emissions intensity by 42% in the next 15 years. These two steps are a critical part of our shared commitment to sustainability with our investors, customers, partners and communities underscoring our resolve to be an even bigger part of the solution. Before we open the call to Q&A, I\u2019ll take a moment to provide our updated outlook based on the current economic environment. As Alan mentioned, we are even more confident about growth for the balance of this year and we now expect revenue to be up approximately 12% year-over-year. Strength in our consumer-oriented and manufacturing markets will drive the majority of the growth. And the near-term upside in coal markets will provide more of a lift this year than previously expected, though the market remains challenged in the long-term. We are also succeeding in driving productivity into our operations. And as a result we got onto our 60% run rate here in the second quarter. We expect to maintain this level for the balance of the year, which translates to at least 400 basis points of our improvement for the full year versus our adjusted 2020 result. And we\u2019ll build upon this momentum for more improvements in 2022 and long-term sustained value for our shareholders and customers. So with that, we\u2019ll open the call to your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Chris Wetherbee : Yes. Thanks and good morning. Maybe if you could just pick up where you left off Jim on the guidance, particularly for the operating ratio guidance. So obviously there have been some service dynamics that have deteriorated in the quarter not just necessarily for Norfolk Southern, certainly it\u2019s more of an industry comment. But I\u2019m kind of curious how you think about resource management in the back half of the year. So it sounds like CapEx is going to ramp back up to sort of get back on run rate for the full year target. How do we think about head count? How do we think about some of the other resources that maybe you have some leverage that you can pull? And kind of how quickly do you think service can kind of ramp up? So a few questions built in there, but really kind of embedded in that OR guidance, which is obviously better than what you gave us before in the context of what we\u2019re seeing with service. Jim Squires : Good morning, Chris. Let me start, and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Cindy to talk about some of the specific actions we\u2019re taking on the workforce front. We continue to see opportunities for workforce and other productivity in the second half of the year. Yes, we are facing some spot labor shortages, but they\u2019re just that. Systemically, we think we\u2019ll manage and that we will continue to generate labor productivity in the second half, in fact. And that should translate into favorable results for expenses and for the bottom line as well. We mentioned as part of the overall OR guidance the expectation for revenue \u2013 revised expectation for revenue, we took that up some too. So you put the two together and that gets you to the new guidance on the OR, which is more than 400 basis points for the year. Cindy talk a little bit more about what we\u2019re doing on the resource side. Cindy Sanborn : Sure, Jim. Thanks, Chris. So if you think about where we started the year, we had planned to hire, it wasn\u2019t going to be broad-based, we expected to gain productivity in our workforce throughout the year and largely as played out that way. My prepared remarks go into some more detail on that. I will say that from a standpoint of hiring where we are hiring, there were a few hire group locations, the specific areas where the job market is extremely tight. And so we are experiencing that in our ability to bring on new employees. But it\u2019s fairly localized. It\u2019s not broad-based. So to mitigate that, we pull on some of our typical items that we \u2013 how we deploy people through what we call go teams, where we have employees that quickly can go into areas and support the existing crews that are there, temporary transfers, permanent transfers and even craft transfers from let\u2019s say, mechanical craft into transportation. And in terms of hiring some of the areas that we\u2019re working on there to \u2013 to be able to get people to come to us, we\u2019ve increased our training wage and we\u2019ve also have some sign-on and retention bonuses for the new employees as they come on. So we\u2019re working very diligently there. It is a headwind for us, we\u2019re watching it very, very closely. And you tied it to service and I would tell you that, our service as I think about that more broad-based and coming into the beginning of the year, we had fairly strong service measures. We went through a very challenging February and a very strong demand for volume in March on top of a really low demand for service because of the weather in February. And we started coming out of those challenges in late April and May and felt really good about where we are. As we headed into June, we had and I also described this a bit in my prepared remarks, sort of a series of events that couple of derailments, not big derailments, but just locations where they were challenging for us. And then as we\u2019re recovering from that, we had some weather events that just elongated the recovery. So June was just a challenging month. As we came out of the July holiday, July 4 holiday, we have accelerated the gains from May and the run rates that we had from May, and I feel better and good about where we are. We\u2019re not satisfied with where we are. We want to continue to improve service for our customers. But that\u2019s largely how I see the dynamic here between resources and service. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of John Saager with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. John Saager : Thank you. Good morning. Alan, everybody knows about the chip shortage and the impact it\u2019s having on the auto industry. But your comments about being down year-over-year in 3Q, maybe a bit surprising just given your network has been a little bit more immune, given the heavy SUV exposure there. Can you speak to your expectations beyond 3Q especially as you get into that 12% increase in volumes for the full year for the total network? What are you expecting from auto? Is there a massive snap back there where the second half kind of looks the same, even though the third quarter may be a little bit lighter? And how does that kind of pretend into next year\u2019s view on the auto market? Alan Shaw : John, the semiconductors are certainly the headline issue. What we\u2019re seeing right now is the impact of the delta variant on producers who are our suppliers, I should say, in Southeast Asia. And so we\u2019ve got a couple of plants that source parts from Southeast Asia and because of issue \u2013 production issues over there, they\u2019ve had to pull forward planned production downtime later this year. And so that has had an impact on our production and our volumes right now. Over time, we feel like we\u2019re going to get back to all the plants operating in August, but John, you know that we\u2019ve talked about that before and had to push it back. And we\u2019re still anticipating by the fourth quarter, we\u2019re going to be in a position where we\u2019re at full production. You\u2019re right, the plants that we serve and the products that we move are in high demand. So they will be the ones that get the first call on any available parts, whether it\u2019s semiconductors or anything else. Right now finished vehicle inventories to normalize sales are in the teens. It\u2019s probably about a third or a fourth of where our customers want them. And so, we serve more U.S. vehicle production than anybody else, and we serve an industry that\u2019s going to be very interested on inventory rebuild both this year and as we move into next year. So we\u2019re pretty confident about the trajectory of our auto franchise once we kind of whether this initial bump. John Saager : Okay. So just to be clear that the 12% total volume growth is that including a \u201cmade whole\u201d on auto or that\u2019s in spite of auto maybe being weaker than you thought. Alan Shaw : Yes. I\u2019m glad you brought that up. It is 12% revenue growth, upper single digit volume growth. John Saager : Right. Yes. Okay, great. Thank you, Alan. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Justin Long : Thanks and good morning. On the OR guidance just wanted to clarify, are you including the $55 million gain on sale and the expectation for 400 to 440 basis points of year-over-year improvement. And then maybe just thinking beyond even the second half of this year, we\u2019d love to get your thoughts about incremental margins going forward as we look into 2022 and beyond, and think about the opportunity beyond the 60% OR. Jim Squires : Mark, why don\u2019t you take that one? Mark George : Sure. Look, Justin, the guidance does include it\u2019s all in. So it does include this major property gain that we called out or highlighted for you. And look, I think incrementals, we had very, very strong incrementals here in the first half. And the guidance implies we\u2019re going to continue to have very strong instrumentals in the back half, albeit, less than the first half. We do have some unique headwinds here in this second half that would include things like fuel. Fuel is a headwind to us, a lot of the incremental revenue that we\u2019re adding here in our guidance change is coming from fuel. So it\u2019s fuel surcharge, which is mitigating incremental fuel expense. So there\u2019s really no incremental margin from that. So it tends to dilute what we have organically in the back half. And then on top of that, we will have some diminishing accessorial charges, which hopefully help fuel some more volume that comes with it. And of course, we\u2019ve got some IC headwind here in the back half as well. But that said incrementals are good and we continue to believe that going into 2022, we will continue to improve our OR on an incremental basis. And buoyed by some of the productivity initiatives and measures that we\u2019re constantly looking at and sending our team or iterating on the T&E side, as well as fuel efficiency that should help, again, provide us consistent and continued improvement in our overall OR quest. Justin Long : Okay. Appreciate the time. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Thomas Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Thomas Wadewitz : Yes. Good morning. I wanted to ask you a little bit about intermodal. I guess, the first component just being, how do you think about the storage fees? I think you alluded to them being a pretty big factor in revenue per unit growth in intermodal. Do you think they continue at that level in third quarter, second half? Is that a big fall off in that? And I guess related to that, how do you think about the terminal operations? Are you constraining volume into Chicago and kind of what\u2019s the chassis impact on your fluidity and how you think that may \u2013 how quickly that may change in terms of capacity constraints. Thank you. Alan Shaw : You\u2019re welcome, Tom. Our accessorial programs are designed to align the mutual goals in our customers for more efficient and reliable service product. And with a pressure on the drayage community and the pressure on warehousing due to pandemic protocols and labor shortages, our customers in certain locations needed more space for storage. And so we responded to the market, we\u2019ve added satellite lots in some areas we\u2019ve reconfigured our stack configuration at Landers our heavily international facility in Chicago. And we\u2019ve been able to accommodate a lot more international units dwelling on our terminals because that\u2019s what our customers need. Our accessorials in this case are an activity-based service and price that that we apply to the market. We are absolutely focused on programs that encourage the fluidity of our operations and really our hope clearly is that the accessorials go away because that means that customers are pulling more quickly from our terminals. And as soon as customers pull boxes from our terminals, we can inbound more boxes into our terminals. It\u2019s not an issue of capacity. It\u2019s an issue of throughput and we\u2019re working on some programs to encourage dual missions with the drayage community. So anytime that they get a box, they\u2019re out getting a box as well. You mentioned chassis, I\u2019m glad you brought that up. As you know that about six weeks ago, we determined that over 5,100 of our chassis had a manufacturing defect, it was a supplier issue. And with our uncompromising commitment to safety, we didn\u2019t hesitate to pull those off the street. Now that happened in a tough environment. We were already short of chassis because of a long gated street, well associated with the same warehouse and same drayage community pressures that I noted before. I\u2019m very proud of the way that we have responded and frankly, in collaboration with our customers as well. We stood up a number of different locations, an entire network of vendors to repair these chassis the brand new process, we\u2019ve got 80 different locations in which we are repairing chassis. Some of them are even off of our network and we\u2019re working with foreign roads our Western partners on a number of gateway locations. As a result, we\u2019ve already repaired 40% of our chassis just in the first six weeks. Right now we\u2019re on a run rate where we\u2019re repairing about 10% of those affected chassis. And we fully believe that by the end of August, we will have repaired about three quarters of the effect chassis, which are effectively anything that\u2019s on our network. The rest have kind of migrated off network and we\u2019re working with the foreign roads to get that back \u2013 those back to us, so that we can repair them. We haven\u2019t closed gates. I want to make it very clear. What we\u2019re doing in certain lanes where we \u2013 at the destination we have a shortage of chassis because of this safety recall, we are metering or capping volume. And every day this improves, because every day we\u2019re repairing chassis, putting them back into the market and we are relaxing the metering program. You can see the impact on our volumes sequentially as you move out of May into the first half of June, and then where we are now. And as we continue to repair the chassis, you\u2019ll see volumes pick up. Thomas Wadewitz : Are you optimistic that improvement is quick or is that going to slow? I think that\u2019s kind of underlying what I was asking. Alan Shaw : Improvement in volumes. Thomas Wadewitz : Throughput. Yes, you said throughput is the key, would you expect quick improvement in throughput or is that pretty gradual throughout the second half? Alan Shaw : Well, it\u2019s going to improve as we get more chassis back into the market. As I told you, we\u2019re going to have about three quarters of these, all the ones that are on our network repaired by the end of August. We\u2019re also starting this September, we\u2019re going to inject more of these out of the lease market into our network as well. So we are applying capacity to the growth opportunities that are out there for our customers. Thomas Wadewitz : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott Group : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Mark, wanted to ask you about some of the cost lines. We saw a step up in purchase services and comp for employee in the second quarter. How should we think about that going forward from here? And then similarly, Alan, merchandise and coal RPU was, they were both down sequentially, any thoughts on how to think about that into the back half of the year? Thank you. Mark George : Hey, Scott, let me \u2013 first I\u2019ll tackle comp and ben for employee. It did step up a little bit here in the second quarter. Frankly, we ended up hitting our 60% OR a quarter or two earlier than we thought to get on that run rate, led us to increase our outlook for the year on operating ratio. And I think as you know, our incentive plan is heavily oriented toward OR improvement. So that resulted in an increase to incentive comp accruals beyond what we had initially guided. So you see about an 8% \u2013 well, sorry, 16% increase in the quarter year-over-year in comp and ben for employee. About half of that is from the incentive, the rest is really split between wage inflation over time, payroll taxes. So now I think when you look at the balance of the year, just look at it on an absolute comp for employee basis. First half is roughly around 33,000, between the first quarter, second quarter. And I think it\u2019s going to end up being pretty much in that territory in the back half as well, around 33,000, so pretty specific number there. Purchase services, it did step up. I think we guided you that it would step up. At Q1 it was more of an anomalous drop. There was some deferral of expenses. We were slow out of the gate on some spend. So I do think where we ended the second quarter was in line with what we expected. I do expect a modest pickup here in the balance of the year. For Q3 and Q4 we\u2019re containing it, it\u2019ll be less than revenue growth. But probably a little bit of a modest pickup in the back half, as some of the engineering expenses step up here during the summer months and into the fall. And also some of the IT spend will be coming through in the back half. Alan Shaw : The question Scott was on RPU. We are exceeding our price plan that we had established at the end of the year, and we delivered 7% RPU growth for the quarter, despite negative mix in each of our three business units. Within merchandise, Rock Salt was up about 40%. We\u2019re happy to handle the business, but that\u2019s generally lower rated business. PIH, which is a very high rated business was down in the quarter year-over-year. But also within the auto industry, you know how disrupted individual plants have been because of these production issues or supplier issues, I should say. And just as a result of plants that took some downtime, our auto length of haul was down significantly in the second quarter, which impacted overall RPU. And I\u2019ll pivot over to coal, you referenced that and that really is continues to be a function of mix. And I guided to that, that that would be pressure going forward within our export thermal market volume was up 250% year-over-year. We\u2019ve got a really good service product in that lane. And we\u2019re leveraging that to the benefit of our customers and to our shareholders. At the same time, export thermal is up 250%, which as you know is lower rated export met was up 20%. So we handled growth there in any given year we\u2019d be very happy with 20% growth. But that just creates severe negative mix. Frankly, within export last year, three quarters of our business was met this year. It was a 50-50. So there you can see the impact on RPU. Scott Group : Okay. Thank you, guys. Jim Squires : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Brandon Oglenski : Good morning, everyone and thanks for taking my question. Cindy, I guess, I was \u2013 I wanted to talk about network velocity because it does look like you\u2019re running pretty well below where you\u2019ve gotten in 2019 and even early 2020, obviously with less volumes. But can you talk about your road service redesign and how that could be improving things. But is the mix impacting that aggregated number as well? Cindy Sanborn : Yes. Brandon, so let me start kind of at a high level. I really see we\u2019ve got some very strong building blocks in place. We\u2019ve continued to bring on some talent with PSR experience and Hunt Cary who was running our operations efficiency team has now added to his portfolio of responsibility to include our network operations center. So we have that going for us. We have longer term siding extensions that are going to allow us to continue to grow trains. We are still growing train length, as you heard in my prepared remarks. But there\u2019s still some work to do from a consolidation perspective on our line of road. I do think that that should be a benefit to us because it unlocks capacity, the fewer trains that we have out there and we\u2019re working every day to be better. So as I think about it in a more short-term view, we\u2019re working every day to be better. Our recruits have come down substantially in July. And as I think about even from a capacity perspective, I\u2019ll give you this kind of data point. Last quarter, I talked about the fact that on our intermodal trains at about 10% running above 10,000 feet. That\u2019s actually the same number this quarter even with the train size increases that we\u2019ve seen. So we\u2019re actually starting with this smaller stuff and being able to put that together. And then as we grow the sidings, we\u2019ll be able to even do more. And again, that just unlocks capacity on line of road. So I see bright future here longer-term and then medium-term again, it\u2019s just basic blocking and tackling. And I think Hunt being in the NSC has brought some different thoughts into that work group. And I think we\u2019re seeing those benefits already in July. Brandon Oglenski : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your questions. Bascome Majors : Yes. Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to talk a little bit about intermodal pricing. I know much of that is on long-term contracts and there are some standard escalators in there. But can you talk a little bit, is there a lag benefit where you really do see a lot of what\u2019s happening in the truckload market and your pricing in 2022? Or will that be similar year-over-year? Just any thoughts on how you get paid for how the truckers are getting paid today would be helpful. Thank you. Alan Shaw : Bascome, there is a lag in our long-term contracts on intermodal price. And so we would expect next year to see more improvement and year-over-year price. Then we see this year on some of those deals. And I\u2019ll just reiterate, we\u2019re not going to see a huge uptick like you see in the spot market. We just are not structured to chase the spot market, either up or down, we take a much more measured approach with our customers. They\u2019re looking for rate surety as they go out into bid season. We want them to be successful. We\u2019re aligning with the best channel partners in the business. They\u2019re focused on growth, and we\u2019re here to support that growth over time that has generated rate increases in intermodal that exceed both the contract market and the spot market within truck. And as I talked about, we\u2019ve got 18 straight quarters of year-over-year growth and RPU less fuel in intermodal both ended up markets and down. So expect a continued improvement as we move through next year. We don\u2019t expect the kind of volatility that you\u2019re seeing in the spot market. Bascome Majors : I appreciate it. And I\u2019m actually curious to your point about the long-term bias with these partnerships. Has this environment changed the conversation about how you want to convert traffic long-term and work with your partners to do that? I\u2019m just curious, what might be different two to three years down the road? Alan Shaw : There are a number of trends that were in place that we believe were accelerated by the pandemic that includes more interest in rail, forward positioning of inventory, shifts from highway to rail. There\u2019s a number of reasons, sustainability. Jim talked about that that is definitely entering into a conversation with our customers. And in the intermodal space with our channel partners, that\u2019s helping them win business as well. I look at our industrial development activities and compared to just two or three years ago, and there was a lot more interest in economic development in rail serve sites. So yes, there is more and more activity, more and more discussion in both the merchandise and in the intermodal sphere for highway to rail conversions. And that\u2019s frankly, the way that we\u2019ve positioned our franchise. That\u2019s why we\u2019re so confident about the future. Bascome Majors : Thank you for that color. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Amit Mehrotra : Thanks, operator. Hi everybody, good morning. Alan, just following up on the chassis discussion, I understand I guess the cost to fix the problem is not very material, but I think it\u2019s 15% of the owned fleet for the company. So just for my own curiosity, is there any recourse or claim the customer has if they\u2019re not able to move the boxes out of the terminals due to chassis availability, or is this maybe an issue for that impacts really your channel partners? If you can just give us some color on that. And then just as a follow-up Mark, you\u2019ve been super helpful in the past on OpEx cadence. You\u2019re kind of highlighting some step up in OpEx ex-fuel. Wondering if you could just help us put a finer point on that in the back half relative to the first half of the second quarter, revenue looks like it\u2019s going to be maybe sequentially down a little bit in the back half or flattish at best. So just wondering what the corresponding increase in OpEx ex-fuel we should expect on the back of that. Thank you very much. Alan Shaw : Amit, our primary focus is on safety and our primary focus is on injecting capacity to help our customers grow. As the downstream impact associated with this supplier issue is fluid and it\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019m not going to comment on that right now. Mark George : Yes. And Amit, just \u2013 the 12% revenue guidance kind of implies, you\u2019re going to see them flattish to maybe modestly down a little in the back half. And in terms of OpEx, I think, fuel is one of the variables where that continues to creep up here in the back half. And then as I mentioned, I think the comp and ben per employee is kind of just that will stabilize and be at that 33,000 per level. Other than that, we do see a little bit of a step up, like I said to Scott on purchased services, a modest step up there. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see continued diminishing material spend. I think we\u2019re kind of hitting a bottom there that will probably be more flattish and rents, I think there will be some pressure as volumes are coming back, there\u2019s a little bit of a lag usually with equipment rents. And I think especially if autos, when auto starts to come back, we\u2019ll see a little bit of pressure on rents from where we are right now. Amit Mehrotra : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And Alan, just maybe if I can approach, I respect, you don\u2019t want to comment on it. But maybe I can approach the question in different way. Do you think the impact of this chassis shortage is primarily a volume and service impact that rebounds, when you finish, when the company finishes addressing these issues? Or is there some idiosyncratic cost issue as well that maybe is meeting some of the results that can unwind over the course of the next couple of quarters? Alan Shaw : Yes, we\u2019ve been \u2013 we\u2019ve stated that the revenue and the cost impact is not material for us to call out. We are intently focused on standing up a new program, repairing these chassis, serving our customers and injecting more assets into the network so that we can help them grow. And we got a great plan to do that. We responded very quickly to this issue. Amit Mehrotra : Okay. All right. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question will be coming from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Jordan Alliger : Yes. Just longer term, thinking about intermodal, can you maybe talk to or give an update on your thoughts about East Coast versus West Coast ports and some of the issues around the West Coast, maybe even stimulated further conversations, people making more of a shift retailers, et cetera, to the east side. Thanks. Alan Shaw : Jordan, we saw or we\u2019ve continued to see kind of a measured shift in market share from West Coast, the East Coast, and that\u2019s due to over the last 10, 15 years, that\u2019s due to a number of issues widening the Suez canal, labor strife on the West Coast, then 2014 widening of the Panama canal, and just basically East Coast, is where you\u2019re seeing a lot of growth in population and consumption. We\u2019re very fortunate that our franchise serves a majority of the consumption and the manufacturing in the United States. And so, yes, we fully expect that our ports, which are very active in attracting new business. We\u2019ll continue to do so. And that\u2019s going to continue to be strength for our unique intermodal franchise. Jordan Alliger : All right, thanks so much. Operator : The next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Ken Hoexter : Great. Good morning. Jim and Mark, maybe just a little clarification, a great outlook on the 400 to 440 basis points of margin improvement, can you clarify, did you say before Jim, that you were going to stay at the 58 through the rest of the year? I thought you mentioned something about holding these levels? And then just kind of wrapping up with what you\u2019ve just talked about on the last couple of answers. You\u2019re kind of fighting the tide with higher fuel surcharge, which is 100% OR, you\u2019ve got the bump now from the real estate games, incentive comp challenges. So are you looking for a step up in any of the segments in order to get further gains from that two these levels, I\u2019m just trying to understand if we\u2019re looking for any additional gains or if there are real estate gains that are coming or any or is it just the benefits maybe from the higher revenues? Thanks. Jim Squires : Thanks, Ken. I\u2019ll take the first part of that. The guidance was that we would maintain the 60% run rate in the second half, which puts us for the full year where we had expected to be, but ahead of schedule, having gone to that mark in the second quarter. Mark? Mark George : Yes. So Ken, just putting a finer point on things, I mean, we don\u2019t expect gains like this to happen again in the back half. So it\u2019s really maintaining the levels, ex-gains is basically implicitly what we\u2019re trying to guide to here. Ken Hoexter : Wonderful. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Brian Ossenbeck : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. One for Cindy, can you just give us a little more context on the yard and local productivity? It seems like it\u2019s a recent effort for both service and on the cost side. How far along are you into this process? Is there any way you can kind of size that up for us? You mentioned you\u2019re getting some headcount reduction benefits from that, but what else do you mostly see potentially coming from this effort and maybe you can help with how long \u2013 how far along you are with executing this initiative? Cindy Sanborn : Yes. So thanks for the question. Yes, so the team has done a really great job with our operations efficiency team out here, really fine tuning our processes in our operating practices, if you will, within our terminal footprint. And so you\u2019ve seen again broadly the transition from humping to flat switching, which has been \u2013 which has occurred in 2019 and into 2020. And now we\u2019re fine tuning processes in other terminals, as well as our big four humps that are left. So it\u2019s essentially a very, very detailed process around matching big blocks of cars to outbound trains with the shortest amount of time between those big blocks being processed to departure, it\u2019s small things like that. But then to other things that we\u2019ve been working on as well, that with the ability to generate the capacity that we have in our terminals, particularly let\u2019s talk about Elkhart. We\u2019ve actually been able to take in volume that traditionally we had bypass to an immediate switching carriers in Chicago for forwarding to Western destinations. We\u2019ve been able to take those cars into our terminal and make direct connections to our Western carriers, our Western partners with traffic. So it\u2019s really twofold. It is a matter of fining \u2013 fine tuning processes and generating more productivity because we need less crews against the work in the terminal, as well as freeing up capacity in the terminal to bring more work into our higher powered humps that save us in this case, intermediate switching charges with Western folks. So it\u2019s pretty broad based just to what we\u2019re working on. And we will find opportunities as we look to reduce footprints at some of our smaller terminals, so it also \u2013 and also thinking about it, driving service reliability for our customers, because we\u2019re much more consistent as we work on this effort. So it\u2019s fairly broad based. Brian Ossenbeck : All right. Thanks for that, Cindy. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Ravi Shanker : Thanks. So I just want to follow-up on the intermodal side in the near term. I mean, some of your peers on conference calls this season has said that the current service issues makes it hard to drive incremental truck to rail conversion at this point, kind of do you see things the same way? And if you don\u2019t kind of \u2013 do you see incremental share opportunities to date intermodal share from your rail peers. Thank you. Alan Shaw : Ravi, as I talked to our intermodal channel partners, one of their primary concerns is overall capacity. They absolutely want to shift business from highway to rail. They are concerned about the overall throughput throughout the supply chain. And frankly, we\u2019re a big part of that, right? And I am confident that as our network fluidity improves, as we resolve these chassis issues as the drayage community, productivity improves as warehousing productivity improves then and we\u2019re going to be able to grow more, because there\u2019s a phenomenal opportunity out there. And our channel partners are starting to talk a lot more confidently about next year as well. So there\u2019s a lot of runway to the macro environment for us. And we\u2019re intent on addressing the issues that are within our control and working with our channel partners on things that we can do to help them grow. Ravi Shanker : Okay, thanks. A very quick follow-up, did you quantify the accessorial in the quarter at all relative to a normal run rate and got a part of me think about that going forward. Alan Shaw : What we said that is about half of the improvement in RPU within intermodal as associated with the activity-based service that we provide, which is accrued under the accessorial program. Mark George : Incremental accessorial versus last year. Alan Shaw : Yes. Ravi Shanker : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Fadi Chamoun with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Fadi Chamoun : Good morning. Thank you. Maybe a question for Jim, I mean, if I look across the industry, there\u2019s at least two franchises in a rail with a strong indexation to intermodal and these franchises have had a really tough time over the years to achieve and sustain below 60% operating ratio. And I think they attribute that to the intermodal business overall being a little bit more margin diluted compared to other. So my question is, as we kind of now hit that 60% mark, and you start to kind of look beyond that. What is unique about NSC\u2019s intermodal franchise that would allow it to achieve and sustain lower than 60% OR. And secondly, has this pandemic kind of changed maybe the competitive positioning of intermodal versus the other modes and maybe helping make a better line of sight on the 60% OR on a sustained basis. Jim Squires : Thank you, Fadi. Let me first start by saying that we\u2019re not done. We are \u2013 we have more upside, more room to run when it comes to productivity and growth. So we hit the 60% run rate mark in the second quarter. We\u2019re proud of that. And we got there ahead of schedule and that\u2019s due to the hard work of all of our employees. But we\u2019re not resting on ORs. We\u2019ll continue to push. Now, one of the clear growth engines for our company and for the industry generally is intermodal. And I will say this, the economics of the intermodal business are vastly improved from what they were say 10 years ago. There\u2019s been a lot of work done, hard work done inside our company and in partnership with our companies to really drive the value proposition in intermodal. So there\u2019s lots of opportunity there for incremental margin and improvement in the operating ratio from growth in intermodal volumes going forward. And of course, the same goes for other parts of our business as well, where the incrementals are also excellent. So I think we have a winning formula all in all, growth, opportunities certainly in intermodal and certain parts of merchandise as well, coupled with a continued focus on productivity throughout the company. Fadi Chamoun : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Walter Spracklin : Thanks so much. Good morning, everyone. So just keeping on the intermodal capacity question, looking back pre-pandemic you guys were hitting about an 85,000 per month carload basis on intermodal and obviously dipping down during the pandemic, but coming right back up in the fourth quarter, again, hitting that 85,000 and then coming back down from that again. So my question here is understand the chassis issue and the efforts there, but given what appeared at least to be given those data is there anything longer or more fundamental from a structural standpoint that you\u2019re looking at outside of chassis that will open up your intermodal capacity after this chassis issue is completed? What would be your growth potential in intermodal after that issue is resolved by your best estimate over the next year or two? Alan Shaw : So Walter, you\u2019ve got chassis route safety recall issue that I\u2019ve highlighted. You also have the overall chassis, whether it\u2019s our chassis, our customers\u2019 chassis, the international grade for chassis and box issue. That\u2019s associated with stress on the drayage community and warehousing. When that gets resolved, when that starts to improve and it\u2019s three times decrease by 20%, which is what they\u2019ve been elevated by, then you\u2019re going to see more throughput through the old entire intermodal supply chain ecosystem. With respect to our overall capacity, what we\u2019re doing about it, as we improve our odd time performance at our train network, it allows our customers to schedule their appointments with more specificity, which will help them improve their overall equipment utilization. We\u2019re continuing to invest in our terminals, both physically and with technology to make our terminals more efficient, both for us and for our customers. We\u2019re rolling out a terminal based operating system for intermodal this year, which will help us improve. And we\u2019re working with our lift contractors on how we can help each other improve and make sure we\u2019re all looking at the same sorts of service metrics. So there\u2019s a number of ways in which we can all drive improvements and gains in the intermodal volumes. I\u2019ll tell you that based on our conversations with our customers we\u2019re looking at multiples of GDP growth over the long-term and that\u2019s effectively what we\u2019ve been delivering over the last 10 or 15 years as well. Cindy Sanborn : And I also think steel will interchange, and it\u2019s has been a benefit to us here as we work with our Western partners to take pressure off the terminals in Chicago and having to drop boxes and drag them across town. So that\u2019s another area that we\u2019d love to see continue into growth. And it helps both parties to be more efficient. Alan Shaw : Yes. So Cindy\u2019s highlighting another area in which we\u2019re operating within the entire supply chain ecosystem in order to improve efficiency and fluidity. Walter Spracklin : So when this bottleneck of the chassis comes off, you see clear path of getting, I think I said monthly, I meant weekly volumes of north 85,000 on the intermodal side. And timeframe for the chassis issue overall, is that 1Q, two quarters, three quarters? Alan Shaw : Walter, I think you\u2019re talking about the street dwell for the chassis. Is that right? Walter Spracklin : Yes. Yes. Alan Shaw : I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know when that gets resolved. I mean, that is a labor issue and that\u2019s a pandemic protocol issue. Walter Spracklin : Yes. Understood. Okay. No, I know that\u2019s a tough one to understand. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Allison Landry : Thanks. Good morning. Jim, I wanted to ask about the regulatory environment. Obviously, we have the executive order or the push for reciprocal switching, but also Chairman Oberman has recently expressed concerns about intermodal terminal congestion from your edge as well as whether the rails have sufficient resources in labor in order to meet demand. So could you comment on this and whether you\u2019re concerned about the risks with the broader regulatory backdrop becomes more onerous or challenging and to the extent that you do have concerns, how might you plan to address these to the STB? Thank you. Jim Squires : Sure, sure. Thank you, Allison. I\u2019ll get to your question about competition policy in our industry in just a minute. But I think it\u2019s worth pointing out to start with that our operations, our business model overlaps nicely with many of the administration\u2019s priorities, and we are very much in sync with what the administration is trying to achieve more broadly. So for example, sustainability as we\u2019ve talked about for a long time, and we talked about today, we are the green form of ground transportation pound for pound, mile for mile, we can handle freights more efficiently using less fuel and emitting less carbon than any other form of transportation. So there\u2019s that. And we\u2019re building on it. I hope you noted the publication of our science-based, our proof science-based target. The green bonds that we issued and many other measures that will be detailed in our ESG report that should come out shortly. Secondly, the administration and Congress are both very interested in infrastructure. Look no further than the rail industry for infrastructure that is in top shape. That\u2019s next to the private investment. That\u2019s been made over many years in infrastructure. So we excel there and what we\u2019re doing is very much in line with what the administration and Congress want to achieve. And third, the majority \u2013 the great majority of our jobs are good paying union jobs to quote the President. So there too, we are a heavily unionized industry. The jobs pay well, they\u2019re good jobs and we\u2019re hiring. So that too lines up nicely with the administration\u2019s priorities. In terms of the STB, first, look, most of what we handle is truck competitive. And most of the freight that\u2019s on our railroad will move by truck, if we move rates above the truck competitive level. For freight, we handle that is less truck competitive. There exists many mechanisms before the STB to challenge the rates and to adjudicate their fairness and the customers utilize those mechanisms all the time. So there\u2019s a way to challenge what we\u2019re doing before the STB, it works for the customers are familiar with it. The STB is familiar with it. It rests on a very sound policy framework. There\u2019s a lot of precedent. And so it\u2019s working and we don\u2019t believe the STB will take measures to change all of that. In the end, the STB has looked reciprocal switching in the past and has concluded a number of times that it\u2019s not the right solution for the industry, would create severe operational disruption. And that\u2019s not good for customers. That\u2019s not good for the railroads. That\u2019s not good for passenger trains either. So in the end, I think, they may invite evidence on that once again, as they have several times in the past. But I think they\u2019ll conclude that that\u2019s not the right measure of the mechanisms that are already in place to determine whether rates are competitive or the best that we have. So thank you. Allison Landry : Thank you. Operator : Final question for today is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. David Vernon : Thanks for squeezing me in here. Alan, two quick ones\u2019 for you. Can you comment on the trend in the intermodal RPU sort of ex-fuel and the fee increase and what some of the drivers might\u2019ve been there? And then the second question is really around sort of utility coal, you mentioned is going to be down for the back half of the year. Are we kind of hitting a bottom in as you think about it in a three-year view? Or do we see \u2013\u2013 as you think about the retirement pipeline that\u2019s ahead of you, is there still further kind of room for that to bleed out into 2022, 2023? Alan Shaw : So David, the trend on intermodal RPU ex-fuels, as I noted, we\u2019ve got what 4.5 years of quarterly growth year-over-year in that. So I expect that to continue. We, as I noted before, based on our contract structure, we\u2019re going to have a lot of support for pricing into a market next year, not only because the market\u2019s strong next year, but right now intermodal rates lag truck pretty significantly. So there\u2019s a lot of head room for us and as our service product improves there\u2019s going to be even more demand for what we\u2019re putting out there. With respect to utility coal, we\u2019ve got some specific unit outages or retirements on our system. That\u2019s going to impact year-over-year comps. We\u2019ve got some plan maintenance. And then frankly, it\u2019s an issue of overall coal supply. Coal production in United States this year is projected to be down 18% compared to just it\u2019s 2018. There are some unsold tons out there from the producers, but we\u2019re not sure if those are going to go export or domestic with the export thermo markets so hot with API to well above $100. Then there\u2019s a lot of pull for that product overseas. If that happens, we\u2019ll continue to handle it. And that\u2019s was one of the \u2013 certainly one of the drivers of our significant growth in our export franchise in the second quarter. David Vernon : All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session, and I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Mr. Jim Squires for closing comments. Jim Squires : Thank you everyone for your questions today. And we look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Have a good day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may now disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Meghan Achimasi Senior Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. Ms. Achimasi, please go ahead. Meghan Achimasi : Thank you and good morning, everyone. Please note that during today's call, we will make certain forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties and may differ materially from actual results. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. Our presentation slides are available at nscorp.com in the Investors section.  Along with our reconciliation of non-GAAP measures used today to the comparable GAAP measures. Along those lines, recall that in the third quarter of 2020, we recorded an impairment charge of 99 million related to an equity method investment. So, we will speak to the quarterly results, excluding that charge. A full transcript and downloads will be posted after the call. It is now my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's Chairman, President and CEO, Jim Squires. Jim Squires : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Norfolk Southern's third quarter 2021 earnings call. Joining me today are Cindy Sanborn, Chief Operating Officer, Alan Shaw, Chief Marketing Officer, and Mark George, Chief Financial Officer. Our third quarter results reflect a strong performance from the team. As we delivered third quarter records for operating ratio, net income, income from railway operations, and earnings per share. While volume held steady with last year, revenue grew an impressive 14%.  And our 60.2% operating ratio reflects a 230 improvement on a year-over-year adjusted basis. Our second best or our performance ever outpaced only by last quarter's 58.3% mark. In the midst of significance supply chain disruptions in labor shortages across the country, we're delivering upon our commitments. And we could not have achieved those milestones without the tireless work of our employees, who day-in and day-out keep our customers goods moving, safely and efficiently. To our employees, thank you for your efforts to keep our economy moving. Now let's turn to Cindy to go through our operations, Cindy. Cindy Sanborn : Thanks, Jim, and good morning. In the quarter, we continue to successfully drive productivity improvement throughout the network. We work to be as efficient as possible as we adjusted to accommodate demand shifts and many of our markets. This quarter shows continued progress as we attack our cost structure while positioning ourselves for further improvement in both cost and service levels. The quarterly operating metrics on slide 6 clearly show that once again, we generated positive operating leverage on flat unit volumes and GTMs that were up 5%. While we're proactively hiring train crews, efficiency in all areas of our operations, including engineering, mechanical, and communications and signals enabled us to run the network with 7% fewer people in the quarter compared to a year ago.  Because assets drive activity, reducing the number of active locomotives was an important lever in managing the size of the workforce. Both train weight and train length continue to improve, driven by a focus on improving the productivity in our bulk network. Coal, grain and other single commodity unit trains offer real opportunity for gains through collaborating with our customers on operating trains with more cars per set and by doubling up existing trains over portions of their route. I expect we will show continued progress in the fourth quarter as we see the fruits of our efforts.  While strong coal traffic helped drive train weight more than length, train length continued to improve and set another quarterly record. After seven consecutive quarters of fuel efficiency improvements, we saw a modest deterioration this quarter despite the increase in train size as our horsepower leverage was challenged at times due to volatile traffic flows and we had modestly fewer of the very heavy, highly fuel-efficient trains. I'm pushing the team to respond more quickly in the phase of change and we're committed to closing the gap with our peers over time and are redoubling our efforts in this critical area.  As you can see on Slide 7, train speed and terminal dwell were generally flat versus second quarter and do not reflect performance at desired levels. While there were some effects from Hurricane Ida, those impacts were localized and I'm extremely proud of how the team, specially engineering and our signal forces helped us return our routes in Louisiana to operation and reopen the New Orleans gateway very quickly. As I mentioned last quarter, we are experiencing hiring and retention conditions that are increasingly challenging, especially in some of our more critical locations, and it is having an impact on our network.  Despite hiring all year long, attrition has been accelerating in each of the last two quarters in several of those critical areas. In many of these locations, we've been able to absorb the impact by executing upon productivity initiatives and this will be very much a part of the equation going forward as we grow capacity, which I'll talk about more in a moment. Some of the things we're doing to create relief, we've more than tripled our conductor trainee rank since the first quarter so that we can effectively back fill in critical areas.  We've implemented tools such as perfect attendance bonuses, referral bonuses, and signing incentives to improve the stickiness of our current and future workforce. And we continue to leverage the valuable go teams to quickly respond to business opportunities where needed. People are the backbone of the railroad, and we need to make progress on these initiatives to better manage the effects of a tight labor market. We are committed to having the right amount of resources in the right place at the right time, which will drive both cost control and service quality.  As our business mix continues to evolve, creating capacity across our market segments has become an even more significant area of focus as highlighted on slide 8. Some shippers are looking to take advantage of unexpected market opportunities by shipping extra volume. Others are looking for us to help them adjust to volatility coming from other parts of their supply chains and of course, all place a high value and service predictability. We're adjusting our network and operations to generate the various types of capacity that customers are looking for. For example, increases in both train sizes gives shippers extra lift without further demands on our crew base.  Train size increases often require connecting railroads, customers, and Norfolk Southern to change processes and we have found those process changes are worth the effort because they improve asset turns and capacity. We also continue to focus on terminal efficiency, whether helping to drive dwell at our biggest [Indiscernible] yard, Elkhart, to very low levels or tactically redirecting trains to intermodal terminals that have the capacity to unload quickly. Moving to Slide 9, I want to show how we can use these capacity efforts to drive productivity. We've had great success over the past two years driving train size. And in doing so, have addressed a handful of infrastructure bottlenecks. Fast-tracking instead of siding improvements the first of which went into service at the end of the third quarter so we can keep making progress. Bigger trains unlocked by siding extensions helped drive locomotive utilization because it allows us to fully match train size to available pulling power. And because locomotives are at their most efficient when pulling hard, this is a key level to our fuel efficiency improvement.  While I've used locomotives and fuel as my primary example, capacity additions have a similar effect on recruit productivity, more cars per crew, asset turns, keeping trains moving with greater train capacity, and also helps our customers with improved train and car performance. On Slide 10, we are complementing our investment in physical capacity with a comprehensive technology strategy that makes our crews more efficient and our assets more productive. Virtually all of our routines signal and track maintenance is now scheduled via the mobile track authority app.  A process that used to be measured in minutes can now be accomplished in seconds. It is inherently more efficient than the radio process of the past and most importantly, safer because it reduces transcription errors. And the words of our Chief Engineer, the app has been a game changer for the productivity of his forces. We're doing the same with our mobile train reporting app, which enables our train crews to quickly report completed work and to receive updated customer work requests while en route. This takes a lot of hands out of the process including significant re-typing and delay and enables our crews to be more productive.  We're still early in the deployment of this application with rollout to the local trains that do the preponderance of pickups and set offs just beginning. The use cases for this technology in the field are numerous and driving adoption and innovation around this platform is a focal point that will allow us to capture additional benefit. The common use thread in these apps is that better information allows people to plan. Our track supervisors can better plan their schedule, knowing the availability of track time, and our customers can better plan their plain operations, in product pipeline with up-to-date shipment information. Now, I will turn it over to Alan. Alan Shaw : Thank you, Cindy, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, we continued to execute on our growth plan, yielding double-digit revenue gains in each of our three markets, further demonstrating our ability to deliver value before our customers and shareholders. Beginning on Slide 12, I will highlight our results for the third quarter. We achieved total revenue of $2.9 billion representing a 14% increase from the same period last year despite flat volumes.  Our revenue performance this quarter was driven by significant gains in revenue per unit and revenue per unit less fuel, both reaching record levels with double-digit year-over-year growth. This reflects the success of our ongoing efforts the yield up and improve revenue quality, a strategy that enhances our long-term potential for revenue and margin growth as conditions improve. Revenue in our merchandise segment improved 10% year-over-year while volume increased 5%. Growth was led by our Chemicals franchise that benefited from recovering energy demand that drove higher shipments of crude oil and natural gas liquids. Also contributing to merchandise growth was sustained strength of steel markets due to record high commodity prices and growth in manufacturing activity. Steel shipments were up an impressive 34% from the same period a year ago. Partially offsetting these gains were declines in shipments of finished vehicles and vehicle parts due to the ongoing semi-conductor shortage. This limited automotive production activity and further depleted finished vehicle inventories to new lows. Both revenue per unit and revenue per unit less fuel improved year-over-year due to price increases. Our intermodal franchise experienced several headwinds related to supply chain disruptions that negatively impacted volume and our domestic and international business lines. In both segments, unprecedented demand from inventory restocking and consumer spending outpaced available capacity in the supply chain ecosystem. The combination of drayage shortages, warehouse productivity, equipment availability, labor force participation, and rail network fluidity, pressured intermodal volume throughout the quarter, resulting in a 4% year-over-year decline.  Overcoming these headwinds, we delivered revenue growth of 16% in the third quarter due to higher revenue from storage services, increased fuel surcharge revenue, and price strength. Coal revenue increased 32% in the third quarter as both domestic and global economies continued to recover from the pandemic and drive demand for electric power. Export coal shipments increased significantly as strong demand and record high seaborne prices, increased opportunities for U.S. producers. Utility volumes declined in the third quarter as coal supply was limited as some crossover tons moved into the higher-rated export market.  The mix shift from utility to export, coupled with price gains, led to a 20% increase in revenue per unit, less fuel for coal in the third quarter. A new record for the franchise. Moving to our Outlook on Slide 13, we expect the third quarter environment to continue through the end of the year. Strong consumer demand will continue while pressures from material shortages and labor issues remain, challenging global supply chains. Inventory levels remain at historic lows despite the continued push to replenish stock, providing a boost to transportation demand.  We remain confident in our ability to leverage our strengths in these market conditions and deliver robust revenue growth for the full year. We expect merchandise business will continue to benefit from recovering economic activity as conditions that limited business and recreational activities in the fourth quarter of last year have been much less impactful in the fourth quarter of 2021. We anticipate our markets for crude oil, natural gas liquids, and waste to experience higher volume as a result.  Ongoing demand for steel will also be a growth driver with forecast for industrial production up more than 5% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, and steel prices currently above 1900 bucks a ton. A projected 4% year-over-year, fourth-quarter decline in U.S. light vehicle production will remain a headwind as the industry remains challenged by the chip shortage. Within intermodal, we continue to see strong demand from consumer spending and tightness in the truck sector. These favorable conditions are offset by constraints from supply chain congestion and equipment availability.  We are working closely with our customers and our channel partners to mitigate these challenges. However, we do not see meaningful improvement in these headwinds before the end of the year. Coal demand is expected to remain strong with extremely favorable market conditions. Although coal supply will be the governor on year-over-year growth, natural gas prices continue to climb and declining inventory levels leading into the winter months are the current focus of utility customers. Seaborne prices are a decade long highs in the export market, creating demand beyond capacity and supply abilities.  Overall, we're optimistic about the opportunities in the fourth quarter and confident in our ability to execute our plan, to generate value, and grow our business. Turning to Slide 14, there are several factors impacting the supply chain in which we participate. This includes external factor, such as the chip shortage and intensifying congestion in the intermodal supply chain. Coal supply availability continues to be a constraint to meet the higher demand in every market as both thermal and net production remained tight. NSC is taking the action to mitigate some of these factors and effectively position us for revenue growth. As Drayage challenges affected international intermodal, we provided an alternative storage solution to our customers. We're working diligently to add chassis capacity to support demand and alleviate shortages across the supply chain. Last quarter, we outlined our plan to repair a portion of our chassis fleet that was impacted by a manufacturing defect. I appreciate the quick action and effort from our team and I'm pleased to report that this issue is effectively behind us. As we have repaired and returned approximately 95% of the recall chassis back to service. We're also in the process of taking delivery of lease chassis to augment our fleet. We've added terminal capacity to support growth driven by e-commerce and a recovering economy, as well as reduced terminal congestion and improved network fluidity. We remain focused on growth opportunities across our network. We are continuously innovating to compete in $800 billion plus truck and logistics market as shown by our thoroughbred freight transfer or TFT service launched earlier this year. TFT is one of our initiatives to drive growth by targeting opportunities for highway conversions to rail. This service combines the efficiency of our intermodal trains, the capacity of our boxcar assets, and the last mile flexibility of trucks to provide an innovative door-to-door service. We're also leveraging our sustainability advantage to propel long-term growth. The choice of transportation mode is one of the most powerful levers any shipper has to reduce the size of its carbon footprint, and we're working closely with our customers to deliver additional value through sustainability. We have proven our ability to deliver results despite challenging market conditions by providing innovative solutions that are customers value and position us for future market demands. I will now turn it over to Mark, who will cover our financial results. Mark George : Thanks. On Slide 16, as Elon just detailed, revenues were up 14% on flat volumes. With operating expenses up 10% we delivered strong incremental margins leading to 230 basis points of operating ratio improvement, driving us to a Q3 record of 60.2% The improvement LN detailed and RPU, coupled with strong productivity led to record Q3 operating income with growth of 21% or nearly $200 million. And our free cash flow is also at record levels, a 33% increase during these 9 months compared to last year. Moving to slide 17, let's drill down into the change and operating expenses.  While operating expenses grew a 149 million or 10%, it's up only 4% or 67 million apart from fuel cost increases. The fuel cost increase of 82 million is driven mainly by price, but the 5% increase in GTMs also drove more consumption. You'll see purchase services up 35 million with a majority of the year-over-year increase in 3 areas. We have an increase in technology spend, which is consistent with our technology strategy, and you've heard a couple project examples in Cindy's remarks. There are also headwinds from Conrail operating expenses, and there are increases in intermodal costs.  More specifically, we had trucking costs associated with shuttling longer dwell containers to satellite parking lots in order to reduce congestion at our terminals and keep the freight moving. Lift expenses were actually up in the quarter despite fewer lifts and that is primarily because of inflation we absorbed on lift rates associated with contractor labor availability. This is an area we do expect to see continued inflationary pressure going forward. And we also absorbed costs in the quarter related to our chassis repairs. Moving on to compensation and benefits, it is up 5% which you'll note the $40 million in savings from 7% lower headcount that more than offsets increase in pay rates and overtime.  Meanwhile, incentive compensation comparisons in the quarter are a headwind of $43 million. Similar to what we reported in the second quarter, reflecting our strong 2021 financial outlook compared to lower accrual rates last year. Materials, claims, and other expenses were all down year-over-year. Turning now to slide 18, and looking at the rest of the P&L below operating income, you'll see that other income of 14 million is 25 million unfavorable year-over-year. And that is due almost entirely to lower net returns from Company-owned life insurance.  Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 23.6%, close to our federal and state statutory rates. But unlike Q3 last year where the rate was 21.9%, and benefited from tax advantages related to both Coly investment gains, and higher stock-based compensation. Net income increased by 17% while earnings per share grew by 22%, supported by 3.6 million shares, we repurchased in the quarter. Wrapping up with our free cash flow on slide 19. As I have mentioned, free cash flow is a record through nine months of 2021 at $2.3 billion buoyed by very strong operating cash generation and that translates into a 102% free cash flow conversion.  While property additions are trending a bit lower than run rate for our $1.6 billion guidance number, capital spend is never linear and we expect fourth quarter property additions will get us close to the 1.6 billion. Shareholder distributions through 9 months exceeds 3.2 billion, an increase of over 1.5 billion versus prior year, thanks to our higher dividend and a meaningful increase in our share repurchase activity. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Jim. Jim Squires : Thank you, Mark. We first demonstrated our commitment to sustainability with our visionary appointment of a Chief Sustainability Officer back in 2007, the first in the industry. And our efforts to support a low carbon supply chain have greatly accelerated since then. Building upon the momentum earlier this year with the approval of our science-based targets for greenhouse gas emissions reduction and our launch of 500 million in green bonds in the second quarter, we are excited to report another set of milestones on our sustainability journey.  In August, we released our 2021 ESG report, our 14th annual report on corporate responsibility, highlighting the transformational role sustainability is having on our business as we further integrate sustainable practices into daily operations. We celebrated our 500th modernized locomotive unit in partnership with Wabtec in August and announced our collaboration with Progress Rail in September on a first of its kind, Tier four locomotive prototype for yard and terminal operations. And just earlier this month, we announced our decision to purchase 100% renewable energy to power Company operations in Altoona and Reading, Pennsylvania. Our commercial and sustainability teams work hand-in-hand to provide demonstrable low-carbon solutions to a wide variety of current and prospective customers, providing a compelling value proposition as we convert more freight from truck to rail, simultaneously benefiting our customers, our communities, and our shareholders. Before we open the call to Q&A, I will take a moment to provide an update to our outlook based on the current economic environments.  As shared previously, we expect to achieve an operating ratio improvement above 400 basis points for the full year versus our adjusted 2020 results. And there's likely upside to the 12% year-over-year revenue growth as strength in our consumer oriented in manufacturing markets drive the majority of the growth. Newer-term upside in coal markets provides a boost for the balance of the year as well, though coal remains challenged in the long term. We're delivering on our financial commitments and remain focused on creating long-term sustainable value for our customers and shareholders. So, with that, we'll open the call to your questions. Operator. Operator : Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. If you'd like to ask a question, [Operator Instructions], a confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. [Operator Instructions]. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. Due to the number of analysts joining us on the call today, we will be limiting everyone to one question to accommodate as many participants as possible. Our first question comes from the line off Jason Seidl with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Jason Seidl : Thank you, Operator, and good morning everybody. I wanted to talk a little bit about the pricing side, several of your peers have mentioned rising cost if you will, and the need to take pricing up another notch. I wanted to get your opinion on that and what Norfolk Southern's plans are for 2022. Jim Squires : Thanks, Jason. Alan? Alan Shaw : Good morning, Jason. As you know, Jason, we price to the market. And right now, the market opportunities for our ability to price are pretty strong, and you've seen that with respect to our yields. You saw us in that [Indiscernible] of our top-line, earlier this year we're very confident in our ability to deliver 9% revenue growth as the demand environment and pricing environment strengthen, we bumped that up to at least 12%. Our primary competitor is truck and you saw that spot rates in the truck market were up 21% year-over-year in the third quarter.  As we have an opportunity to revisit our contracts and the relative value of our product, we're going to price the market as we've always done, which is why we've delivered RPU ex-fuel increases in intermodal for 19 consecutive quarters and in merchandise 25 of the last 26. As commodity prices go up, Jason, it also means more demand for that product as well, so we feel good about the demand and the pricing environment. Jason Seidl : So, Alan, maybe can you remind us the percentage of your business that rolls over in 4Q and 1Q? Alan Shaw : It's a majority of the business rolls over in those two quarters, Jason. And as you know, about 50% of it rolls over every year. It's a good environment for us to revisit our price plan. Jason Seidl : It seems to be, well, listen, appreciate the time, as always nice quarter. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Jordan Alger with Goldman Sachs, please proceed with your question. Jordan Alger : Yeah, hi. You talked a little bit about need to hire crews and the tough environment. One question of course is where [Indiscernible] headcount go from here, but maybe the right question is, in an optimal environment, how much headcount do you think you need? Are you okay where you're at or would you like a 1,000 more people, 500 more people? Thanks. Cindy Sanborn : Good morning, Jordan. Thanks for the question. I think broadly, let me just put a broad perspective on it. We're really managing through a very disrupted labor market and it's been a challenge from the beginning of this year, but we've been able to really continue to find productivity improvements up to this point that the team I think has done a great job of and really, you're seeing it flowing through our financial results.  So, when I think about where headcount should be, it's really a function of volume that we have on the network as well as our productivity initiatives of which we have quite a few with longer trains and other opportunities for productivity. So, I think from where we are right now, we'd like to see headcount up maybe a little bit to take out some of the lumpiness of what we're seeing. But longer-term, we're going to be focusing on using technology and other things, focusing on continuing to bring that down. But at this point with where we are, we'd like to see it come up. Jordan Alger : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Tom Wadewitz : Good morning. Wanted to get your thoughts on capacity expansion, I guess we could talk about intermodal or if you want to talk about broader network, and how that would translate to your view on volume growth in 2022. It seems to me that there's certainly areas where if you had more capacity or the system had more capacity, you'd have stronger volume and intermodal is obvious on that, but how you think about capacity additions in the network capacity? And is it reasonable to expect volume growth in 2022, supported by more capacity? Jim Squires : Cindy, why don't you take the network side of that, the line of road side of the capacity question, then Alan talks about terminal capacity -- intermodal terminal capacity a little bit. Cindy Sanborn : Sure. So, from a line of road perspective, as you know, Tom, we have had a discussion on these calls around siding extensions. We've gotten our first siding extension in service on the third quarter I mentioned that in my prepared remarks and we have about four, five more that are under your way and then studying some others to make sure we have good capability in our single-track locations, predominantly in the southern part of our network to be able to drive longer trains, and improve the capacity overall the network by taking total number of trains down because we can run longer trains. The technology of distributed power has been an enabler for that. And also, as you know, we're doing DC to AC conversions that increased the fleet size of the capability of our fleet to do more of that. So, we really see some good opportunities to continue to allow for great throughput on our network. Alan Shaw : Tom, with respect to the intermodal terminals, we absolutely need to improve the throughput through the terminals. There's some self-help there that's running trains on time, that's making sure that we've got the right amount of labor in the terminals with our terminal contractors. It's the chassis issue. Now that was a headwind for us in the third quarter with the safety recall, we've addressed that. However, we're still short chassis. So, we're taking delivery of 1,100 lease chassis in the fourth quarter of this year. Our customers are short chassis too and so our -- so as the international community as well. And that's really driven by the dislocation and the Drayage and in the warehousing community. If you look at a record, there's a record number of job openings and warehousing and trucking for each of the last 3months. And so that has put a lot of pressure on throughput through the intermodal terminals. We're working on things we can fix ourselves, as I talked about our own mitigation efforts, whether that's reopening a couple of terminals leasing chassis offering dual mission incentives to make the Drayage network more productive, and we're also working with our customers to see how we can help mitigate some of their own issues. Tom Wadewitz : So, I guess to bring that to point though, are you optimistic about intermodal volume growth given what you see on the capacity side, in '22? Alan Shaw : Yes, because we've taken some very concrete steps to address what is under our control and we're hopeful that at some point the Drayage community gets a little healthier and the warehousing community gets healthier as well. Tom Wadewitz : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI, please proceed with your question. Jon Chappell : Thank you. Good morning. Alan, sticking with you, you mentioned improving revenue quality, which I know has been a big focus for you guys over the years and capacity is clearly at a premium, not just in the rails, but in every part of the transport supply chain right now. Are you being increasingly more selective in the freight that you're willing to move right now, and attempt to maximize your capacity in the mix and margin associated with that? And if so, how does that play into your long-term volume outlook sacrificing yield potentially for volume? Alan Shaw : And John, part of yield up is -- it really is the heart of it is allocating resources to the market signals that we get which would indicate where the best home for those resources is. So that involves making sure that we're on-boarding the right type of business onto our network to make sure that we're not adding complexity. and may -- it's involves making sure that we are being compensated for the value of the product that we're delivering. And as you noted, our primary competitor is extremely stressed and truck just does not have the overflow capacity that rail does add into that environment more interest from our customer base on sustainability.  I was talking to a customer the other day about it. Effectively cut me off mid-sentence and said, yes, we all know that rail is much more sustainable than truck and we're doing everything we can to shift more towards rail. So, I think there is a prolonged opportunity to make sure that we continue to post improvements in our yields, I will tell you that one area in which I'm a little concerned is within the coal network with export prices is at record highs. I think it'd be irresponsible for us to feel like they're going to continue to rise into next year, so that might be an area in which you see a decline in yields. Jon Chappell : That makes sense. Thanks, Alan. Alan Shaw : You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Ravi Shanker : Thanks. Good morning everyone. I apologize you missed this, but can you unpack the yield growth you saw on the quarter in terms of core price versus as fuel charges versus next? Alan Shaw : Ravi, certainly the storage solution that we provided in the international community was a driver of RPU growth as was fuel surcharge. We also saw much better pricing environment in the third quarter than in the second which is of no surprise and we've got a lot of momentum with respect to the price. Ravi Shanker : Okay. Maybe as a follow-up on just switching gears a little bit. How do you see the regulatory environment next year, particularly around price? And maybe as related question, can you and all the other rails have been cutting headcount of airbeds over the last several years, what would you say to shippers and other folks in the industry who will say that you cut too deep? And now that you're like you and everybody else are struggling to hire again that you maybe shouldn't have been this iteration to begin with. Obviously, hindsight 2020, who knew how the recovery will work out and such, but just again, trying to figure out from a regulatory perspective. Thanks. Mark George : Well, let me take the second part of that first, and the first part second. We've been hiring aggressively since the beginning of the year and we've ramped that program up throughout the year. So, we're putting a lot of people into the pipeline, through the pipeline, and into the field even as we speak and we'll continue to do so. Recognizing that at least in some locations we are short of people and we need more help.  In terms of regulatory environments, I think it's worth emphasizing that there is a good deal of overlap between what we do and what the administration and Congress are seeking. That overlap is in the area of sustainability. It's widely recognized in Washington today, on both sides of the aisle, that rails are the sustainable ground transportation. And so, we see eye to eye with the administration on that. We're all about economic development and creating good jobs for people and helping the American economy growth.  That lines up very well with what the Administration and Congress are trying to do as well. Now we don't see eye-to-eye on everything where we disagree with policymakers. We maintain a very active dialogue and we make sure that our point-of-view, that our needs that our importance to the American economy are widely understood. Ravi Shanker : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Brandon Oglenski : Hey, good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking my question. Jim, I guess following up from that, given that you guys are hiring, I guess that speaks to a pretty positive economic outlook in 2022, if I'm hearing that correctly. And I guess as you guys talk about improving to industry level of profitability, is that still a lot of leverage on the labor line looking forward? Is it fuel efficiency? I guess where do you guys see the biggest opportunities there? Thank you. Jim Squires : Sure. Well, let me say first, we're proud of the progress our employees have achieved so far this year. We still have a quarter ago, but we're definitely on pace to hit our goals. So, a 60 OR run rate for the full year. Now, the work isn't done. We recognize that we have more room to run and we're very excited about the margin opportunities, the topline growth we see ahead. We will continue to drive the OR lower over time and continue to narrow the gap. We'll do that with the combination of revenue growth and continuing emphasis on productivity and sustainability throughout our Company. That includes fixed costs, that includes employee productivity, that includes fuel efficiency, and so on and so forth. Cindy, anything to add? Cindy Sanborn : And I would add, Brandon, I put in my prepared remarks, technology is really very helpful to us, whether it's mobile applications that allow employees to be in the field as opposed to managing the input of information through a traditional keyboard and computer, whether it's predictive analytics, or whether it's pure automation. So, there's plenty of opportunity out there in addition to train length and some of the other items that I've already talked about so far. Brandon Oglenski : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi, please proceed with your question. Chris Wetherbee : Thanks. Good morning. Maybe a question about service on the broad supply chain dynamics. So, Cindy you talked about some of the efforts that you guys are undertaking to improve service and bounce back a little bit here, obviously the quarter you saw some pretty decent metrics as well, but maybe mixed with what Alan talking about in terms of the supply chain, I guess. When do we see Norfolk service improve in a meaningful way, which may be a precursor to a broader improvement in the supply chain. I think Alan, you talked about maybe nothing before the end of the year, but maybe what are some early indicators that the process is turning and maybe some of this congestion can clear, we can improve fluidity a little bit more, which could be like I said, the precursor to a broader congestion alleviation. Cindy Sanborn : So as far as where we are with service levels that are public that I talked through, I really see the big linchpin obviously being people talk about this is a fairly disrupted labor environment. We are hiring people as Jim has noted, but bringing on people to is long lead time. We have streamlined our process of hiring and also our training process, taking advantage of technology to do so. Obviously, we're not going to compromise safety and anything that we do with that regard.  And we've doubled our class size since July, and other type issues, but that is going to be what is helps us to see our service levels improve. But this is a national issue and it's, as you know, it's at the heart of the supply chain overall and it's been building for a while and it'll for months and will probably take a few months for us to clear through it. Alan, I don't know if you have anything you want to add. Alan Shaw : Yeah. With respect to the entire supply chain ecosystem, Chris, warehouses are full, that's what we're hearing from the VCOs and I think you need about 25% more warehouse capacity than what's available right now. There's just not enough labor and frankly, a lot of the e-commerce giants are just now in the process of starting to hire for the holiday season. So, I think that's going to further stress things going forward. We've actually seen in Chicago a degradation in street dwell on international chassis over the last couple weeks which would indicate more stress in that first-mile, last-mile component of the ecosystem. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. Now, let's talk to your customers its maybe next year is what they are talking, any indication for them in terms of timing and what they feel a little bit better? Alan Shaw : That we're not because it's reliant on so many different components. And frankly, they are asking about the same questions that Cindy addressed too. We've got to improve our piece of it. We're having those discussions with them, but they also recognize there are a lot of things out there that are well outside of our control that -- I just don't have a timeline as to when the Drayage community and the warehouse community start to get healthy. On the top 20 Drayage markets, most of them are in our footprint. That's a great thing that those have stronger inter-modal franchises. It also indicates that when the Drayage community is stressed, it puts stress on our network. Chris Wetherbee : Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Brian Ossenbeck : Thank you. Good morning. Just wanted to maybe follow up on that last question with you, Alan. Just thinking about the pace of truckload conversion industrial development project wins. Clear, there's a ton of demand but challenging across the board as you've been talking about. Can you go into the TFT product you mentioned a little bit more? Is that something you feel like you need to expand to get more of a door-to-door service, a longer-term, and to make some of these wins really sticky? And do you think you have to do any more investment there in terms of maybe looking at some more non-rail assets? Alan Shaw : Hey, Brian, yes, TFT for us is a pilot program. We're in our early stages, but it seems to be working pretty well. We're testing it with a number of customers who have been displaced out of the LTL market. It uses a lot of the principles of PSR. i.e., you're putting boxcars on intermodal trains and we're using a partnership with a Drayage Company to provide first mile, last mile. It's all part of our core competency of innovating to provide solutions that will drive highway to rail conversions in that $800 billion plus on truck and logistics market. The regulatory agency over us took notice of it and it's complementary of our efforts to try and drive truck conversions. So, we're happy with the way it's going so far, we're testing in a number of markets, and its indicative of our overall strategy. Brian Ossenbeck : And is this something you think could scale pretty rapidly in '22 or is this more of a pilot borne sort of out necessity of the current market? Alan Shaw : I think long term, there's going to be opportunity for this because e-commerce isn't going away. And it's an -- e-commerce itself is a boon to us as well because it's highly intermodal intensive, so it's something that we're going to continue to look to add dots on the math in a low-risk manner to drive incremental margins. Brian Ossenbeck : That's helpful. Thanks, Alan. Alan Shaw : Welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott Group : Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Mark, maybe can you give us some thoughts on operating ratio sequentially in fourth quarter and any thoughts on specific cost items in fourth quarter heading into next year? And then Jim, it sounds like we haven't heard anything from the rails, this earnings season with respect to vaccine mandates and just curious your thoughts there and what you guys are doing there. Jim Squires : Okay thanks Scott, I'd tell you what. Why don't I take that one first and then we'll turn it over to Mark for some color around the expense trends? With respect to the vaccine mandate, I want to say first that we sincerely hope we won't lose a single Norfolk Southern employee as a result of that government mandate. That our employees will consider vaccination, those who aren't vaccinated or will seek an accommodation to which they're entitled under the law. And we didn't -- this was not our idea.  This was not our initiative. This is a mandate. We reviewed it, we studied it, we went over it with a fine-tooth comb. We determined that we are federal contractors subject to the executive order because of the business we do for the Department of Defense, principally. So, we're now in the process of implementing it. It's a tough, tough decision that's being imposed on some of our employees as result. And we do regret that, however, we will follow the law it clearly applies to us and we must comply. The next -- and so what's next?  Well, we get the information out there, we owe it to our employees to be clear about where we stand and what happens next, leading up to the December 8th deadline, for compliance. And people have time to go out because we announced we would comply with a lot and we've given people time to get vaccinated or to seek a combinations. We're keeping a very close eye on the impact. As I said, I hope we don't lose a single person. We will probably lose some employees as a result of this, and we will work very hard to retain them first, but second, if not back fill the positions with all of the measures that Cindy went through. So, Mark talks a little bit about the expense trends. Mark George : Okay. Scott well, first I think your question was on sequential OR as we look to Q4. Q3, we did see pretty much stable OR from Q2 when you back out the land size, the outside land sale that we had last quarter. Now, I think we were about 10 basis points better in Q3 and then we expect to see basically more of the same here in Q4. Some of that will depend on the volume outlook as we navigate through Q4. I do expect that the expense side of the equation should also be roughly consistent with what we've experienced here this quarter. So, it just feels like more of the same as we close out the year and that will stay on this run rate like we talked about earlier in the year. Scott Group : That's helpful. Jim, if I can just follow-up on the vaccine for one second, it feels like everyone in the supply chain thinks that this is a bad idea or at least a big risk to further supply chain disruptions. Do you -- is there any sense that maybe some of this could get pushed out or get rid of all together? Just everyone seems to think it's a big risk. Jim Squires : Well, our strategy there is to communicate clearly with policymakers about the risks associated with this mandate. And we are doing that actively making sure that those who are in a position to shift policy understand what the consequences could be. So, whether we agree with the policy or not, we are implementing it as we are required to do. Meanwhile though, we're being very vocal about the possible consequences to the supply chain into the economy. Scott Group : Okay. Thank you, guys, appreciate it. Jim Squires : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets, please proceed with your question. Walter Spracklin : Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to go back to the regulatory question, just wondering if there's a bit of a silver lining here with supply chain issues and the very delicate capacity environment that this is proven our entire transportation network has. And my question, I guess for Jim here is things like reciprocal switching which eat up capacity with a different objective in mind but the consequence being that it eats up capacity. You think the White House is aware of this? Do you think the regulator recognizes that messing around with regulations that have one intended consequence could have a very detrimental one when it comes to capacity? And some of the indications that we've seen with where the capacity is, puts that at significant rise. Do you think that's lost on regulators or is it something that they become acutely aware of now and we'll rethink when potentially designing new forms of regulation for the railroad industry? Jim Squires : I think you summarized it pretty well and there is growing sensitivity and awareness on the part of regulators and policymakers regarding the state of affairs in the supply chain and the risks associated with policy changes at this stage. So, my message is at the very least, consider gathering additional facts and evidence, the supply chain is clearly in flux right now. It's in the process of reorganizing itself. And we don't know exactly what the future freight supply chains will look like. So given that the record in the relevant STB proceedings predates all of that, Well, let's at least take a look at the current state of play and understand how freight is moving in today's economy and may move in the future before we make any significant policy changes. Walter Spracklin : And just on that, Jim, as the supply chain reorganizes, do you think that railroads will either play an increasing role outside of their railroad focus? In other words, if despite your best efforts to -- unsuccessful efforts to manage your own house, if there's problems outside of your control, outside of your rail network that you could address if you had ownership of that, those pieces further up or down the supply chain, would that be something Norfolk Southern would consider? Would you be willing to or interested in going outside of your rail focus if it means addressing some of these items that are outside of your control? Jim Squires : I would put it this way, we see so many opportunities within our core business today. So many opportunities for organic growth by converting freight from road-to-rail within our existing franchise that we don't see a need to pursue businesses or approaches outside our core. And our -- because there are always risks associated with that M&A risks. And we've tried that before if you look back in history, as a Company, we have owned trucking companies, and it didn't end well. So, our approach will be to stick to what we know best and what we can execute best in light of all of the growth opportunities we have there. Walter Spracklin : Great. I appreciate the time. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank, please proceed with your question. Amit Mehrotra : Thanks, Operator. Hi, everybody. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Alan, I just wanted to follow up on the intermodal growth questions. Obviously, we fully appreciate the challenges around Drayage capacity and labor and warehouses, but just looking from the outside in, it's pretty clear that there have been some market share shifts in intermodal with your direct competitor, I mean, the chassis issue explains some of it but -- and we've seen a little bit of an uptake in weekly intermodal carloads but there seems to be some market share shift.  I don't know if you think that's a fair characterization and if it is what the root cause is and you can address it but if you can just talk about that and then my second question, Mark, you use to provide this great slide that talked about fixed versus variable cost structures that spoke to the underlying operating leverage in the business. The cost structure is very different today, given all the good work that Cindy and her team have done, and the whole team have done. So, I was wondering if you can baseline where you think incremental for the business are given maybe a more volume variable cost structure than maybe you had a couple of years ago? Thanks a lot. Alan Shaw : Amit, I'll cover the first part. In third quarter there were some international customer specific actions with respect to inland positioning of containers that impacted our volumes. That's starting to unwind itself and so we should see a lift there. Although ultimately international volumes are going to be limited by the Drayage community in the warehouse community. Look, we've got the most powerful inter-modal franchise in the east. It is a key component of our plan going forward to lever that in the growth. We prove we can do it over time. 2017, our revenue was up 11%, 2018, it was up 18%. 2019, it was only down 2% of freight recession and it pivoted back to growth in the fourth quarter of 2019. This year, our revenue in intermodal was up 21%. And compared to 2016, our revenue and intermodal was up 43%. So, we know it's a growth driver for us. We've done a lot to improve the productivity there, just in the third quarter, our train weight and intermodal was up 4%, and yet our train length was down 3%. So, we've got some things that we need to do to provide our customers with a better service product, they deserve that. We also have some things that we need to do at the interface with our customers to collaborate with them on making the whole supply chain efficient. Jim Squires : And Amit I'll talk to you about the incremental. We had 57% incremental this quarter. I just want to point out that would be about 70% if not for the headwind that higher fuel costs and surcharge gave to us this quarter. So, I think 70% core incremental margins are pretty good, think we've done a very good job absorbing a lot of the volume growth that we've seeing this year without adding on the resource side. In some areas like you mentioned, the incremental costs have risen in some lines and other lines they've held flat.  We have changed our cost structure quite a bit in the past year and so some of those drivers have varied, but I do think net-net. If we can continue, our goal here is to continue holding costs while we absorb incremental volume, and certainly the drop-through from other revenue contributors. We're going to be in a good place to help drive us down on OR side. Amit Mehrotra : Got it. Okay, very helpful. Thank you very much. Jim Squires : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Ken Hoexter : Thanks. Good morning, Jim and team. Great job on the improvement. Just a follow on the -- you gave before the fourth quarter outlook on operating ratio. I want to make it maybe just a little bit bigger. Your initial thoughts on 2022, just given your 400 basis points at least to improvement in the OR, maybe the scale of gains. And I know you're not necessarily going to give a number and you don't typically, but maybe Cindy, can you talk about the additional cost programs that you're looking at? Alan, maybe your thoughts on growth off of this higher base and the sustainability, just maybe some general thoughts to put a picture on to '22 as we close out '21. Mark George : Sure. Okay, Ken, thanks. Let me take the first part of that. As we look ahead to 2022 and beyond, as I said, we're committed to driving the OR lower and we will do that with a combination of emphasis on productivity and efficiency measures at top-line growth and there's a lot of opportunity for us there. We will get more specific with our 2022 guidance in January when we come back to you with our fourth quarter results. In terms of a new set of goals for the longer term, look for an investor day on our part sometime next year, we'll get more specific with regard to dates in the near future, but it's clearly time for us to update our longer-range goals as well. Cindy Sanborn : So that one would to be a broken record, but we do have opportunities for train size and train length with our siding extensions, but also with growth being able to add into existing trains. We see great opportunity there to continue productivity and great drop-through on that revenue. We've got extra board consolidations, we just constricting crews\u2019 segments, those types of activities. Continued improvement in our processes and I can't underemphasize technology. I made some remarks about that earlier, so I will repeat those but the technological advances that will help us be much more efficient in how we go about our business. So, there's a great pipeline and I'm more excited about getting on the railroad. Alan Shaw : Ken with respect to the macro environment, it's unique. it's uniquely strong. You take a look at inventory sales ratios, historic lows, and the consumer has a healthy balance sheet and the retail sales are continuing to increase, and so that inventory replenishment cycle is going to be a boost to transportation demand into -- well into 2022. PMI is at 61.1, which is well into expansionary phase right now.  Demand is really high, the only thing that indicates that -- the only thing holding it back are supply chain challenges, which we need to help solve for our customers. Steel prices are at record highs in a really weak auto environment. So, think about what happens when auto starts a rebound next year and potentially you sprinkle on a little bit of an infrastructure package before the mid-terms, and we expect to have a robust environment for our product, our consumer-facing franchise next year as well. Ken Hoexter : Really helpful. Appreciate the insight. Jim, just can I just get one quick clarification? The impact on KCISCP on the Meridian Speedway, I presume there is no impact to your network and your ability to run in everything. I just wanted -- if you have any quick thought on that. Jim Squires : Let me say this, we will be active participants in that STB proceeding, making sure that our customers interests and our shareholders\u2019 interests are protected throughout that. We expect to continue to utilize the Meridian Speedway as part of our joint venture, and to grow traffic on that line is a great route. The best of the business from LA, Long Beach to the Southeast. So, we think that the transaction you mentioned gives us every opportunity to grow our business over that line. Ken Hoexter : All right. Appreciate the climate around. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens, please proceed with your question. Justin Long : Thanks. Good morning. Mark, I wanted to clarify a statement you made earlier about volumes in the fourth quarter. Were you saying your expectation is for fourth quarter volumes to be relatively flat sequentially? And then on the headcount topic, Cindy, you mentioned that you'd like to see headcount up a little bit. So similar clarification question is the expectation that headcount will be up slightly in the fourth quarter on a sequential basis. And thinking about next year is the view that if hypothetically we see volume growth in the low to mid-single-digits headcount is probably up a little but not up as much as volumes. Mark George : Justin I'll tackle your volume question first. I mean, if you do look at the weekly trends on volumes, you'll see it's going sideways and we expect that trend to carry out for the full quarter. Cindy Sanborn : On headcount, just not -- what I would basically say is that we are still seeing attrition and replenishment as part of our challenge. So, we will probably see headcount come down a little bit more. I would like to see it stabilize and come up because we are replenishing for attrition. So that's what I'm -- my comments earlier. What that meant, are still our long-term opportunities, again, on train size and other process improvements on our terminals and few other things I mentioned are very, very beneficial to us to bring headcount down longer-term. Justin Long : Okay. So, headed into 2022, just hypothetically, if you saw low to mid-single-digit volume growth, do you feel like you could keep headcount relatively flat sequentially, given the productivity opportunity? Cindy Sanborn : I think it would be along those lines, maybe up slightly, but yes, along those lines. Justin Long : Okay. Great, thank you so much. Cindy Sanborn : Not one for one, Justin I guess it's what I'm getting at. Justin Long : Understood. Thanks for the time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Nolan with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Ben Nolan : Thanks. I wanted to circle back a little bit on the coal front and appreciating that next year could be very different than the market is at the moment. But if natural gas prices were to stay high internationally, and there's good demand, I was just curious if you can maybe frame in what your potential to grow is within the coal franchise if the market conditions persist as they are currently. Alan Shaw : Ben, as you know, the market is quite hot and cold, whether it's domestic or export. And really where our volumes are limited right now is on the production side. This has been a severe under-investment, frankly, in anything that generates our BTUs over the last 18 months. The export market, prices are at record highs. China, the early indications are that China will need to import more coal next year than it did this year. It's China's trade tensions with Australia are certainly driving some of the demand on higher prices. But China hasn't shown any indication to unwind that.  And with steel prices so high, China can afford to pay the higher input prices. So, we're watching it very closely. We're continuing to talk to our customers about it. We're hopeful that production improves and we would certainly be a beneficiary of that. Just, you take a look at, in the utility market. Coal burn is up 73 million tons this year, but coal shipments are up 16 million tons. So that kind of tells you what's going on there. Stockpiles, at least in our region are down 55% year-over-year. So there just is not enough production to satisfy the demand with all the geopolitical issues that are going on, and then as the substitute fuels being so -- priced so high right now, as you noted. Ben Nolan : Right. Perfect. I appreciate the color. Thanks. [Indiscernible] Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes in line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question. Bascome Majors : Yeah. Thanks for taking my questions. One point of clarification, can you share the current sense of vaccination rate across the network? Jim Squires : Well, we're gathering that information as we speak, and -- but it's really too soon to tell. We will have a better sense of that in the next month or so and we'll be better positioned to understand what the impact could be, what the attrition as a result of the government mandate might be. So, we're keeping a very close eye on that. Bascome Majors : Thanks for that, Jim and I want to clarify some of the labor situation more broadly. Cindy, could you -- is there a way you could frame how the attrition is picking up in focus on any regions or functions where it's been most acute. In any feedback you're getting is to why people are leaving or where they're going, just to understand the problem you're dealing with. Thank you. Cindy Sanborn : [Indiscernible] in a couple of buckets. One bucket is where we have a very, very tight labor market broadly in the region. And that is affecting those [Indiscernible] employees finding alternative places to work, as well as being very difficult to find new conductor training. And there's a corridor too that it's affecting us more broadly in the Midwest part of our network in that particular scenario. And then there's the scenario where we're able to generate trainees and bring them in, they are not quite the numbers that we like. And we have some attrition of those trainees little higher than our historical norm. So that has affected us being able to continue that replenishment type pipeline like we'd like. So, we saw this, starting in the third quarter and we've increased the number of people in our pipeline in those locations where we're able to track folks to are really good Company here by about 240%.  And we've also seen conductor trainees increased by about actual training on the property increased by about 53%. So, that's a different kind of bucket. Now, we are -- we have doubled the class size since probably June, and we expect to also add additional class size in classes by the end of the year to again, attract those in the door and allow for that train process to occur, but there's a lag time here, is what I'm really telling you. And so, we see that persisting into the first part of 2022. Bascome Majors : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. David Vernon : Thanks, Operator. And good morning, team. Mark, I'd like to talk a little bit about intermodal profitability. I want to make sure I understand what the drop-through is on some of the fee revenue? Should we be thinking that's cost-neutral right now? And then if you think about where rates are sort of ex-fuel or ex-surcharges, are you getting enough to cover some of those costs you mentioned around terminal costs and things like that? What I'm really trying to get at here is if we think about contribution from intermodal today, should we be expecting that to be limited by some of the supply chain disruptions and fee issues? And that it will accelerate from here or are we already starting to see some of that improvement sort of in contribution from intermodal in the OR development during -- despite the fact that we have these supply chain disruptions? Mark George : Thanks, David. So, look, I think one way to think about intermodal is we've increased our profitability considerably over the past decade as we've grown volumes and we've been able to demonstrate value to our customers and basically bring our pricing up to where it should be. So, I would say that incremental intermodal business brings to it -- brings with it a creative OR, and we feel like that will continue. It will continue to accrete to the business as we grow our intermodal business. We're providing more and more solutions to our customers, including, the storage service solutions that we've really built up during this period of intense supply chain congestion. So, we are finding new ways to make that business even more profitable. David Vernon : And should we expect that to accelerate as things start to loosen up across the supply chain into '22 and '23? Mark George : Yeah. I think as we get more fluidity in that network and we can take on more volume, because I think the volume is out there. We just need the entire ecosystem to start moving again and loosen up. And I think we have the capacity. We can start moving more and more volume, and there'll be changes, perhaps between -- you might not have quite as much storage revenue, but you'll have more on the volume side. And so overall we feel good about our intermodal prospects for the future. It's a great franchise. We've got the capacity, we've got terminals in the right locations, and we're -- we got great partners on the -- channel partners on the intermodal side. So, we're feeling good about our position. David Vernon : Alright, thanks for the time, guys. Mark George : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen. Our final question this morning comes from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please proceed with your question. Cherilyn Radbourne : Thanks very much and good morning. On International intermodal, could you talk about whether you're seeing volumes start to divert to the East Coast to avoid the congestion on LA, Long Beach currently whether customers are planning to do more of that as the union contract negotiation on the West Coast gets closer. And just if that create different capacity challenges when you get the volume directly on the East Coast versus via interchange with the Western roads. Alan Shaw : Cherilyn, as you noted, customers are seeking optionality. Both short-term and long-term on their supply chain and port diversity is an approach that retailers are employing. We've seen a prolonged shift from West Coast to East Coast over the last 10, 15 years, such that a majority of our international business either originates, or terminates on an East Coast port. The East Coast ports right now are faring much better than LA, Long Beach. I saw something the other day where LA, Long Beach had 96 vessels stacked up outside.  We'll see some more business move over to the East Coast. We've proven the ability to handle that, and handle that well. And one of our -- take a look at our inland port up at Greer, and we pulled 760,000 trucks off the highway since that opened in 2013. And one of our highest volume orders is between Atlantans and Savannah. So, to short-haul moves however, with that added revenue density and incremental volume on existing trains service that Mark and Cindy talked about earlier, it's proven successful for us and for our customers. Cherilyn Radbourne : Thank you. That's all for me. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our Q&A session. I will turn the floor back to Mr. Squires for any final comments. Jim Squires : Thank you, everyone for your questions today, we look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Meghan Achimasi Senior Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. Ms. Achimasi, please go ahead. Meghan Achimasi : Thank you, operator. And good morning, everyone. Please note that during today's call, we will make certain forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties and may differ materially from actual results. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. Our presentation slides are available at nscorp.com in the Investors section along with our reconciliation of non-GAAP measures used today to the comparable GAAP measures.  Along those lines, recall two adjustments during 2020, including a non-cash charge in the first quarter of 2020 related to the sale of 703 locomotives for $385 million and a $99 million impairment charge in the third quarter of 2020 related to an equity method investment. We will speak to full year comparisons excluding those charges from 2020. A full transcript and download will be posted after the call It is now my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's Chairman and CEO, Jim Squires. Jim Squires : Good morning, everyone. And welcome to Norfolk Southern's fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. I\u2019m pleased to be joined by Alan Shaw, President; Cindy Sanborn, Chief Operating Officer, Ed Elkins, Chief Marketing Officer, and Mark George, Chief Financial Officer. Let me start by acknowledging and thanking the entire NS team for the tremendous effort that's gone into the fulfillment of our financial targets established in our 3-year strategic plan. 2021 serves as the pinnacle of the plan and is marked by the achievement of our 60% full year operating ratio and record productivity levels across our operation. Through a multiyear effort, we delivered on our commitments, overcoming significant headwinds associated with first a freight recession and then a global pandemic over the course of our plan. In the past 3 years, we've produced industry-leading total shareholder return. We've grown EPS by 27%, reduced our operating ratio by 530 basis points and return nearly $10 billion back to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. We met and exceeded our goals, albeit with a very different formula than originally anticipated, given the volume headwinds demonstrating our ability to adapt and innovate and our dedication to deliver upon our commitments. I'm so proud to be a part of this team and humbled to serve as its leader.  We're poised to build upon our momentum and write a new record book. The company is in rock solid position. And we have the right team to guide our next chapter of success. With that, I welcome Ed to his new role as Chief Marketing Officer and congratulate Alan on his appointment as President. It's my pleasure now to turn the discussion over to Alan for a detailed look at the fourth quarter and full year results. Alan? Alan Shaw : Thank you, Jim. As Jim noted, 2021 represents the culmination of our multiyear plan. And I'm pleased to share with you the progress we made in the fourth quarter. As you see from our results on Slide 5, revenue growth of 11%, outpaced our expense increase of 8%, producing an 18% improvement in earnings per share and a fourth quarter record operating ratio of 60.4%. For the full year, revenues improved 14%, which more than offset the 6% increase in operating expenses. We delivered the hallmark 60% operating ratio for the full year, an improvement of 430 basis points over the adjusted full year 2020 result, and our sixth consecutive year of improvement. We are excited to share more details of our results. And you'll hear from both Cindy and Ed about work to iterate on the next phase of our thoroughbred operating plan that will serve as the framework for our continued progress on service, productivity and growth. Now first turn to Cindy for a review of our operations. Cindy. Cindy Sanborn : Thank you, Alan and good morning. During the fourth quarter, headwinds from the tight labor market created acute operational challenges across several parts of our network. While working to overcome the workforce planning hurdles, we remain focused on leveraging productivity initiatives to move freight for our customers. These efforts did bear fruit, but our service quality was significantly below where we needed it to be. I'm going to discuss with you today the strategic approach we are taking to change this. Turning to Slide 7, pronounced changes in business mix were evidenced by the unit volume decline 4%, while GTMs were up 1%. Productivity gains were key to handling volumes in the quarter as the transportation workforce contracted by 8%. The reduction in crew starts a 4%, growth in train weight of 10% and growth in train length of 8% were critical elements of this productivity formula as well. There were active locomotive count increased by 5%. As the network slowed, we kept focused on efficiently deploying those locomotives on the larger trains, which helped drive the 3% improvement in fuel efficiency. As I mentioned a few moments ago, you can see the degradation of network fluidity on Slide 8. We regained a modest amount of ground over the holidays. And as we're entering the first quarter, our improvements have been sporadic as COVID related absences have more than doubled from where they were in December. Let me be clear, our top priority is to drive the service improvements our customers expect and need and we will get there. We are working very hard to leverage an increased hiring pipeline as well as productivity initiatives to drive our performance. Next, I'll provide more details on the hiring process on Slide 9. We've made significant progress in ramping up resources to improve the pace of hiring while pursuing productivity. And as shown on the slide, we are pulling 5 key levers to do so including : number one, incorporating additional recruiting and training resources to increase hiring; employees from across the company have volunteered to provide support and our principal training facility and it's all hands on deck. Number two, streamlining the hiring and onboarding process. We trimmed weeks from the process of first identifying a candidate to have them on board. Three, increasing trainee pay and offering incentives such as signing, retention and referral bonuses. Four, lengthening and combining trains. We've made solid progress in this regard. And finally five, we're using a variety of techniques to optimize our existing crews, including realigning crew districts and making crew basis more fungible. Our people are getting creative and rising to the challenge. And resource additions are bearing fruit as we've on boarded over 3 times more conductor trainees in January than any month in 2021. These trainees will promote throughout the second quarter, which is when we expect to start improving train and engine service staffing levels.  We do expect to see some relief and critical crew bases during Q1, as trainees that started in 2021 became promoted. Though, we are still experiencing high levels of attrition in those same areas. On average we expect the number of certified train and engine employees in 2022, to approximate that of 2021 and are expecting GTMs per employee to increase. So when looking at the year as a whole, our plan is to leverage productivity gains to absorb volume growth, while getting the workforce rebalanced to drive improvements in service quality.  Let's unpack the productivity discussion a little more on Slide 10. We've improved average train weight and length 21% and 20% respectively since mid-2019, when TOP21 was launched. This has been a key to our success and will continue to be so going forward. Larger trains, reduced labor intensity, improved locomotive productivity, improved fuel efficiency, and provide our customers with a platform for growth. We have efforts in the pipeline to continue this trend.  First on the infrastructure front. In 2021, we launched work on 9 citing extensions, one of which was quickly completed and in service by the fourth quarter. Most of the others will be completed throughout 2022. Second, our very capital efficient and high performing DC to AC locomotive modernization program is ongoing. As a reminder, this is a dual purpose program to rebuild engines at the end of their life, while converting them to the latest and greatest technology.  In 2021, we improved our fleet composition to nearly 60% AC power and 65% of our road fleet is capable of distributed power. Both of these aid with running larger trains. Lastly, our operating plan and growth initiatives must be well aligned to add capacity to existing trains which brings me to Slide 11.  In 2022, we have already kicked off the next generation of our PSR-based operating plan which we are calling TOP SPG. While you may be familiar with NS\u2019s legacy of Thoroughbred Operating Plans, or TOP the next generation SPG represents a new era of service productivity and growth 3 equally important facets of our new operating plan. We are embarking on this next era because we have significant improvements that need to be made in each of these areas service, productivity and growth to reach our full potential.  We are taking a ground up approach to the development of the plan in order to explore what is possible when we remove historical constraints and take a fresh look at our business. We are leveraging lessons learned from the first 3 years of PSR operations under TOP 21. And using a rich data set to execute in a customer-centric collaborative process. We look forward to keeping you updated as this initiative unfolds throughout the year.  Thank you and I'll now turn it over to Ed. Ed Elkins : Thank you, Cindy. And good morning, everyone. Now beginning on Slide 13, I will highlight our results for the fourth quarter. Total revenue improved 11% year-over-year to $2.9 billion, as strong demand and favorable price conditions more than offset the 4% volume decline in the fourth quarter.  Volume was impacted by the continuation of the extraordinary global supply chain disruptions and slower network velocity. Pricing strength across all markets contributed to the 50% increase in revenue per unit and we reached record revenue per unit less fuel across all of our markets. This demonstrates our ongoing commitment to execute our yield up strategy and drive value for both our customers and our shareholders.  Within merchandize, volume growth in the fourth quarter was led by our Chemicals franchise, as rising economic activity drove demand for chemical products, particularly for crude oil and natural gas liquids. Gains in our Metals business also contributed to growth, with volume in these markets up 6% year-over-year on sustained high demand from the strengthening manufacturing sector.  Partially offsetting merchandize growth was a decline in automotive shipments which were down 9% year-over-year due to slower velocity coupled with strong comps in the fourth quarter of 2020 when the industry was boosted by pent up demand.  Merchandize revenue per unit increased 6% year-over-year, driving total revenue growth of 8% to $1.7 billion for the quarter. Revenue per unit less fuel for this market reached record level in the fourth quarter. We've demonstrated year-over-year growth in this metric for 26 of the last 27 quarters, which further demonstrates our ability to drive sustainable revenue growth.  Our Animal franchise continued to face pressure from supply chain volatility, resulting in a volume decline of 7% year-over-year. Strong consumer demand and elevated imports stressed the supply chains and exceeded drayage capacity and equipment availability. This negatively affected both our domestic and our international markets. But despite these headwinds, we achieved record intermodal revenue in the quarter, up 14% year-over-year, and that was driven by increased fuel revenue storage revenue and price gains. Revenue per unit less fuel grew for the 20th consecutive quarter.  Now, turning to coal. Revenue increased 21% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, which was driven by price gains and higher demand in a tightly supplied market. Coal revenue per unit reached near record levels and increased 16% year-over-year. Our export markets continue to benefit from high seaborne coal prices, which increased the competitiveness of U.S. coals in the global market. Shipments of domestic mat and coke are particularly strong this quarter on higher demand to support steel production.  If you'll turn to Slide 14, full year 2021 revenue grew 14% to $11.1 billion on 5% volume growth. All of our markets posted gains, reflecting strong demand for our product coming out of the pandemic tempered by supply chain pressures experienced throughout the year. Revenue growth was strongest and our merchandize franchise, where all lines of business, but particularly metals and construction benefited from higher demand and favorable price conditions associated with the economic recovery. Intermodal growth was driven by elevated consumer activity and tight truck capacity.  Coal revenue increased on higher seaborne coal prices and growth in steel production activity. We reached record levels of both revenue per unit and revenue per unit less fuel. Both metrics were up year-over-year due to price gains, storage charges, and higher fuel revenue in the case of total revenue per unit. And as markets have evolved, we've leveraged favorable conditions to drive improvement for our bottom line.  Now, let's look ahead to our outlook for 2022 on Slide 15. We're optimistic that our business will continue to grow. Despite the ongoing uncertainty in the economy, we're increasingly confident that supply chain conditions, including rail network velocity will improve as the year progresses. Overall, the demand environment for our service strong. We're committed to working with our customers and channel partners to develop sustainable solutions to maximize our opportunities ahead. We remain focused on our ability to deliver value for our customers and leverage market conditions throughout 2022.  As Cindy explained, both our hiring plan and the development and implementation of TOP SPG will deliver increased fluidity, efficiency and network capacity as the year progresses. And our volume pattern will follow that same sequential improvement trend. This will allow our customers to provide additional value to their customers for their product and build a strong platform for future growth. Market conditions for our merchandize franchise are expected to be favorable, with several customers announcing expansions and the New Year that will create opportunities.  In addition, industrial production is projected to grow 4% in 2022, which will drive demand for most of our markets, particularly for our steel markets. Residential construction spending is forecasted to grow more than 6% this year, following the sharp increase in 2021 supporting continued gains in several of our industrial markets. U.S. light vehicle production is expected to reach 10.3 million units this year, which is approaching pre-pandemic levels of 2019. This recovery will have a positive impact on both our automotive and our metals volumes in 2022.  Demand for our intermodal markets is expected to remain favorable, despite continued headwinds associated with supply chain congestion, impacting our ability to capture new opportunities. These headwinds are expected to ease in the second half of the year, creating more favorable environs for growth. And furthermore a robust consumer economy elongated inventory replenishment cycles and a tight cut market support our growth plan.  Durable goods consumption is expected to improve 3%, and that\u2019s on top of the near record 19% growth in 2021. This also goes well for our intermodal franchise. Our outlook for coal is more guarded as some of the drivers of 2021 growth shows signs of easing in 2022 despite some potential opportunities in the near term.  Seaborne prices remain high. However, they have begun to decline, leading subdued optimism going into the New Year. Expected increases in global production will likely contribute to downward pressure on these seaborne coal prices and lower the demand for export coal. In the utility markets, while there's been strength associated with higher natural gas prices, that upside will be determined by coal supply as production levels remain high. Now before I turn it over to Mark, I would like to highlight our new NSites portal on Slide 16. The pandemic has pushed manufacturers to redesign their supply chains in favor of certainty of supply and locating inventory closer to customers. Our best-in-class industrial development team is at the forefront of these efforts. And they launched an innovative solution to drive value for our customers and support development in the communities that we serve. NSites is a comprehensive search tool for rail, search industrial sites and transload facilities on our network. It allows users to create customized search parameters to quickly identify industrial sites that meet their unique needs. And more importantly, this portal makes it easier to do business with NS and helps our customers make informed long-term investment decisions that will promote economic activity and create jobs. We're excited to provide this product to our customers and help them expand their business on Norfolk Southern.  Overall, we are grateful for our strong customer partnerships. And we look forward to growing our business in 2022 with a continued emphasis on improving our service and driving value for our customers and for our shareholders. Now I'll turn it over to Mark for an update on our financial results. Thank you. Mark George : Thank you. Starting with Slide 18. As Ed noted, revenue was up 11% despite a 4% volume decline. This more than offset an 8% increase in operating expense, which led to 140 basis points of operating ratio improvement to a fourth quarter record of 60.4%. Improvements in RPU, coupled with strong productivity led to a record Q4 operating income with growth of 15% or $145 million. And we set another record for free cash flow, up 30% or $642 million for the full year. Moving to a drill down of operating expenses on Slide 19. While operating expense grew $134 million or 8%. It is up less than 3% or $44 million, apart from fuel cost increases. The $90 million headwind for fuel is driven almost entirely by price. You'll see purchase services and rents of $46 million with the majority of the year-over-year increase driven by the same drivers we talked about on the Q3 call. Higher expenses associated with Conrail, higher technology spend associated with our technology strategy, higher drayage expense associated with more hourly drivers used to alleviate terminal congestion primarily in Chicago, and we continue to see inflationary pressure on lift expenses going forward as it relates to contractor labor availability. Moving on to compensation and benefits. It is up 2%, but you'll note the $33 million in savings from 6% lower headcount. And that more than offset increases in pay rates and overtime. Meanwhile, incentive compensation comparisons in the quarter are a headwind of $24 million. Materials claims and other expenses were all down year-over-year. Turning now to Slide 20. Taking a look at the rest of the P&L below op income, you will see that other income of $21 million is unfavorable year-over-year by $22 million, due in part to lower net returns from company-owned life insurance, but also fewer gains on the dispositions of non-operating properties.  Our effective tax rate in the quarter was in our expected range at 23% and similar to last year. Net income increased 13%, while earnings per share grew by 18%, supported by 3.3 million shares we repurchased in the quarter. Turning to full year highlights on Slide 21. As a reminder, these highlights are compared to adjusted results for 2020, which excludes both the non-cash charge for locomotive rationalization in 1Q and the impairment charge in 3Q. Increased demand across all markets and strong results through yield up resulted in 14% year-over-year revenue improvement.  Expenses increased at less than half that rate, up 6% compared to 2020 as we continued our operational transformation while responding to market changes. We produced record operating income of over $4.4 billion, up 28% or $961 million versus the adjusted 2020 results. And as Jim noted in his opening remarks, we brought our operating ratio down to 60.1%, a record milestone for our company. That is 430 basis points of year-over-year improvement in line with the guidance we provided. Rounding out the results, net income increased 27%, while diluted EPS increased 31%, augmented by our strong share repurchase program, enabled a record free cash flow that we will wrap with on Slide 22. Free cash flow is a record $2.8 billion for 2021, up 30% year-over-year and we reported a strong 93% free cash flow conversion for the year. Property additions were about $100 million lower than our $1.6 billion guidance due to timing issues related to the continued supply chain disruptions. This shortfall in 2021 will carry over into 2022. The sharply higher profitability in the company in '21 allowed for an over $2 billion increase in shareholder distributions for the year. We had 2 dividend increases in 2021 and more than doubled our share repurchase spend. And I'll point out, we just increased our dividend again by $0.15 or 14% in 2022. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Alan. Alan Shaw : Thank you, Mark. Turning to Slide 24. I will wrap up with our 2022 expectations. As you heard from Ed, based on our assessment of economic indicators, we expect markets related to manufacturing and consumer activity to drive growth.  We expect total revenue to deliver upper single-digit growth with merchandise and intermodal both increasing solidly, and coal, resuming its long-term secular decline. We will develop and leverage our new TOP SPG operating plan to accelerate our service recovery and drive additional efficiency into the organization in support of Norfolk Southern\u2019s and our customers' growth. You'll hear a lot more about TOP SPG and our upcoming second quarter Investor Day.  From an operating ratio perspective, we expect the first half of this year to look similar to the back half of 2021, with robust demand and service improvement driving stronger performance in the second half of this year. With this positive momentum in revenue, productivity and efficiency and based on our current expense projections, we expect to achieve greater than 50 basis points of OR improvement in 2022 and we won't stop there. In addition, we expect a dividend payout ratio range of 35% to 40% and capital expenditures in the range of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion. We anticipate using remaining cash flow and financial leverage to repurchase shares. As you've heard from Cindy, Ed and Mark, we are optimistic about service, productivity and growth in the year ahead. And we'll advance productivity initiatives to attract business to Norfolk Southern more profitably than ever. We are committed to further efficiency improvements to create long-term sustained value for our customers and shareholders. Thank you for your attention. We'll now open the line for Q&A. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Brandon Oglenski : Hey. Good morning, everyone. And congrats, Jim on quite a career. Alan, congrats as well moving up here. I guess coming out with this SPG approach. And I guess I heard there was going to be an analyst meeting, but how can you tell us -- how does this differ from the PSR journey that you guys have taken in the last few years? And is this a view that balances growth and cost efficiency and price? Alan Shaw : Good morning, Brandon. It's a continuation of our PSR journey. It's the next generation of it. We implemented TOP21 was really largely focused on our merchandise network. This is going to be focused on all of our service products. It's a comprehensive plan. We are really expecting and challenging ourselves and demanding of ourselves to have an output that delivers longer trains, a balanced network that's going to promote better resource efficiency, which is going to give us the room to grow. It's going to deliver an operating plan that our field can execute on a daily basis. So it's going to improve our service product as well. Brandon Oglenski : Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please procced with your question. Jordan Alliger : Yeah, hi. Good morning. Just sort of curious as you sort of think about yields, revenue per carload as we look forward over the coming year and taking into account price and mix and everything else. I guess, a, how do you see the opportunity around price, particularly with the tightness continuing? And then how do you think about overall yield has certainly moved throughout the year? Thank you. Alan Shaw : Thank you for the question. And it's an inflationary environment out there in the U.S. There's a lot of demand. The U.S. consumer wants to grow. And we intend on delivering value to our customers. So we expect as the year progresses, we're going to see a balance of volume and price that will accelerate as the year moves on. Jordan Alliger : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Chris Wetherbee : Great. Hey, thanks. Good morning. And congrats guys. I guess -- I wanted to maybe dig into that volume and service relationship a little bit deeper. So it sounds like the first half of the year, both service and volume will be a little bit muted, but do you expect to see improvements as it goes forward.  Can you give us a sense of maybe where you're going to see some of those opportunities or some of the improvements in the service side hit first? And what that means or unlocks in terms of opportunity on the volume side. Just want to get a little bit of a better sense of how much volume is sort of included in that upper single-digit revenue growth target for the year? Alan Shaw : So, why don't you take the efficiency piece of that? And talk about what you view as the trajectory for operations and service improvements throughout the year? And then, Ed, maybe you can tackle the revenue implications. Cindy Sanborn : Yeah. Okay, Chris. So from a service standpoint, we are really focused on improving our availability of crew resources to help us with service. We had some accelerated attrition in several core locations of our network that we had to really increase the pipeline for those locations. And that's largely in place.  In fact, of the conductor trainees we have out right now, whether in classroom or in the field, 50% are aimed at those core locations. So as they onboard into the Q2 and the rest of the hiring plan that we have as well, I think we'll start to see our service measures improve and in the back half kind of accelerate. I would also add that TOP SPG is an accelerant as well as we take a look at our service product and take a look at our service plan. As Alan noted, will also be helpful as we think through train length balance for our crews and how we operate the railroad and improve executability, which is also a catalyst. Ed Elkins : And when we look out in 2022, what we see is really with the exception of coal, very healthy commodity markets. There's a lot of demand out there right now as we are able to deliver more payload capacity to our customers, they're going to move it.  And I've already said that we have a strong U.S. consumer, we have a record low inventory sales ratios. We believe that there's going to be continued demand, particularly for durable goods that will bode well for us and for our customers as we're able to deliver more and more value to them as the year progresses. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. Thank you. Appreciated. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Jon Chappell : Thank you. Ed, sticking with you, I've been trying to tie some of these things together. First of all, the high single digit -- just a clarification from the high single-digit revenue, should we think kind of mid-single digit RPU and mid-single-digit volume?  And secondly, to plan to that again, capacities at a premium here, you're clearly ramping up the trainees. It sounds like that's the second quarter, maybe you're not rightsized from an employment standpoint for a few more months. Are you being more selective in the carload you're willing to move right now in an attempt to maximize mix margin and maintain or improve fluidity with the hope that there's more of an inflection in the second half of the year volumes? Ed Elkins : Yeah. We stay very close to our markets and to our customers in those markets. And I think we have a pretty good handle on where the demand is. There's pretty strong demand really from every market that we serve currently. And what we intend to do is, as the year progresses again, we're going to be able to deliver more and more value to those markets and to those customers, whether it's on the bulk side, where we have strong demand or on the consumer product side, which includes both portions of our industrial products business and of course, our intermodal and automotive franchise. Jon Chappell : But are you maybe not taking on as much freight as the demand get pace just in order to get that service to where it needs to be and the network right size from a labor standpoint? Ed Elkins : Well, I think Alan said and Cindy, we're going to get our network running the way we needed to run with SPG -- that's going to be able -- that's going to offer us the opportunity to deliver more value to our customers through service that they need. The productivity that everyone expects and frankly, a long-term platform for growth across all the markets we serve. Jon Chappell : Appreciate it. Thanks guys. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Ravi Shanker : Thanks. Can you just unpack the pricing environment a little bit more kind of what do you expect in terms of core price on a relative basis fine for '22? Kind of how do we think about kind of accessorials kind of impacting the trajectory of RPU, especially in the back half of '22? Thanks. Alan Shaw : When you look at the indices out there, there's clearly a lot of inflation in the U.S. and global economy. There's a lot of demand -- and currently, we are servicing our customers. And we're going to continue to deliver value to them in the long term.  Price is a substantial portion of our plan. It is an intent focus of us going forward as we're able to deliver value to our customers, we want to be able to deliver value for our company and our shareholders. And that's the combination and the recipe that we're focused on. Ravi Shanker : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Brian Ossenbeck : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So maybe for you, Cindy. We've seen a couple of facilities have engaged shutdown. I hear you're trying to hire a lot more on labor just as everybody else across the industry. Is there an equipment shortage issue or maybe a volume balance that you're also trying to work through? And can that be can all that be solved by labor. What else has to go right to get things kind of back on balance? And then maybe a quick follow up for Ed. I hear you on the secular decline for coal in '22, probably a good place to start expectations. But given that coal inventory levels and the utility side are pretty low, could we see some potential restocking this year or maybe just not going to count on that. Thank you. Jim Squires : I think your first question was on intermodal, and I'll start there. We are part of a network that spans not only in the United States but also the global economy. And we are working really hard to make ourselves more efficient on the intermodal side. That includes of course, everything we've done to deliver value to our customers by reconfiguring some of our terminals, adding chassis and working very, very closely with our customers.  As warehouses are able to develop more throughput and more productivity on their side, it will help us not only absorb the volume that wants to move that way, but also help us deliver additional value and improve the velocity of our own network. Same is true on the other end, on the port side as imports are able to become more fluid, we're able to deliver more value in conjunction with them. I think your second question was on coal. Would you mind repeating that part? Brian Ossenbeck : Sure. Just given where utility stockpiles are right now. Obviously, a lot depends how much demand there will be. But could there be a scenario where you see some restocking here on the utility side in the U.S. throughout the rest of the year? Jim Squires : Still utility stockpiles are low. And it's really going to be a combination of the expectation for weather and demand. And frankly, the utility's appetite for inventory replenishment is going to dictate where that goes. I would characterize our position on coal pretty simply as we're trying to be very realistic but also opportunistic when it arises. Brian Ossenbeck : Thank you, guys. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott Group : Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Any thoughts on just some of the extreme volume weakness to start the year and when it gets better? And then, Mark, maybe just some thoughts on some of the individual costs items for 2022, the outlook. I think you've got some tough comps on gains on sales. Maybe just some color on what you're assuming there?  And then lastly, anything in terms of first half or second half margin expectations would be helpful. Jim Squires : I'll start and talk about volumes to start off the year. I think every U.S. railroad was slow out of the block so to speak. Intermodal was particularly, I think that was really a combination of some weather there around the holidays. A holiday that fell on a weekend and probably some COVID impact, either upstream or downstream with warehouses, et cetera, and truckers. But we've seen that demand ramp up since a slow start. On the commodity side of the business, on the bulk side, there's a lot of demand out there. And we're working hard to put every available resource against it. Mark George : Yeah. And Scott, just to get to some of the cost items, typically, you would ask about say comp being [ph] on a per employee basis. And I think I guided this past year to 33 being the area to expect in that back half, and that's where it ended up being coming out for 2021.  And I would say it's probably going to be in that same vicinity here in 2022 is we're going to have a little bit of inflation in wages, but that will be largely offset by tailwinds from lower incentive comp assumptions. So that's probably the best way to think about the comp and ben line. Purchased services had ramped throughout the year. As we told you, we started light in 2021. There were things being pushed out with some of the dynamics that were going on. So I would look at the kind of back half of 2021 as a good run rate to assume for 2022 there. Similarly, I would say where we ended up on materials, if we could avoid growth off of that 2021 base that would be great. But you have to expect there's inflation that we're fighting there. So I would expect a little bit of creep there. And similarly, with rents kind of ramp toward the back half of the year now. And I think the current levels here where we're looking at rents, with network velocity down, it puts pressure on our rents. As the velocity starts to increase, we'll be taking on more volume, which will replace that. So I think pretty flat rents here from Q4 levels. So hopefully, that helps. And I think from a margin perspective. As Alan said, we're probably going to be sideways here to start the year. And we're going to see some sequential improvement from there as volume starts to come onboard the network -- more volume, I should say. Scott Group : Just when you say sideways, can you just clarify maybe I missed what you meant? Jim Squires : No. Sideways from the Q4 levels here of OR. We've got a 60.4% OR we posted. We had something similar there in Q3. I think we're going to go a little bit sideways from those levels until we start taking on more volume. And that's when we'll see that improvement in the operating ratio. Scott Group : Okay, helpful. Thank you, guys. Jim Squires : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Ken Hoexter : Hey, great. Good morning. Jim, congrats on the next phase. I always enjoy the trips, and congrats to Alan and Ed as well.  Just Alan or Ed, just to clarify on those numbers on the volume side there. Volumes are down 14%. Can you parse that by the crew shortage, weather or COVID? Should we still expect to see negative first quarter volumes and then kind of ramping up. I just want to understand your kind of cadence as you look at those volumes, just conflicting with kind of the strong demand comments. And then, Cindy, you mentioned the locomotives and storage -- pulled out of storage. What do you still have left? And is that for the CapEx plan? Or is there still plenty as you pull those from there? Jim Squires : Sure. I'll start with the volume comment. We're watching the volumes very closely and staying very close to our customers as this month has evolved and as this quarter continues. I think we're going to continue to see the relative acceleration of strength that we've seen so far on the intermodal side continue. And we're putting resources up against demand on the bulk side. And that's really where we expect to see TOP SPG help us deliver additional value. Cindy Sanborn : And Ken, on the locomotive question. The engines that we pulled out were really kind of what we would call kind of a dynamic storage environment where we would have them as protect units in case. We had some sort of line outage that would prevent a terminal from operating on time with its outbound trains because the inbound trains were impacted from coming in.  And so we activate units. And then as the backlog came into the terminal, we would then lay down different units. So it was fairly dynamic. And it's a good process for us to have to help us deal with variability on the network that we have from time to time.  So essentially, we activated all of those units. And there are still units in storage that we would need to do a little bit more work on to activate them, but we have not done so. Ken Hoexter : Thanks. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Walter Spracklin : Yeah. Thanks very much, operator. Good morning, everyone. So on the operating ratio improvement of 50 to 100 basis points. Generally, that's something that given the pricing that you're achieving and some block and tackling that you do through the year that, that's a more kind of normalized annual level that we would expect to see of a railroad. Curious if that's your view on it. Are you in the steady state now level of operating ratio with any major improvements or closing the gap kind of done and really just kind of on that standard level? Or do you see upside to that 50 to 100 basis points if some of your initiatives take hold here in 2022 and allow you to achieve something better than that? Alan Shaw : Walter, the operating ratio guidance for this year is reflective of what Mark talked about in terms of just the trajectory of OR, particularly in the first half of the year. We're going to fix our service product. And we're going to get resources in place, and we're going to implement top SPG, which is going to make us less resource intensive. It's going to allow us to grow and provide value to the market and it's going to allow us to provide a very efficient product.  What that does is that gives you kind of a sideways OR in the first half of the year and then some pretty meaningful change in improvement in the second half of the year. Walter Spracklin : Okay. Appreciate the time. Operator : Next question is from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Allison Poliniak : Hi, good morning. Just want to ask about technology. I guess, firstly, how impactful is it to support your SPG initiatives going forward? And I guess, along with that, do we assume technology investment starts to accelerate here, if that's the case or does it just get pivoted to different initiatives under that operational plan. Any color there? Alan Shaw : We've got a fairly robust operations planning model that we will utilize with TOP SPG. And frankly, TOP SPG is clean slate. We're going to put everything out on the table, we're going to redesign our network based on what's best for Norfolk Southern. And the outcomes of that are going to be a balance between service productivity and growth. We've -- Jim started us on our digital transformation. And you've heard us talk about technology improvements and customer facing technology, technology improvements and our efforts to improve our efficiency on line of road and in our intermodal terminals. And we're going to continue that because we fully believe that, that is going to help us better utilize our resources and make us more consistent and more reliable going forward.  A great example is the one that Ed highlighted with NSites. Allison Poliniak : Does that mean that some of those -- I know productivity is important there, but does it -- some of those more customer-facing technology investments, do they start to take more precedence here? Or is it still very well balanced under all of that? Alan Shaw : It continues to be a balance. We will continue to recognize that our relationships with our customers are shifting from B2B to B2C. And Cindy has really helped us focus our technology on operations and productivity improvements as well. Cindy Sanborn : And Allison, I would put the operating side or the operating improvements into 3 big buckets. They'd be mobility, automation and predictive analytics. And we've got a robust set of initiatives in each of those areas. And we've talked about them in the prior earnings calls. So that is a big part of our productivity opportunity. Allison Poliniak : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Tom Wadewitz : Yeah, good morning. So I guess I'll give you -- I've got kind of 2 broader things. The SPG, I'm wondering, we think about PSR having train schedule focus, running longer trains. I know there are a lot of different pieces to it and we have certain metrics that we'll watch to see how you're doing. Should we be considering different metrics for the output of SPG, train length velocity, dwell time. Are those going to be the kind of the right metrics or are there different things that we would look at for kind of outputs of SPG. And then I guess the other topic would just be on labor. Do you think you're at steady state on labor or when you talk about elevated attrition is there still risk that you don't make the progress because you're kind of fighting against that attrition and that remains a challenge? Thank you. Alan Shaw : I'll start first. With respect to the metrics for TOP SPG and what we'll be looking for as what we outlined to improve service, improve productivity and a platform for growth. And then I'll let Cindy talk about the specifics of that. Cindy Sanborn : So Tom, from an SPG perspective, we think it's very PSR-based at its core. It's three main things. It's driving train length, it's driving balance and it's driving executability which then provides service. So as you put those together with SPG, meaning service productivity and growth, all three of those initiatives drive growth in the future as well as service in the present. So we're really excited about it. We had a TOP21 in 2019. A lot has changed since 2019. And so it's really a good timing for us to take on this initiative as well.  Let me go to the labor side. I think we are an attractive company to work for. And we are able to attract people to work for us. And I think as I've described, our hiring plan is very robust as we head into the first quarter. But a lot of that work has been done in 2021. In fact, 6 straight months of increased conductor trainees. And 10 out of the last 12 months, we had an increase in conductor trainees.  So we're going to continue working towards getting onboarding folks that want to be here. We have folks that do come and are excited about working for us as a company, our benefits that we provide and enjoy working on the railroad. So we'll find those folks and bring them on board. It is a challenging environment, but we feel like we'll be able to get the people that we need. And from a measurements perspective, when we look at dwell and train velocity, I mean, those really are the key ingredients to seeing how we're performing. We have a lot of internal measures, both customer-facing and network performance and specific customer measures. So I don't know that SPG changes the measurement outlook. I think what you will see is an improved service product. And you will see that in the measures that we -- that you can see publicly now. Tom Wadewitz : Has the attrition stabilized? Can you give a quick comment on that? That seems like kind of a key variable. Cindy Sanborn : It's about the same. I think it's very hard to predict. We looking at the challenges of last year and did a lot of introspection about what we could have figured out, what could we have done differently. And we have about -- it is right out of 100 hiring locations and saw some outpace out -- unusual attrition at 12 of those hiring locations. And those are still challenging locations to -- from an attrition standpoint, but think we've got our hiring plans aimed to manage through that the best we can. We've got some that we're really seeing an improvement in our pipeline. Some are staying about the same, but we've got our great HR team working on sourcing folks even in a challenging environment because, again, we have a very compelling -- we're a compelling company to work for. Tom Wadewitz : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Justin Long : Jim, Alan and Ed, congrats on all the transitions. I had a two part question. First for Cindy. Just curious when you think service can get back to pre-pandemic levels when you put all the pieces together. And then for Mark, when you look at the implied incremental margins, excluding the big gain on sale from last year of $55 million. It seems to imply incrementals in the mid-50s. I know the network challenges are weighing on that number. But any thoughts on where incremental margins could normalize once we get through some of these network challenges in the second half of this year and into 2023? Cindy Sanborn : Justin, I'll start with service levels. I think we'll be challenged in the first quarter. I think we'll start to see some improvement in the second. And as our new employees come on board. And then I think we'll be back to planned levels of what velocity we have in our plan and what dwell we have in our plan. And that should look close to what you described as pre-pandemic levels. So that's what we're aiming for. And I think TOP SPG helps us with that as well. Mark George : Yeah. And Justin, I would say to the incremental margin question, your math is right. That's the way it calculates. And look we have a little bit less tailwind than we did last year when you think about incrementals.  A little bit on the coal side. Coal pricing and coal volumes won't be as robust. We've got that property gain compare that also impacts the year-over-year look at the incrementals. And as volumes increase, some of the accessorials come down, and that is also an impact as well. And look, the inflationary environment is certainly stronger than it was last year, although we're hoping that incremental pricing will help mitigate that.  So that's -- those are really the drivers here and why you see the step down in incrementals from say last year full year to this year. Although incrementals in the fourth quarter is kind of consistent with what you're seeing in the guidance for next year. Justin Long : Okay. Thank you. Mark George : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Amit Mehrotra : Hey, thanks a lot. Hi, everyone. Mark, I just wanted to follow up on that question, maybe just ask it a little bit of a different way because I know there's a lot of focus on operating ratio on incremental margins which is perfectly valid. But the industry, and I think you guys are also kind of moving to more of an investment for growth phase. And so I'm just trying to think about maybe the right way to think about prospective performance is really about earnings growth potential and total earnings growth potential as opposed to just exclusively on operating ratio expansion.  And I'm wondering to get your thoughts on that. And it looks like kind of low double-digit earnings growth is what you guys are pointing to for this year? And if you think that type of level or trajectory is kind of sustainable over the course of many years. Mark George : Yeah. Amit, the bottom line growth is obviously a function of margin expansion and the top-line growth. So as the runway for margin expansion lessens, you're going to have to rely more on top-line growth. And that's why there is a G in the SPG. We're looking to grow this business, and we're not waiting until we get to margins at the right level to do that. So the incremental this year, for example, that we're guiding to. If we can outperform on the top-line and even get more revenue and more volume onto this railroad that should really help the incremental equation. So every extra point of revenue growth you get, I do believe, you'll have stronger incrementals.  And certainly, as we look out from 2022 and when we're back to where we want to be from a service level perspective, provided the external environment is supportive from an economic growth perspective, we would hope to be able to outperform on the top-line and have that be a primary catalyst for that bottom line growth in conjunction with continued improvement on the OR. Because you are going to have accretive incrementals. It's just I think your incrementals will be larger the larger your top-line growth is. Amit Mehrotra : So just if I understand what you're saying, I guess, the optics around the muted incrementals this year, the answer to your previous question, is really reflective of the first half. But the operating leverage in the business in terms of 60% to 70% incrementals, that's still the right way to think about prospective incrementals in a more growth year environment. Is that correct? Mark George : I mean I'm not going to range bound it for the future. But yeah, I do believe incrementals should be better when we don't have some of the headwinds that we're dealing with this year. Amit Mehrotra : Yeah. Okay. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Mark George : Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ben Nolan with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Ben Nolan : Yeah, thanks. I was a little curious on the coal side. Certainly, from what we've heard from some of your competitors, you have a lot more optimism for this year with respect to exports and just coal volumes in general. Is this something that you're hearing from your clients or just macro view, maybe just a differentiated opinion? I wonder if you could put a little color around that. Ed Elkins : Sure. This is Ed. Thanks for the question. If you look at the futures, they're all pointing in a downward direction for '22 as it progresses and into '23. The indices are already down a little bit from where they were in the Q4. Mix is going to play a part of course.  And on the seaborne side, in particular, for export, I think there's 20 million tons of new capacity that's coming online globally. And while demand right now I think is being held up by some supply issues, will we keep up with that additional production that's coming online. We're very guarded on that. Ben Nolan : Okay. All right. So it is just macro then. I appreciate it. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question. Bascome Majors : Yeah. Thanks for taking my questions. Alan, you've been at the railroad for 27 years. You've been in the marketing officer seat for 7. There's probably not a big customer you hadn't met with multiple times. So I know you're probably not going to have the traditional kind of 100 days to start the CEO role in a couple of months here in May when you take over. But can you give us a little view on really what your near term objectives are, and what constituencies you want to engage with when you do initially take the reins? Alan Shaw : Yeah. The near term objectives are improving service, continuing the phenomenal momentum that we've had with our efficiency. And when you provide a safe and efficient and reliable service product, you can grow. We've got this fantastic franchise that faces the fastest-growing segments of the U.S. economy.  We're positioned really well over the long-term. The folks that I've been spending the most time with right now have been our ops team. And it's the ops leadership and our craft employees out in the field. And I'm really engaging in conversations with them, I'm listening and getting their feedback on how we continue to focus on efficiency improvements and restoring our service levels to where we all want it. Because that's going to be a big boost to our efficiency and our margins as well, as Mark noted. Bascome Majors : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jeff Kaufman with Vertical Research. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Kauffman : Thank you for taking my question. And congratulations, Jim. And congratulations, Alan on the executive changes. Just 2 quick modeling questions. I'll grab it on the same one. So did I understand you're right on the share repurchases going forward are more a function of over cash flow after dividends and free cash and that you're not really looking to lever up to repurchase shares? And then the second part of that, just any guidance on tax rate for 2022. Mark George : Yeah. Jeff, that's exactly right. The share repurchase is a function of leftover cash. So as earnings grow we're also growing our CapEx, but whatever money is left over, being committed to our credit rating. Whatever money is left over, we distribute to shareholders in the form of dividends, which we've increased and share repurchase. So that's that. And then with regard to the tax rate, we typically guide to 23% to 24%. And we're not anticipating any change to the corporate tax rate in 2022. So that maintains -- that guidance is maintained. Jeff Kauffman : That\u2019s my one and half. Thank you Mark George : Okay. Operator : Our next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. David Vernon : Hey, good morning, guys. Jim, I'd love to get your perspective on a couple of regulatory issues. Obviously, there's more discussions around the access to date, open access and hearings coming up in the next couple of quarters here. How worried should investors be about this issue? Can you help kind of frame your perspective on what the proposed changes could mean from a business impact standpoint for Norfolk Southern?  And then if you could also kind of comment a little bit around kind of what the objectives are around the responsive application filed in CPKCS? Like what is the size of the opportunity that you're seeing there from looking for more access over the Meridian and potentially more of the KCS? Thanks. Jim Squires : To tell you what, David, let me take the first part of that regarding the STB proceedings in flight. And then I'll ask Alan to address the CPKC matter. With respect to the STB proceedings, we've made known to the STB that we oppose 7-Eleven forced access. I personally was in front of the vent sitting commissioners late last year and made the case with our team. Based on the potential for operational disruption, supply chains in flux, the outdated nature of the evidence in the record much of it years old. And we think stale.  And so we made our case. And we will continue to do so as these proceedings unfold. Alan, talk a little bit about CPKC. Alan Shaw : Yeah. So the STB provides us a form to protect our customers and our shareholders' interest. We've had a very constructive dialogue. And for us, it's really centered around the Meridian Speedway, which is part of the fastest route between the Southeast and the Southwest, which are the two fastest growing regions in the country. We're convinced that, that is only going to continue to grow. And we're going to make sure that we protect our shareholders and our customers' interest there. It's a big part of our plans moving forward. Operator : Thank you. At this time, this concludes the question-and-answer session. And I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Jim Squires for closing comments. Jim Squires : Thank you, everyone. We look forward to talking with you again next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may now disconnect your lines. And have a wonderful day.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Meghan Achimasi, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Meghan Achimasi : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Please note that during today\u2019s call we will make certain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and may differ materially from actual results. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. Our presentation slides are available at nscorp.com in the Investors section along with our reconciliation of non-GAAP measures used today to the comparable GAAP measures. Our full transcripts and download will be posted after the call. It is now my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern\u2019s President, Alan Shaw. Alan Shaw : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Norfolk Southern's first quarter 2022 earnings call. I am joined today by Cindy Sanborn, Chief Operating Officer; Ed Elkins, Chief Marketing Officer; and Mark George, Chief Financial Officer. I would like to start by recognizing the contributions of Norfolk Southern's employees who have worked safely and tirelessly to serve our customers and a challenging supply chain environment. I sincerely appreciate the commitment of our employees to Norfolk Southern and our customers. Norfolk Southern delivered solid financial performance in the first quarter with record first quarter revenue, earnings per share and net income. While our operating and marketing teams worked around the clock with our customers to address current network challenges and a dynamic supply chain. We know we need to improve service and are committed to increasing network fluidity and restoring service to levels our customers deserve. Cindy will share updates on our accelerated hiring and progress of our new operating plan, TOP SPG. Viewing the results for the quarter, you'll note that revenue increased 10% as a 16% increase in revenue per unit more than offset a 5% volume decline. Expenses grew over $200 million or 13% year-over-year, due primarily to a sharp increase in fuel price. Higher fuel costs, along with slower network velocity and reduced volume contributed to an increase in our operating ratio, which was up 130 basis points versus last year's first quarter record. We remain confident in our ability to improve service while simultaneously delivering productivity and growth. Our outlook is bright. I'll now turn the discussion to Cindy for an update on operations. Cindy? Cindy Sanborn : Thanks, Alan, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to talk to you all today about the outlook for our operations. During the past quarter, resource levels have challenged the fluidity of our operation, yet we have continued our momentum on increasing train size. We are in the very early days of seeing the fruits of our hiring initiatives and are working every avenue to improve service levels as quickly as possible. I'll provide an update on our Thoroughbred operating plan initiative as well as what we're doing with technology to make the railroad safer and more productive. First, turning to slide 6 as a recap of our operational activity metrics in the quarter, GTMs were down slightly, outperforming the unit volume decline as mix shifted modestly towards our heavier merchandise and coal segments. Our crew starts were down 5% in the quarter, which is a good news, bad news story. Resource levels prohibited us from operating some starts that we would have preferred to operate and our recovery mechanism was challenged as a result. However, on the positive side of the ledger, we continue to drive very beneficial road train consolidations across our segments, most pronounced in our boat franchise as we move similar coal tonnage with 6% fewer train starts and saw train weight up across the board for intermodal, merchandise and bulk. In an effort to improve resiliency, we kept a portion of the surge locomotive fleet active, yet we still achieved another quarter of fuel efficiency improvement. Turning to network performance on slide 7, train speed and terminal dwell closely resembled the levels they were at in the fourth quarter. Qualified T&E levels continued to decline throughout the quarter, culminating in what we expect to be the trough in March. As we start to see relief in certain areas, we are prioritizing crew starts that can have the most impact on customer service levels, and we are redeploying our go teams when possible. I want to reiterate that improving service levels is our top priority. And turning to slide 8, I will provide more detail on where we are with our hiring efforts. As we progress through 2021, we quickly identified the need to increase hiring within our transportation workforce. We were met with a very challenging labor market that made our ramp-up time longer than expected but we responded with a robust plan to streamline our pre-employment process, deploy a variety of financial incentives and mobilize additional onboarding resources. These efforts have paid off in a big way in 2022, and we now have over 800 conductor trainees on the property. As a result, we now expect our qualified T&E headcount to begin growing sequentially throughout the remainder of the year. We are laser focused on utilizing these additional employees to improve service levels and provide a solid platform from which to launch top SPG, which I will discuss on slide 9. As we did last quarter, I want to reiterate the approach of focusing on service, productivity and growth as equal pillars in our latest evolution of the top plan, which we envision launching in late second quarter. Let's talk about service quality and resiliency first. Several key elements of PSR are having a simple and executable operation as well as having a balance. You heard us talk about some of these PSR fundamentals when TOP21 was rolled out, and we now need to revisit a few of them with a renewed focus while ensuring they are embedded in all of our segments, including intermodal. One of the greatest strengths of our network is the quality and positioning of our intermodal franchise. And as we've performed the zero-based review of how we link together our major markets, we found opportunities to simplify how we connect those terminals while providing more capacity than what we have today. This will include ensuring we have assets flowing across our network in a balanced fashion so that less intervention is required for resources to be in the right place at the right time. Let me be clear, TOP SPG is another lever we're pulling to improve our service and represents an evolution of our current operating plan. This pathway towards enhanced service will allow us to better plan forward and execute longer trains. Additionally, going back to the idea of encompassing all business segments, while we've made great progress on enhancing book train sizes within coal, there is more runway ahead. Other facets of the bulk network such as grain, will see benefits as we develop the capability to run longer trains through those parts of the network, such as the mid west. This productivity dividend is very complementary to the service pillar as it will give us more flexibility to handle commodity volatility. These improvements in train productivity have obvious benefits of reducing labor intensity but will also propel further fuel efficiency improvements. Finally, these efforts will ensure that we grow capacity within our terminals and along our main lines, including the initiatives I've discussed with you before, to bolster our infrastructure with targeted siding extensions that are actively coming online. We are going to provide the capacity our customers want to grow with us organically while still creating the flexibility to respond quickly and effectively to new opportunities. Moving to our safety update on slide 10. We have seen improvement in both FRA train accidents per ton miles moved as well as the FRA injury index year-over-year. However, we will not be satisfied as long as there is a single injury or accident, which is why we continue our efforts to get better in this area every day. First, on the engagement front. In 2021, we conducted our first annual safety survey, which was across the entire workforce. This has provided us with insight on what and where we need to focus our engagement efforts. We've expanded our field training program to leverage outlets such as online training, classroom training and our signature safety train events so that we empower our workforce to actively engage in our goal of continuous improvement when it comes to safety. Lastly, we're making great progress building momentum with technology investments that are focused on safe and efficient operations, and I'll give a great example on slide 11 with an update where we are with one of our key technology pillars; automation. More specifically, we are using machine vision technology to detect component failures before they occur. We're in the process of deploying fully automated inspection corridors, which will cover more than 90% of the cars moving across our network using a variety of systems to detect signs and symptoms of pending failures before they occur. Equally as important as deploying the hardware is developing the next-generation AI algorithms that detect these failures with edge computing and procedures for intervening quickly. This is where we've made really exciting progress and we are already actively preventing incidents. We are finding that the technology is enabling us to achieve better outcomes than the human eyes alone can achieve. One reason for this is the power of seeing how these components are behaving on a train in motion versus well stationary during a manual inspection. We're generating high success rates with very few false positives and detecting components that need to be replaced, but had no outward indication to the human eye. The close and effective working relationship between our data scientists and field team is creating a feedback loop that is accelerating our progress. This is one of the most revolutionary technologies we are working on, and I'm extremely excited for what we are achieving with our relentless pursuit of safety first and productivity. I will now turn the call over to Ed. Ed Elkins : Thank you, Cindy, and good morning, everyone. If you would, let's turn to slide 13. Our results for the first quarter lagged challenges that we experienced on the volume side with supply chain constraints and network fluidity. These were offset by record success in revenue per unit. Overall, our volume decreased 5% year-over-year in the first quarter, driven by declines in our intermodal, automotive and steel franchises. But despite these volume declines, total revenue improved 10% year-over-year to $2.9 billion due to higher revenue from fuel surcharges and strong price gains. Within merchandise, volume declines were led by automotive and steel for chip supply and equipment cycle time challenges significantly inhibited our ability to drive growth. Partially offsetting these decreases were gains in agri fuels, feed and aggregates due to increased gasoline consumption, higher demand for agriculture products and rising levels of construction spending. Higher fuel revenue and price improvement more than offset the headwinds from volume and mix that generate 4% revenue growth year-over-year, along with record level revenue per unit. Revenue per unit less fuel was also a record for the quarter. Total intermodal shipments declined 6% in the first quarter, driven almost entirely by the international market where tight drayage capacity, high street dwell for chassis and warehouse throughput drove customers to seek alternatives to Inland Point Intermodal, or IPI. Domestic shipments grew modestly year-over-year on sustained consumer demand that outpaced supply. However, as network velocity improves, and as top SPG is implemented, we're confident that we will provide the capacity our customers need to grow. Higher revenue from fuel surcharges was the leading driver of intermodal revenue growth this quarter, followed by storage revenue, price improvement and positive mix, all leading the record quarterly revenue metrics for the franchise. Intermodal revenue per unit less fuel grew for the 21st consecutive quarter. Now moving to coal. Total volume was down slightly year-over-year in the first quarter as gains in utility shipments were offset by declines in export coal. Utility growth was driven by higher levels of demand for electric power and the need to replenish depleted inventories. Our export franchise experienced a number of acute service disruptions that limited shipments for a period of time, resulting in a year-over-year decline. But despite these volume headwinds, coal revenue grew 25%, primarily due to price gains, underscoring the near-term market demand opportunities we effectively secured. Revenue per unit and revenue per unit less fuel reached record levels this quarter. Now let's turn to slide 14 for our market outlook for the remainder of 2022. In general, we anticipate continued, consumer driven strength in demand and improvements in our service product. Both of these will enable us to deliver year-over-year volume and revenue growth in 2022. However, we are closely monitoring a base of uncertainty in the macro economy, including inflation at levels we haven't seen in over 40 years, rising interest rates and evolving post-pandemic labor market and ongoing global geopolitical conflict. Merchandise volume growth will be led by agriculture, forest and consumer products where we're seeing elevated demand for products such as soybeans and corn as global food supply chains face ongoing uncertainty. The USDA recently increased their expectations for export soybeans from the US amid declining foreign availability and highlighted rising demand for corn, both of which create opportunities for rail transportation. Also contributing to volume gains will be automotive for US light vehicle production is expected to improve 19% year-over-year in the month of April through December on improving chip supply. Total construction spending in the US has been steadily increasing since mid-2020 and currently sits at the highest level on record, signaling opportunities for our construction related markets. Within intermodal, our expectation is for a healthy and resilient consumer in 2022 based on a strong balance sheet, suggest an increased spending power from excess savings despite record high inflationary pressures. Growth in the consumer led economy will drive demand for our domestic intermodal service, which we expect will benefit from service improvements in the second half of the year and drive growth to offset the volume declines that we experienced at the start of the year. Sustained tightness in the truck market and rising diesel fuel prices are both contributing to an economic environment that encourages highway to rail conversion and provides a superior value proposition for our customers because of our fuel efficiency advantage, especially when compared to the highway. For our international franchise, we're working diligently to create the capacity our channel partners need to take advantage of the opportunities on Norfolk Southern. Our efforts are expected to boost volume recovery and drive year-over-year growth in intermodal this year. And lastly, turning to coal. Record high seaborne prices continue in an already strong market that is amplified by geopolitical tensions. This will provide opportunities in the near-term. Pricing is expected to remain a tailwind in the export markets. Utility shrink continues with higher natural gas prices though it will continue to be counteracted by higher coal prices. Inventories are still lower than target heading into the summer season. In our domestic met market, consumer demand remains high for domestic receivers. Coal supply availability and production remain tight in every market, which will be the determining factor and upside potential. Overall, we're confident in the growth potential for Norfolk Southern for the remainder of the year. And we expect to deliver revenue and volume growth over last year. I would like to thank our customers for their partnership and reiterate that we remain intently focused on improving service and driving value for our customers and shareholders. I will now turn it over to Mark for an update on our financial results. Thank you. Mark George : Thank you, Ed. I'm on slide 16. We delivered double-digit revenue and EPS growth in the first quarter. Both were record levels for NS. Starting with revenues, the 10% growth was despite the 5% volume decline, thanks to the strong RPU growth that Ed just detailed. Operating expenses were up 13%, driven in large part by a sharp increase in fuel prices, but also higher costs related to our network challenges. Despite revenue dollar growth exceeding OpEx dollar growth, we experienced a 130 basis point increase in our operating ratio. Recall that at the first quarter conferences, we previewed pressure on our OR, compared to our original expectation of flattish sequentially due to lighter volumes that we were experiencing to start the year and also the rapid rise in fuel expense. The way it landed, fuel prices alone represented 100 basis points of OR headwind relative to our expectations as well as year-over-year. We also booked an accrual adjustment within claims expense that created another 40 basis points of headwind. The volume shortfall also adversely impacted OR as we previewed, along with incremental service related costs. These were only partially offset by the strong RPU improvements. OR side, the operating income and earnings per share were both Q1 records growing 7% and 10%, respectively. Drilling into the breakdown of operating expenses in the quarter on slide 17, you'll see that 60% of the $206 million increase in the quarter was from higher fuel prices on a year-over-year basis. Purchased services was up $31 million or 10%, driven in large part from inflation and service related costs that more than offset benefits that would typically come from lower volumes. Equipment rents increased $13 million or 17%, driven by slower network velocity and less equity earnings from TTX. The $20 million increase in materials and others is driven by a $13 million accrual adjustment in claims related to the 2017 through 2020 years based on an actuarial study. Comp and benefits were up 1%, with compensation inflation offsetting savings from lower employee levels in several categories. Qualified T&E employees were down mostly offset by conductor trainees. The unwanted attrition of qualified T&E employees drove higher overtime cost to move the freight. Shifting to slide 18. In a discussion of the P&L below operating income, other income was a $5 million expense in the quarter, driven largely by losses on the company owned life insurance investments. Pre-tax income was up 5%, while net income was up 4%. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 23%, in line with the 23% to 24% range that we guide. EPS was up 10% on the 4% net income growth, thanks to nearly 2.2 million shares repurchased in the quarter. We're moving nearly 1% of the outstanding shares. Closing with cash flow and shareholder distributions on slide 19, free cash flow was $605 million, down 19% from last year due to property additions in Q1 this year that are $124 million higher. Recall Q1 2021 property additions were quite low to start the year, due in part to weather. Free cash flow conversion in the first quarter was a healthy 86%. Despite a lower free cash flow year-over-year, shareholder distributions were nearly 7% higher with a 19% higher dividend payment and modestly higher share repurchases. We'll now turn it back to Alan for a wrap up. Alan Shaw : Thank you, Mark. Turning to slide 20. We show multiple approaches on how we're building upon our record of sustainability leadership. With the launch of our next-generation carbon calculator in mid-March, we've made it easier for customers to do business with us, incorporating carbon into their freight decision framework with quantifiable benefits of utilizing the most efficient and least carbon intensive mode of ground transportation. Also in March, we announced the continuation of our locomotive modernization program in partnership with Witek, which will improve our operational performance and reliability and help us achieve our science based target emission reductions, up 42% by 2034. The pace of our sustainability initiatives has increased and is recognized in the industry as evidenced by several prestigious awards received in the quarter, including named as supplier engagement leader by Carbon Disclosure Project for 2021 recognized with the 2022 Green Bond of the Year award from Environmental Finance and earning the Responsible Care Energy Efficiency Award for locomotive fuel efficiency, from the American Chemistry Council. We are incredibly proud of our progress in this area, and we will continue to build upon our sustainability initiatives, which are good for business and the right thing to do for all of our stakeholders. Let me close by confirming our commitment to deliver our targets this year. Our confidence at this stage is based on our assessment of economic indicators, which at this time remain supportive of manufacturing and consumer activity as well as our service recovery efforts associated with accelerated hiring and the successful implementation of TOP SPG. These factors will support healthy volume growth in the back half of the year. In fact, potential upside exists to our revenue outlook and energy prices remain elevated throughout the year. As you've heard from our entire team, we are disappointed with our current service levels. We are laser focused on restoring the quality of our product to a level that allows our customers to succeed and grow. We are confident that our decisive actions to restore service, including hiring and the launch of TOP SPG will create long-term sustained value for our customers and shareholders, leveraging our unique franchise strengths. Before we open the call to questions, I want to take the opportunity to thank our retiring CEO, Jim Squires for his tremendous leadership to our company over the past 30 years. During Jim's tenure as CEO, NS improved our operating ratio by more than 1,200 basis points, more than doubled our market cap and returned over $17 billion to our shareholders. He led our company through the challenges of our freight recession and global pandemic. Jim launched an industry leading digital transformation strategy, elevated sustainability to a strategic business priority and personally championed diversity and inclusion. And Jim united our team and the new headquarters in Midtown Atlanta last year. On behalf of all NS employees, retirees and stakeholders. Thank you, Jim, and we wish you and your family all the best in your well-earned retirement. We will now open the call to questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Chris Wetherbee : Hey, great. Thanks and good morning everybody. Maybe I just wanted to start on the outlook for the rest of the year, particularly on the operating ratio side. So I know fuel, I think, Mark, you said it was 100 basis points in the first quarter and presumably, it could be elevated and be a bit of a headwind to operating ratio in the subsequent few quarters. So I wanted to get a sense of whether the 50 to 100 basis points of OR improvement is excluding fuel or inclusive of fuel. And if it is inclusive, kind of, curious what, sort of, the incremental productivity opportunities you see that we'll be able to sustain that 50 to 100 basis points? Alan Shaw : Hey, Chris, this is Alan. Thanks for the question. We've got multiple paths to achieve that OR target that we put out there. And certainly, improving service is, first and foremost among those. It allows us to take on more volume, absorb costs. And as we bring more business on to the network, it comes with higher incremental margins. We did see some modest improvement in our network capacity in March. And as a result, we saw sequential volume improvements in March as well, which really helped out the trajectory of our OR within the quarter. If you look at the markets in which we're serving, we've got a stronger coal outlook. Commodity pricing certainly helps, and we should see OR improvement sequentially throughout the year. And to be clear, we're talking about OR, including fuel. The headwind that we saw in the first quarter associated with sharply rising fuel prices is something that the OR headwind, pardon me. It's something we don't anticipate as we move forward throughout the year. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Brandon Oglenski : Hey good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Alan, I guess, can you just talk more about TOP SPG or maybe this one is for Cindy, too. Is this the new operating plan, or is that like the strategy guiding the new operating plan that you guys intend to launch later this quarter? And can you just give us some details on what's going to be implemented change-wise that can get you to better service outcomes? Thank you. Cindy Sanborn : Hi, Brandon, this is Cindy. I'll take the question. Thanks for the question. So think of TOP SPG as a continuation of TOP21 with a pause for a pandemic in the middle. We worked on our manifest network in 2019, so two very, very great results from a service perspective. So we are now moving from the manifest to looking at intermodal specifically. The three main things that we're pulling from our analysis of where we are is -- where we want to be is balancing the network, executability of the plan and embedded in that is train size. And so those are the main initiatives around TOP21 generally and as it applies to intermodal specifically. We also have some secondary thoughts around what we expect the intermodal product to look like that include outlet frequency as well as blocking density. So got a lot that we're working on looking at that product and basically taking a very unconstrained view and then building up into what we think that's going to look like. And as we noted, it would be -- we'd probably implement that towards the second half of -- back half of this quarter. And, obviously, with great communication with our employees as well as our customers. So we're largely in that phase of it. And then as we continue from there, we're going to look at our bulk network. We have -- we've seen some great efficiencies in the numbers. And in my prepared remarks, I talked about both train size and efficiencies there. And we've seen that really in our Lamberts Point coal market coming out of West Virginia going down to the port with export coal. But we think with opportunities both from a standpoint of doubling up trains other than those types of trains, it could be trains coming over Chicago to interchange as well as our own grain trains. And then secondly, behind that, on our local service for our bulk network, that's origin destination payer on an as, we think there's opportunity just to grow train size generally. We've seen some improvement with one of our metals customers in that regard, and we've got more work to do there. So I think what you'll see is as we implement it in the back half of the quarter, it will start with intermodal, and then we'll layer in and add into that over the course of the year, the bulk opportunities. Brandon Oglenski : Appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Jon Chappell : Thank you. Good morning. Ed, when you break down the revenue variance of the different groups, for intermodal and coal, especially, this rate mix and other component is pretty tremendous. Is there any way to kind of further parse out what is pure rate and potentially stickier going forward as we think about RPU as volumes start to inflect positively? And how much of it is maybe more temporary along the lines of storage, et cetera? Ed Elkins : Sure. And thank you for the question. We have a strong environment out there for demand, for our services, and that includes, of course, price associated with that. Price is a little bit north of one-third in terms of the total composition. I will tell you that storage is another component there later on top of that pure price number. And we expect, as service improves, this year. And as supply chains improved throughout the year, we're going to see that storage number decline as the steamship lines in particular, require less storage and are able to deliver more throughput capacity. Jon Chappell : Okay. So just to be clear, that one-third of price, is that intermodal and coal, or was that just intermodal and coal maybe is a bigger\u2026 Ed Elkins : That's the whole shooting match. That's our portfolio. Jon Chappell : Got it. All right. Thank you Ed. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott Group : Hey thanks, good morning. And best of luck to you, Jim. Mark, I wanted to just ask the -- any thoughts on the operating ratio for second quarter just to help give us some comfort on the bridge to the full year guidance? And then Ed, just on the RPU less fuel for merchandise, it was only up 3%, which just feels a little light given the pricing environment and the inflationary environment. Does that get incrementally better from here, do you think? Mark George : You want to start first? Alan Shaw : I'll start first with the last question on price. We -- I think you're right familiar with the composition of our portfolio in general, which mean every year, about half of our business comes up for pricing. We've still got probably a majority of that to go for the year on merchandise. And we are expecting to continue to deliver value in the form of yield based off the demand that we see out there, and as our ability to deliver capacity for that demand continues to improve this year. We have a contract portfolio that's stacked with not only long-term contracts that you're all familiar with, but also the short-term. We're testing the short-term right now. And we're delivering what we call very encouraging results. I would also say this, our customers are also delivering some encouraging results on their own that they're reporting to us in terms of their ability to attract new business and price. Mark George : And Scott, with regard to the operating ratio, obviously, we've stuck to our guidance for the full year. And we're going to see progressive improvement sequentially as we go through the year with more of the improvement really in the back half as we enjoy the recovery in service and in particular, in the fourth quarter. But I don't want to get any more granular with that given the dynamics in the marketplace. Scott Group : Would you still expect it to be worse year-over-year in 2Q? Mark George : Well, remember in 2Q, we had a fairly large property gain that was -- really had a good lowering effect on our operating ratio. So all in year-over-year, it would be really hard to get close to that number, but it will be certainly better than where we are right now. We saw within the first quarter, the operating ratio -- the rate of operating ratio improvement from January and February when volumes were very muted to what we saw in February -- in the month of March was a pretty nice improvement. And I expect that in the second quarter with volumes at least holding at these levels and perhaps starting to ramp up a little bit, we'll see a nice jump. But Q2 is a very tough compare because of that that land sale that we had called out. Scott Group : Yeah. Okay. Thank you guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Jason Seidl : Thank you, Operator. You guys mentioned that there could be some upside to the numbers if fuel remains high. I'm assuming that could come in the form of intermodal and coal as well on the export or maybe even domestic side. Could you talk a little bit about how you're equipped to handle that business in terms of the fluidity of the network? And then are there any investments needed in the coal franchise,, which we all know has not been getting ramped up over the last four, five years? Mark George : Yeah, sure. Let's talk about coal specifically. That's been a market that's been supported by price driven by capacity tightness. And with the current geopolitical disruptions that are out there, the market's got even hotter. And so we are very well equipped, I believe, with our franchise going to the labors point to deliver value for our customers and for the marketplace on the export side. And that includes -- we are ensuring that we have the fleet necessary to deliver that value. We know that there's some incremental capacity coming on later this year. And so we are working right now to repair those portions of the fleet that are needed so that we have a good order fleet of coal cars that can deliver value over Lamberts Point as well as to the rest of our customers that rely on that fleet. Cindy Sanborn : And as far as the network is concerned, you mentioned intermodal as well. I mean, obviously, the hiring that we're doing and you see the numbers and number of qualified employees starting to tick up. We expect that to continue through the quarter. I'm very, very optimistic about that. And I think that as that starts to be felt, I think, in addition, the intermodal impact -- intermodal TOP SPG focus is also going to help us in the intermodal side. It really does do -- it's completely streamlined between terminal operations and road operations to drive some of the efficiencies that I described before. So I think that will give us a great platform for being able to meet much more of the demand that we're meeting right now. Mark George : And to reiterate, our customers wants to grow. And on the intermodal side, in particular, we're blessed with a great portfolio of customers who are investing for growth in 2022, and we're making sure that we're going to be able to deliver for them. With the way fuel prices are currently, we have a compelling product in the marketplace, which will only become more compelling as we're able to deliver more capacity. Cindy Sanborn : And I guess I would add one more on coal\u2026 Alan Shaw : Go ahead. I'm sorry, Cindy. Cindy Sanborn : Yeah, Jason, on coal, I should have also mentioned, we really have had a solid service product to the port throughout the year. And part of what you've heard me talk about, and I referenced it in my prepared remarks around train size has been the demand that we've seen, being able to double those trains up and operate the tons with less labor intensity has been consistent throughout the year, and we expect it to continue. Jason Seidl : Great. Let me just send my best wishes to Jim before I sign off. Everyone, thanks for the time as always. Alan Shaw : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Brian Ossenbeck : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So Cindy, sticking with you, obviously, the STB is having the hearing on urgent service issues. It seems like they want some improvement here in the next 30 to 60 days. So I wanted to see if there's anything in particular that you had in the pipeline. If you could maybe accomplish that, that you haven't really talked about yet here? And then also, when you think about retention, obviously, a lot of the service improvement contests contingent rather upon that inflection. But are you all concerned about retention of the trainee size staying at the rate it is retention of the more experienced people on the line of road? How are you feeling about that? What's your level of confidence in there, are there any other actions you can take to increase that retention level? Thank you. Alan Shaw : Hi, good morning Brian. Thanks for the question. I'm going to start with that and then turn it over to Cindy. And just to be crystal clear, restoring service is the top priority of this entire leadership and every employee at Norfolk Southern. Personally, I've been out in the field and I've been in our dispatch center, and I really see the pride that our employees have in serving our customers and serving our -- serving the US economy. I'm really encouraged by the employee engagement, and I'm very encouraged about the steps that we're taking right now to restore our service product to where it needs to be. Cindy Sanborn : And Brian, yeah, I saw you yesterday at the STB hearings. The focus of the committee around of the Board around trying to restore service as quickly as possible. We are lockstep in line with that mindset. And other -- I think we have brought to bear everything we can to do just that. I can't think of anything that I heard yesterday that helps move it forward any faster. So we're going to -- as Alan has noted, we are laser focused on this. So I think a TOP SPG will help us. I mean there's just a number of initiatives that we have already. And I think those are the ones that we're going to -- we'll stick with, and I think they will bear fruit for us. In terms of the retention of trainees, that is something that we look at and make our hiring decisions based on that and they differ between some of the hiring groups that we have. We have put in signing bonuses at various levels based on attracting trainees and clearly outline what the job is to trainees and makes -- work very hard to make sure that we do keep the ones that we get in. That said, one of the things that we also do once they are on and training is provide the work life in terms of being on call and working different shifts and working weekends in the training program to make sure they really do understand what it is we're expecting as a railroad employee. And to some extent, that may accelerate attrition, but that attrition comes early rather than later because it would ultimately come. So we feel like that's the best way to make sure that we manage the -- a promoted trainee very effectively or the promoted conductor very effectively by trying to manage it on the front end. But we do see high attrition in the training ranks, but we plan for that. Brian Ossenbeck : Okay. So just to summarize, it does feel like you're communicating is you are at an inflection point in terms of getting the T&E, the right number of people in the right place? Cindy Sanborn : Well, you're seeing it on the slide that we showed with qualified teen, it's starting to tick up and looking at our hiring locations and the number of trainees that we have in place, we are in flight right now. We feel really good about being -- seeing good -- as we started the second quarter and ended in the second quarter, we will see improvement across that timeline and acceleration from that. So I'm really enthusiastic about where we stand. Alan Shaw : And you couple that with the implementation of TOP SPG late this quarter and a number of other specific tactical initiatives that Cindy has every day to improve the quality of our service and our labor utilization. We've got a good runway ahead of us. Brian Ossenbeck : Okay. Thank you for the time. Appreciated. Alan Shaw : Thanks Brian. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Jordan Alliger : Yeah, hi. Just a follow-up on TOP SPG. I'm wondering, I know the deployment is forthcoming. How long would you see -- how long do you think it will take to actually fully deploy and start to see the benefits? Is this something that you start to see the impact relatively quickly? And then just as a follow-up, I'm assuming I can't remember completely that intermodal planning was part of the original PSR efforts three or so years ago. So is this just a function of three years in, hey, these are adjustments we need to make because something is not working completely right? Thank you. Cindy Sanborn : Yeah, Jordan. I would say that it's really just, as I described, unconstrained approach. I mean, things have changed over time post-pandemic included. And the original TOP21 was -- the plan was to continue on with intermodal. And there are certain trains that could actually carry both. And that does exist today, and we probably have an opportunity or two to have it in the new version here. But this is -- it's really about, again, take an unconstrained approach and figuring out how to balance our network, make sure we have a good executable plan and improve train size. So those are the main tenants of what the output should be. Now in terms of benefits, I mean, intermodal is about 20% of our crew starts. So we will see it affecting that part of our business and we'll implement schedule changes and those types of things as we roll it out fairly quickly. So I feel like that one will see some benefits as we get into the third quarter. But then we'll move on to the bulk side. So I think it will be TOP SPG generally will be something that allow -- it will be something that will take longer than just the intermodal portion that will continue on through the year and beyond in some cases where we have bulk opportunities in places where there's some physical infrastructure constraints. Alan Shaw : Cindy, I think we think of it as a process of continual improvement. Cindy Sanborn : Yeah, absolutely. Jordan Alliger : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Ken Hoexter : Good morning, and Jim, again, best of luck and Alan and Cindy, I know everybody has been harping on this, but maybe if I can maybe come at it a different way, on PSR was all about resilience and something goes wrong, it kind of fixed itself. We're now in the second phase of it with TOP SPG. So maybe you could just dumb it down for me. Is it just employees that you need that -- as the STB said you kind of overdid it, now you've got to get them to get the service back? Is it that the plan wasn't the rightfully built plan and now you kind of need to fix it and you talked about keeping a surge locomotive fleet. So what is it that needs to get the fluidity up? And then on the tail end of that, you've talked a lot about intermodal and the shift of freight east, yet international volumes down 20%. I guess, is that part of this equation of not enough employees at the congestion still on the network, maybe walk through what has to happen to clean that up as well? Thanks a lot. Alan Shaw : Thanks, Ken. With respect to how we're approaching this thing, I mean, to be clear, our first priority is restoring our service. And our entire organization laser focused on delivering that objective. Once we've gotten that near-term goal, we are going to perform a retrospective analysis on how we got into this position. And we're going to understand what signals we missed, how we can improve the process and what mitigates we can put in place going forward. For us, we firmly believe that right now, it's a combination of our employee level and our service plan, which is why we very quickly implemented decisively initiatives to increase our hiring and to redesign our operating plan. That redesign of the operating plan is going to improve our balance, it's going to improve the simplicity of our product, and it's going to improve the executability of our product, which is going to help the service product in all three of our franchises. Ed, do you want to talk specifically about international intermodal? Ed Elkins : Sure, absolutely. And thanks for the question. In terms of the Intercontinental supply chain, which delivers products to the US consumer from -- primarily from Asia, but from other places, well, there's been tremendous volatility as everybody on this call already knows. Not only our supply chain stress in the US, and that includes really all the components of that supply chain, which are the ports, warehouses, railroads, truckers, retailers and other outlet venues. But it also includes the lines themselves on the water and in -- at the port of origin. So there's been a lot of volatility there. We have seen steamship lines make decisions that really allow themselves to have more flexibility. And then part of that is because of the congestion, which we've experienced, which is supply chain experience. But we're seeing some very encouraging signs in terms of where that goes going forward. We believe that intermodal still offers substantial value not only for the state line, but for their customers, especially in a high fuel environment or a high fuel price environment. We think there's a compelling story there that we can deliver value for over the long-term. And as we see those supply chains start to loosen up this year as the lockdowns in Asia continue to ease, we hope, we're going to see, we believe, customers look to IPI again for a way to add value on the inland supply chains. But there's a few forward-looking indicators or leading indicators that we want to look at, that's warehouse availability, drayage capacity? It's a dynamic situation. Ken Hoexter : Wonderful, Alan. I appreciate the time. Thanks guys. Alan Shaw : Thank you Ken. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Ravi Shanker : Thanks. Morning everyone. Jim, best of luck from us as well. I had a couple of questions on train length. Just to understand that a little bit better, there's increasing train length at a time when, obviously, network fluidity is not great and service is challenging. Does that help or hurt at the current moment? Obviously, I get the long-term benefits of increasing train length. But at this time, I just wanted to check if it helps or hurts. And as a follow-up to that, I know the STB is very focused on service levels as a whole, but there's also been some scrutiny on train length specifically especially at a congressional level and some reasonable shippers as well. So I'm just wondering if there's a natural limit to that or if there's demising returns over time? Thanks. Cindy Sanborn : Ravi, thanks. I think train length really helps us right now. It improves our lessons or labor intensity. Now there's a point to, which if you're unable to meet trains at multiple locations on a particular district, it could work against you to your point. But I think where we are finding opportunities to move more traffic with one crew that is really to our advantage. So I don't see it working against us both near-term, nor do I see it working against us long term. We want to be able to match our train size to our locomotive pulling capability. And as we invest in locomotives and you've heard me talk about that in our prepared remarks, with DC/AC conversions, it's very helpful to us to improve train length. From the standpoint of what the STB might do, I don't know. I know that it is a topic that even FRA brings up from time-to-time. But I truly believe that the technology that's brought to us with distributed power capability makes it a very safe and effective operation. I don't see a reason that we should expect or want or think necessary, any restrictions on train length as long as we're continuing to move fluidly and not getting longer than the district that we need to run on. Ravi Shanker : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Amit Mehrotra : Thanks. Hi, everyone. Mark, you\u2019ve been helpful in the past talking about the cadence of absolute cost. I mean, I think we're in a somewhat uncertain volume environment as we look out six to nine months. I think it would be helpful to get your perspective on what you have visibility on, which is the absolute cost structure. So can you talk about at $1.8 billion in the first quarter, where you expect the cost structure to -- how do you expect it to move over the next few quarters? And then I just had one clarifying question. When you talked about the year-on-year change on the second quarter OR, I fully understand the land gain, bringing that down. But it was -- I think it's 60.3% excluding that. Do you expect to be better than that or worse than that year-over-year, or is it sequentially kind of the right way we should think about it for the second quarter? Mark George : Thanks, Amit. Look, yeah, we ended this first quarter with absolute costs in that 18, 30 [ph] range. And -- when I look out from here, there'll be a step-up even excluding fuel, I think as volumes start to rise, we'll see probably a step up in absolute cost for sure. But I would still think inclusive of fuel, we're going to stay under that $1.9 billion level throughout each of the quarters going forward. Now with regard to the year-over-year change in OR in the second quarter, again, I really don\u2019t want to get into any more specifics than to say we could -- we have a good chance to be in that range, ex fuel, but I don't want to put more of a finer point on it than that -- I'm sorry, not ex fuel, ex the land gain from due two of last year. I'm hopeful we can be in that range. But there's too many variables. I don't really want to put a fine point on it. Amit Mehrotra : Okay. I appreciate you talking about the cost structure. It\u2019s very helpful. Thank you very much. Mark George : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens Inc. Please proceed with your question. Justin Long : Thanks and good morning. I know that 2022 guidance for high single-digit revenue growth didn't change, but is it possible to share what you're assuming for full year volume growth within that outlook. And looking at the second quarter specifically, do you think there's the opportunity for volumes to inflect positively year-over-year? Alan Shaw : Yeah. Thank you for the question. We believe that not only is the US economy poised to continue to deliver growth for transportation providers who can add value, but we think that the consumer demand is going to continue here at least for the foreseeable future. And you layer in some high commodity prices and some geopolitical conflict. And we believe that the US is very well-positioned in the current environment, despite some of those headwinds that we all know about in terms of rate increases and higher fuel prices. That being said, we know that as we improve our service, as we deliver more capacity that our customers want to grow, they're poised to grow and we're going to be able to deliver that growth. So yes, I would say we're sticking with our view that we're going to be able to deliver growth for the full year in terms of volume. Mark George : Yeah. Second quarter, in particular, was not necessarily going to be as ramp back half, so we're going to ramp toward the back half as service improves. Justin Long : Okay, got it. And maybe a quick follow-up on TOP SPG. I was curious if you could share how much additional capacity you think that will create in the domestic intermodal network specifically. And if we get into an environment where domestic intermodal volumes are increasing double digits, I just want to get some color on your ability to handle that over the remainder of the year? Cindy Sanborn : Yeah, Justin, I'll mention the secondary -- kind of, the secondary order of business on TOP SPG, particularly intermodal, is to look at outlet frequency as well as blocking density that will help us be able to be as efficient as possible in our terminals and obviously then operate trains that support that. So that is a big component of the plan and how we're thinking about it, because we want to make sure that we build it with a platform to grow. Justin Long : Okay. I appreciate the time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Walter Spracklin : Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to come back to the regulatory question and really some of the concerns that are raised generally about rail service. And we're hearing it now from a number of different sources, not just the STB, but from other organizations, Federal Maritime Commission, Secretary of Transportation and so forth. And I know in Canada, the regulator did make efforts to regulate service, and it was complicated and it created a fairly high level of uncertainty as the regulator tried to step in and regulate on service. Do you see any concern that -- and I know there was some calling for that that the regulator here in the US would look to follow suit and what form might that take? And do you have any concern whether that will affect your ultimate profitability if the regular starts to move in on regulating service levels? Alan Shaw : Yeah, Walter, that's part of that is a hypothetical as to what form could potentially take. I can tell you that we are completely aligned with our customers and our shareholders and our regulators on the intent and the focus on delivering value to our customers. And we have every economic incentive and are self-motivated to fix this problem. And as a result, we are staying actively engaged with the STB. You saw Ed and Cindy and Annie represent Norfolk Southern in the industry yesterday in that venue. And I think what you heard from them is that we are entirely focused on restoring our service levels. That's our commitment. Walter Spracklin : Thanks so much for the answer. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Tom Wadewitz : Yeah, good morning. Thanks for the chance to ask the question here. The -- I guess, I mean, you've talked a lot about crew and SPG adding capacity or crew additions. What -- do you need to do one before you do the other, or I guess -- and how would you think, like, would you expect to see velocity improve before you make some of the schedule changes? I guess, I'm just thinking about related to execution risk when you make the schedule changes or perhaps they're incremental in the way you roll them out, and there's not a whole lot of execution. But I wanted to ask about those two initiatives and just how you would link them together and how you need to do them? Cindy Sanborn : Yeah, Tom. Well, I would tell you, if I pivot back to TOP21 when we've come out of 2018 with a lot of real service challenges and implemented TOP21, really, really effectively, and it went extremely well. So we're kind of using that as an experience that we've had to implement changes in operating plans. But at the same time, we have not completely finished the plan yet, and we will engage our employees and obviously, our customers to make sure that how we implement it is the most effective way that we can implement it. And it is meant to be positive towards our service product. And if we need to do it more in a more sequential manner for that to support that, that's how we'll do it. Tom Wadewitz : So do you -- I mean, do you think velocity needs to be 20 miles an hour before you implement something, or would you say they're not necessarily connected in terms of how well you're running before you make the schedule changes? Cindy Sanborn : Yeah. I think that the result of the implementation should help to lift velocity. And I don't think there's a gate of how fast we should be operating before we start something. And these will obviously be very localized changes. So we'll give those line segments a really good look before we actually implement. But I don't think there's a gate, at which we have to be at a certain speed or a certain dwell in order to implement. But we'll be very thoughtful as we implement to make sure it's supportive of improvement in service and not creating problems associated with that. Alan Shaw : Tom, there's a dual path here, right? At the same time, we're implementing TOP SPG. We're going to start getting healthier with our crew base. And I'm very confident in the ability of our team out in the field to execute this. Mark George : I might just add, TOP21 that we did in 2019 was really in hindsight, a revolutionary operating plan change that unlocked a tremendous amount of productivity that we harvested. I think TOP SPG is more of an evolution from that now, where we're looking to get back into an operating plan that we can execute on a more reliable manner and also resource more reliably because that's where we're dealing with the challenges on the crew resource. So what happened in the middle was the pandemic that really altered a lot of our traffic flows and our traffic mixes or commodity mixes, I should say. And that's really what necessitates us to evolve the plan a little bit and try to get back into balance. So that's one way to think of TOP SPG. So now as we go when we release the new plan, which is being -- we're going through iterations right now, internally and then ultimately with our customers, hopefully, we'll end up with more crews on the ground and we'll be able to execute in a much more predictable fashion. So they're kind of happening simultaneously. Tom Wadewitz : And we see the result more in 3Q or in 2Q on velocity, let's say? Mark George : Yeah, I would imagine we'll start to see it more pronounced than 3Q. That's not to say that we're not looking for opportunities here in 2Q to inflect upward. Tom Wadewitz : Okay. Thanks for all the time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please proceed with your question. Cherilyn Radbourne : Thanks very much and good morning. I just had another one on TOP SPG and the emphasis on the train size to drive productivity. So Cindy, I wonder if you could give us some perspective on where train size sits today and what you think the upside is as you leverage distributed power and make siding extensions and how you'd rank the remaining opportunity for train size improvement in bulk merchandise and intermodal? Thanks. Cindy Sanborn : Cherilyn, thanks for the question. I think that you've seen train size incrementally improve over many quarters. Some of that is bringing volume on to existing trains. And that's just absorbing volume coming to us. So as we came out of the pandemic, and we had more volume coming to us, we just added to existing trains. And then there's a piece of it that's a little bit more structural. And that structural piece can be in the bulk network where we can double trains up or where we can actually increase train size by 20 cars, let's say, in our green network or so forth because that matches the pulling power of our locomotives. So as you see mix changes happen with the intermodal or bulk or manifest, that will impact what the high end of our opportunity set is, but what we're really doing is matching the train to the locomotive pulling power and capability. And as -- and I don't -- we really don't think of it as this is the output we're trying to get to. We more think about it incrementally and structurally how we can change it to improve it. But the distributed power is what's unlocking that opportunity. The technology associated with distributed power is what's unlocking that opportunity. And you're seeing us invest in our locomotives, the rebuild locomotives all come equipped with distributed power is helping us continue to do that. The locomotive fleet over the years from 2016, we started this process of DC to AC conversions has incrementally added to our ability to take on train size. So that's how we think about it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Nolan with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Ben Nolan : Yeah, hi. Actually, Cindy, I wanted to follow-up on that a little bit. You talked about, I think, specifically in the intermodal part of the business that were some positive mix in there in the first quarter. And I assume that, obviously, that's the effort going forward. But how do you balance out trying to just add volume on an absolute basis versus also trying to add the premium volume that generates better margins. It's got to be a little challenging to do both at the same time, right? Cindy Sanborn : Yeah. So we think about it in terms of balance. We think about in terms of executability. And I talked a little bit about outlet frequency. In some cases, we're running certain, several trains between two different cities but they're going to two different ramps. So how do we think about taking those two trains and getting outlets for our customers more frequently to be able to get to the destination cities and not think so hard about specifically what ramp we're going to. So that's some of what is embedded in our thinking. And then how simplify -- how can we simplify the building of the train with blocking density and being able to make blocks that are bigger. So there's a lot that goes into the inputs of how we balance train size and the internal components of how we operate the trains and the terminals between, which we operate them. Alan Shaw : Cindy, I would add that as we strike balance, we strike simplicity and we add crews, our train performance is going to improve. Train speed is going to improve. The quality of our product is going to improve and that's going to add more business to existing trades. And so just from that standpoint, even without a design change, we're going to add train length and train weight. Mark George : That's exactly right. Now I would say -- just to add one other thing. The structure of our network is such that we are blessed with a lot of optionality here, both in terms of the cities that we serve, the major metropolitan areas, but also multiple robust facilities within those metro areas, which we're going to leverage to deliver a simplified and effective train plan for our customers. Ben Nolan : All right. Appreciate. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. David Vernon : Hi, good morning. I had a question for you on somewhat related to service issues, but if you think about the volume inflecting in the back half of the year, adding some congestion to the network, do you worry at all that, that might delay the recovery at least in the metrics themselves? And do you have any time frame for when we should be expecting service to kind of normalize or return to a better level? I know we're talking about inflection here in the second, third quarter, but when you think about getting fully restored, do you have a time frame for what that might look like? Cindy Sanborn : Yeah. So I think what we've talked about is we're really confident in the pace of improvement this quarter and into the future quarters. Very dynamic environment we're dealing with. So it's hard to say when will \u2013 quote, unquote \u2013 \u201cbe back.\u201d But it's a very positive trajectory that we expect. And from a congestion standpoint, as we speed up, by definition, congestion will ease. So as we bring, it will be much easier to bring on volume because we are less congested. So we really -- the idea is to start with crew resources and plan changes to a lesser extent, but still supportive to the idea of being able to operate the railroad in a much less congested manner than we see, which will be reflected in our train speak going out. David Vernon : Okay. Thanks for that. And then just as a quick follow-up, terminal capacity, your third-party contractors that are running some of the intermodal terminals. And we've certainly heard a lot about service issues there as well. As you think about the resourcing that you're doing, can you comment at all around the resourcing that's happening at some of the terminal operations and when some of those sort of engage out problems might also start to get better? Alan Shaw : Sure. I'll comment on that. We've taken a very hard look at our effectiveness in terms of throughput efficiency and our ability to deliver capacity for the market through our terminals. And in many cases, there's a lot of inflation working its way through the entire US economy that manifests itself, of course, at the terminal level as well. But what we are focused on is ensuring, number one, that we have the capability at the terminal level to handle the volumes that TOP SPG is going to deliver for us going forward. We are reconfiguring some of those contracts as we speak to both make sure that we have that capacity for the future as well as ensure that the type of operation that we have is the one that we need. So we're working on that as we speak, and we're confident that as TOP SPG rolls out here, we're going to see it manifest itself as additional capacity for our customers and improved executability for the service we deliver. And the physical capacity of our intermodal footprint has allowed us to handle much higher intermodal volumes just as recently as 2018. Mark George : Absolutely. So the physical capacity is there. We're working on our engagement with our lift contractors with shared service metrics, and we're working on how we can improve our own performance with the trains. And I think that's a recipe for success for our customers. David Vernon : Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question. Bascome Majors : Yeah. Apologies, I was on mute there. So your largest domestic intermodal chatter partner recently renewed this valves with their Western real partner, committed to a really big capital investment going to drive midterm growth and share gain from highway. Can you talk a little bit about what your appetite for that type of commitment and customer visibility it might provide is? Is it Norfolk? And whether a firmed up or expanded channel partner deal would be more and less likely after you get through some of the operating plan changes that you're currently undergoing for intermodal? Thank you. Alan Shaw : Well, there's probably very little I can talk about any of those things. But let me say this, we are blessed with a fantastic portfolio of customers. The customer you're talking about is a very valued partner of ours, including some others. And they are positioning themselves for growth. Our customers want to grow, they are poised to grow. They're investing for growth, and we are, too. And so you put the combination of very powerful intermodal franchise. We would argue the best certainly in the Eastern United States, put that together with a robust portfolio of partners who are delivering value for their customers in the marketplace. And I think it's already a great combination. It can only get stronger. Bascome Majors : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Shaw for any final comments. Alan Shaw : Thank you for your time and your questions, and I appreciate you joining our call this morning. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Luke Nichols, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Nichols. You may now begin. Luke Nichols : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Please note that during today\u2019s call, we will make certain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and may differ materially from actual results. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. Our presentation slides are available at nscorp.com in the Investors section, along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures used today to comparable GAAP measures. A full transcript and download will be posted after the call. Turning to Slide 3. It\u2019s now my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer, Alan Shaw. Alan Shaw : Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Norfolk Southern\u2019s second quarter 2022 earnings call. I am joined today by Cindy Sanborn, Chief Operating Officer; Ed Elkins, Chief Marketing Officer; and Mark George, Chief Financial Officer. In the second quarter, we stabilized service levels, expanded our pipeline of conductor trainees and launched the next evolution of our operating plan, top SPG with our signature no surprises approach. Service is not yet where we want it to be, but I am encouraged by our progress and inspired by the commitment and shared vision of our talented team. I am privileged to spend a lot of time in the field with our hard-working craft employees and operations supervisors. I see firsthand and sincerely appreciate their daily dedication to serving our customers. We are eager to reach an agreement that keeps our people among the highest paid craft workers of any industry and recognizes their essential service to our customers, our company and the U.S. economy. Moving to Slide 4. Thanks to the combined efforts of our team. We delivered solid financial performance in the second quarter with record revenue and earnings per share. Revenue increased 16% as a 20% increase in revenue per unit more than offset a 3% volume decline. Expenses grew by 21% year-over-year due primarily to higher fuel prices. Operating ratio was up 260 basis points versus last year\u2019s quarterly record. Comparisons were adversely impacted by the absence of a large property sale we called out last year as well as fuel price headwinds. Despite these headwinds, EPS improved by 5%, $3.45 per share, a second quarter record. The steps we are taking today to restore service and implement our new top SPG operating plan are making Norfolk Southern a more customer-centric operations-driven organization that will deliver long-term value for our customers and shareholders. Our top SPG operating plan is part of the equation for improving service. We named this iteration, SPG because it creates a platform for consistent service, continuous productivity improvement and smart growth for our customers, Norfolk Southern and our shareholders. There is no doubt we have an enviable value proposition to compete in today\u2019s logistics marketplace and where markets are headed. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, I\u2019ll share a few insights on how we will unlock that value. I\u2019ll now turn the discussion to Cindy for an update on operations and a detailed look at how our company is aligned around restoring service and creating a safe efficient and reliable product that meets our customers\u2019 needs and supports their growth. Cindy? Cindy Sanborn : Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 6. In the second quarter, our team continued to face a challenging operational environment as we work to stabilize service levels, drive productivity gains and increase our T&E workforce. Crew starts were down 3% in the quarter and volumes also down 3% and flat gross ton miles. Similar to what I discussed last quarter, we continue to make gains in crew productivity. However, we would have preferred to run additional crew starts that were limited by staffing challenges. As we promote more of the conductor trainees currently in our pipeline, we will see additional highly productive crew starts that will support more volume and further increases to the record train size we have produced this year. Despite the ongoing decision to keep a portion of our surge locomotive fleet active to promote service recovery, we produced another all-time record for fuel efficiency, driven by our multipronged strategy to reduce consumption. This strategy includes the DC to AC conversion program, data-driven solutions to idle reduction and small but powerful investments in friction modification technology, just to name a few components. We expect to drive even better results as we execute on that strategy and enhance the fluidity of our network. Moving on to Slide 7. Train speed and terminal dwell remained challenged in the quarter, but we are really encouraged by the improvements we\u2019re seeing here in July. We are pulling every lever to restore service levels and delivering for our customers as our top priority. We have a long way to go, and our workforce is dedicated to getting the job done. I\u2019m going to speak over the next few slides about the plan for accomplishing this. Turning to Slide 8, which is an update on our T&E staffing progress. We\u2019re maintaining a very strong pipeline of conductor trainees. And even more encouraging, as you can see that in July, we\u2019re really making progress on getting those employees qualified more than offsetting ongoing attrition. And the impact on our network is being felt. We are continuing to start classes weekly and expect this momentum to continue. I will note that the labor market is still very challenging, particularly in certain locations. We\u2019re taking advantage of every option to get folks where we need them, including go teams, transfers, sign-on and attendance bonuses, retirement deferral and referral incentives and more. We\u2019re also examining how we can adjust our operation to best align resources with demand. An example of this is that our two of our major terminals, Macon and Bellevue, recall that both of these former hump yards were converted to flat switching in 2020. Switching demand has increased in both locations since that time, and we have begun the process of resuming conventional hump operations at both facilities to provide the capacity we need to most expeditiously and efficiently serve our customers with negligible upstart our ongoing costs. Having the ability to return to humping operations as demand dictates is an example of resiliency we now have in our network and a lever we can pull to improve service. We are excited about the talented individuals joining us to help move the economy, and we are confident we will continue to make progress on our staffing priorities. On Slide 9, I am very happy with the progress we\u2019ve made on our safety initiatives and translating that to fewer injuries and train accidents. Especially with large numbers of new employees starting out in the field, this reinforces that all of our employees, tenured and new alike are laser-focused on running a safe operation, providing a critical foundation for the future. Now moving to Slide 10. I\u2019ll talk about the progress we\u2019ve made with rolling out the latest evolution of our operating plan, TOP|SPG. As a reminder, TOP is in an acronym building on the legacy of Thoroughbred Operating Plans. And as Alan noted earlier, SPG signifies the equal prominence of the three pillars : service, productivity and growth. Late in the second quarter, we launched the plan, which was focused on creating more balance and executability within our network. We looked at how our business, rate flows and train composition have changed over the last few years and then couple that with a deep dive on how each of our terminals and routes can best handle the business. We took a fresh approach to balancing the number of crews and locomotives flowing across our core routes. I\u2019ve spoken before about the benefits of distributed power locomotives on longer trains, and as we\u2019re creating longer trains, when we built the plan for when and where we apply distributed power. We looked at prior and prospective train consolidations and weighed what it would take to continue launching and landing longer trains both from a time and resource perspective and made holistic decisions about what is best for service, productivity and growth. As we go forward, we will increase the service frequency in several of our core intermodal markets while simplifying the role of each terminal, particularly where we have more than one terminal in each market. This will allow us to drive even more value from our intermodal franchise and will promote executability and growth. Our bulk strategy has a long-term focus. In recent years, we\u2019ve made solid progress on train consolidations and to a lesser degree, blending with other traffic types. Now we\u2019re putting added emphasis on identifying how we can take the remaining unit train network and add an incremental 10, 20 or 30 cars to each train. Moving to Slide 11, to discuss a couple of metrics that indicate the early progress we\u2019re seeing. First, our arrival train performance has seen substantial improvements here in July. With TOP|SPG, we adjusted 90% of our train schedules to meet the service and executability standards I described on the previous slide, and this improvement is very encouraging. As I showed on the network update, our velocity has been improving in July, and this train performance trend reinforces that velocity is translating into trains hitting their slots at an increasing rate. One of the several reasons for this is the strong increase in the number of distributed powertrains we run each day. Team built a solid plan and is now executing it, and this is a component that will directly impact each aspect of SPG as DP trains run smoother, creating service resiliency. They are also more fuel-efficient than shorter trains driving productivity, and they give us a capacity dividend driving growth. We have a long way to go to fully restoring service. These are just a few examples of where we are and further improvements will continue to be driven by three primary functions : staffing initiatives paying off; the success of top SPG; and a solid execution by our field workforce. Thank you. And I will now turn it over to Ed. Ed Elkins : Thanks, Cindy, and good morning, everybody. Let\u2019s go to Slide 13. Our results for the quarter reflect strong revenue growth amidst still recovering volume from network challenges. We achieved record revenue for the quarter of $3.3 billion. That\u2019s up 16% year-over-year on higher revenue from fuel surcharge and price improvement. Revenue per unit was also a record and revenue per unit, excluding fuel, saw a double-digit increase from the same period last year. This revenue growth more than offset a 3% decline in overall volume, resulting from service disruptions. Within merchandise, overall volume was down slightly as declines in steel and construction-related shipments from strained network fluidity were partially offset by gains in sand, driven by increased drilling activity in response to rising demand for natural gas, also helping to offset those declines with notable growth in our grain shipments due to rising export demand. Merchandise revenue and revenue per unit were records for the quarter on higher revenue from fuel surcharge and price gains. Now turning to Intermodal. Revenue, revenue per unit and revenue per unit excluding fuel were all up double digits in the second quarter with higher fuel surcharge price gains and higher revenue from storage fees more than offsetting the impact of those volume declines. International intermodal shipments were markedly down year-over-year, driven largely by a shift in our customer base away from Inland Point Intermodal or IPI, in response to ongoing supply chain challenges. Declines in international intermodal were partially offset by modest improvement in domestic shipments year-over-year due to sustained consumer demand. Revenue growth was strongest in our coal business unit this quarter with total revenue, revenue per unit and revenue per unit, excluding fuel, all increasing well north of 30% year-over-year in the second quarter. This growth was propelled by price gains, particularly in our export coal markets. Coal volume in the second quarter was negatively impacted by limited supply and facility closures. Overall, our performance for the quarter reflects an improving revenue portfolio that will serve as a platform for long-term sustainable revenue growth into the future. Moving to our outlook on Slide 14. We\u2019re cautiously optimistic that the demand environment will remain strong through the end of 2022, providing opportunities for us to expand our volume and revenue base as fluidity is restored to the network. Despite recession risks amid record inflation and aggressive monetary policy, most economists are still forecasting GDP growth above 1% for both the third and the fourth quarters of 2022. In addition, we are beginning to see gas prices moderate nationally and unemployment remains very low, both of which bode well for consumption, which drives many of our markets. Specific to our merchandise segment, we expect volume strength in the second half to be led by our automotive markets where U.S. light vehicle production is currently forecasted to be up 18% over the production levels experienced in the last six months of 2021. Looking at commodity prices, we see mixed signals for many of our markets, but overall prices remain elevated from those pre-pandemic levels. Manufacturing activity has been a tailwind throughout 2022. However, the outlook is less certain for the remainder of the year. Lastly, we anticipate overall year-over-year improvements in most of our merchandise markets as our service levels recover. Within intermodal, we expect sequential volume improvement in both our domestic and international lines of business in the second half of 2022 as demand remains strong and service improvements will allow for greater throughput on our network. Backlog demand for container movements will provide opportunities for growth in our domestic franchise. In addition, new opportunities for domestic volume growth exists in the truck and logistics market, and we\u2019re laser-focused on driving highway to rail conversions to expand our market share. With respect to our international lines of business, increasing import activity is providing growth opportunities, although lower IPI is a limiting factor. We\u2019re also keeping a close eye on truck pricing as rates have fallen, albeit from historically very high levels. Finally, our outlook for coal is positive for the second half of the year with growth in our utility and export markets driven by energy demand. Recent declines in export met coal prices suggest we\u2019re not likely to realize the same upside potential in RPU that we achieved in the second quarter. Market conditions support year-over-year volume growth in these markets with upside potential driven by coal supply and network fluidity. While we recognize that uncertainty persists in the macroeconomic environment, we continue to see opportunities for volume growth in the markets that we serve. As part of our execution of our top SPG operating plan, we are committed to capturing these opportunities, expanding our business by delivering the quality service that our customers need to thrive. I\u2019ll now turn it over to Mark for an update on our financial results. Mark George : Thank you, Ed. As Alan noted, our EPS grew $0.17 or 5% in the quarter, while the operating ratio contracted 260 basis points. On Slide 16, we reconcile some of the drivers for both of those changes. Recall the $55 million discrete property sale in Q2 of 2021 that impacted our OR by 200 basis points. Also in Q2 last year, there was a state tax law change that impacted EPS by $0.09 and had a 220 basis point favorable impact on last year\u2019s Q2 effective tax rate. This year, we have some outsized impacts and claims related to accrual adjustments, but also an accrual related to a legal case. All totaling $16 million, and that creates a 50 basis point headwind on our operating ratio and a nickel drag on EPS. That leaves a modest 10 basis point increase in core OR that was heavily impacted by 140 basis points of headwind from fuel. Shifting to the overall reported highlights on Slide 17. As Ed discussed, revenues grew 16% despite the 3% volume decline, thanks to strong RPU again this quarter. Operating expenses were up 21%, driven in large part by fuel, operating income was up 9%, but net income was flat due to tax rate compares and non-operating headwinds from company-owned life insurance investments. Despite the flat net income, EPS was up 5% from the lower share count. Drilling into the operating expense components on Slide 18, nearly two-thirds of the increase in operating expense is from higher fuel cost. Increase of material and other of $75 million is affected by the $55 million property gain we called out last year and the $16 million of items that I spoke about earlier. Purchased services and rents are impacted by both inflation and our current service situation. The slower network speed is a critical driver impacting the higher equipment rents, while purchased services captures higher rates for our third-party lift contractors as well as our IT contractors. Compensation and benefits is a tailwind with lower incentive accruals, offsetting the cost of trainees as well as general wage inflation. As you can imagine, the current labor negotiations are likely to play out here in the second half and may result in incremental headwinds to comp the benefits that we are unable to estimate at this time. Shifting to the P&L below operating income on Slide 19, other income is actually an expense in the quarter of $14 million, driven by losses on our company-owned life insurance investment. I know this line item is difficult to estimate and model, so let me provide some clarity to help you at least directionally. This account is a collection of non-operating income and expense items that typically nets to about $15 million of income per quarter. On top of this, we have returns on our company-owned life insurance investments. A portion of this asset, roughly $525 million is invested in a traditional blend of equities and fixed income and we mark-to-market each quarter. These are non-cash gains or losses. And it\u2019s important to note that neither the gains nor losses from these investments are subject to income tax. As such the effective tax rate in this quarter was a bit higher than usual at 24.7%. While net income was exactly flat earnings per share increased 5% due to the accumulation of our share repurchases in the past year. Going back to income tax for a moment, I would also like to highlight that Pennsylvania enacted legislation in July to reduce their state tax rate. And the accounting for that change will have a roughly $135 million one-time non-cash favorable adjustment the income tax expense in the third quarter. Now turning to free cash flow on Slide 20, we\u2019ve generated nearly $1.2 billion in free cash flow through six months with property additions trending higher than last year with strong progress being made on both our rail replacement program and our DC-to-AC locomotive conversion program. Whereas Cindy touched upon, we gain operational benefits as well as improved fuel efficiency. Incremental inflation is also having an impact on property additions so I would expect CapEx to be at the high-end of our $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion guidance range. Shareholder distributions are up and you\u2019ll observe here the 19% higher dividend payments through six months on top of continued strong share repurchase activity. And with that, I\u2019ll hand it back to Alan. Alan Shaw : Thank you, Mark. I\u2019ll conclude with an update on our outlook for the year and brief thoughts on our strategy for long-term value creation. You\u2019ll see, on Slide 21, our confidence in the revenue outlook has improved the 12% plus year-over-year growth underpinning the improved revenue outlook, a strong first half performance, continued strength in fuel surcharge revenues and better sequential volumes associated with service improvement in the back half of 2022. Our first half operating ratio was the result of a delayed service recovery and elevated fuel prices. These headwinds will translate into a deterioration in full-year operating ratio. Although we expect the back half to improve from the first half as our service recovery ramps, allowing us to absorb more and reduce costs associated with our service challenges. As Mark mentioned, we do not know if there will be any incremental costs recorded in 2022 associated with a resolution in our labor negotiations. Turning to Slide 22, although our focus today is on restoring service in the short-term, our vision extends much further. As I complete my first 100 days as CEO, I\u2019d like to share some insights on our future. The work we are doing now to improve service is only the beginning. We\u2019re going to build long-term resiliency into our network, creating sustainable value for our customers. Norfolk Southern has a franchise that is built for growth. Being customer centric and operations driven, propels Norfolk Southern to a service organization that will compete and win on operational excellence, leveraging the strengths of our powerful network to achieve above market growth. Our value proposition starts with the investments we\u2019ve made over decades to build a robust network that faces the fastest growing segments of the U.S. economy. Our markets extend globally through our strong working relationships with ports, all along the east coast, the great lakes and the Gulf of Mexico. We have cultivated more than 250 short-line partnerships, the most of any Class I railroad. Extending the reach of our network even further and creating even more options for our customers. We have longstanding relationships with a desirable portfolio of valued customers, reflecting a diversity as broad as the U.S. economy. Our automotive, metals, agriculture and consumer products markets are enduring strengths. And our unparalleled intermodal franchise will be an increasing driver of long-term growth. Our best-in-class channel partners and industry leading industrial development team position us well to capitalize on the growth of e-Commerce and the acceleration of onshore as we move Norfolk Southern forward. Leveraging the sustainability advantage of our service product will give us another compelling selling point as more shippers prioritize Scope 3 emissions reduction in the years ahead. We\u2019ll keep driving forward with industry leading technologies, enhancing our productivity and efficiency, and creating a best-in-class consumer oriented experience that makes it easier for customers to do business with Norfolk Southern. Consistent, convenient, cost effective service will enable shippers to build their supply chains around the inherent advantages of our network. We will deliver the simplicity of truck with the efficiency of rail. This is how we will achieve our vision of a customer centric, operations driven organization, and compete successfully in the $800 billion plus truck and logistics market. When I talk to my colleagues throughout Norfolk Southern, from our headquarters to our rail yards, I am energized. Our people are passionate about serving our customers and proud of the essential role we play in moving the American economy. Our team is the reason we will be successful. We are building a winning culture with innovation as a core competency, where people confidently bring forward their best ideas, continuously develop their skills and feel valued for their contributions. We look forward to sharing more about our strategy for long-term shareholder value creation in the months ahead. We will now open the call to questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question will be coming from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Jordan Alliger : Yeah. Hi morning. Sort of \u2013 in thinking about your look ahead to sort of the second half and the sequential improvement. Can you maybe discuss in your mind what the most critical factor is to getting that service up and in turn volumes, is it adding more heads? Is it the new TOP SPG plan, simply easier comps, maybe just give some color around the critical factors as you would rank them? Thanks. Alan Shaw : Hey, good morning, Jordan. The critical factors are already in play. We\u2019ve ramped up our headcount and we continue to have a very robust pipeline of conductor trainees. We\u2019ve got close to 900 as of this morning, and we\u2019ve implemented a new operating plan, which is already providing some benefit for us and our customers in terms of improved fluidity and service to our customers. And so as we continue to add headcount, implement our plan we are very confident about the ability to improve service, which will allow us to accept more volume and enhance our productivity, driving OR gains. Jordan Alliger : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Brian Ossenbeck : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just to follow up on the service, we\u2019ve seen the improvements in first final mile trip line compliance, but they\u2019re coming off of really low levels. Is that improvement, that rate changed, is that enough to really see substantial volume recovery? Or do you think you need to hit a certain level to start to bring volume back sustainably onto the network? And then just a quick clarification for Mark, can you talk about gain on sale on the quarter, looks like it was about $31 million, wanted to see if that was right and what your expectations are for the rest of the year? Alan Shaw : Cindy, would you talk about what you\u2019re seeing with service please? Cindy Sanborn : Yeah, so great question Brian, and specifically to our measure around first mile/last mile, it\u2019s a very rigorous measure and we put that in place very specifically to make sure that we were understanding what the customer was feeling and we\u2019ve had it in place for a while now, probably two years. And we look back to see where service was at a \u2013 we had a really good level in 2019 and so that\u2019s what we\u2019re aiming towards. And while the number on the page is, percentage wise challenging it\u2019s a measure that we hold ourselves to real high accountability with. And I think Ed can talk a little bit about how the customer feels and how they see the measure. Ed Elkins : Sure. And thank you, Cindy. The first thing I would say is, our customers helped us develop our metrics and our targets here. Our customers want to do more business with us and they\u2019re starting to see some early green shoots here in terms of service improvement and we fully expect that to continue throughout the year. Alan Shaw : Brian, can I just clarify for you the gains. We got about weak last year you may recall we had $67 million of gains. We kind of called out $55 million as a more anomalous figure. And this year right now in Q2, we had $28 million of gains. Mark George : Brian I\u2019ll add, in addition to first mile/last mile, we\u2019re also delivering improvements in train speed and terminal dwell as well. Brian Ossenbeck : And Mark for the rest of the year, what should we pencil in for a normalized level of gain, if you have one? Mark George : Yeah. I\u2019m not going to really give you much more than the normal usual quarterly cadence. It can be a little bit volatile and real estate gains obviously can move around, even if we expect them to happen this year, they can certainly slide. So if you look so far year-to-date, we\u2019re running at about in the low $30 million range, there might be similar amount in the back half, but probably less than that, because things are moving around a little bit on us. Brian Ossenbeck : Right, makes sense. Okay. Thank you for the details. Appreciate it. Mark George : All right, Brian. Thanks. Operator : The next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please proceed with your questions. Chris Wetherbee : Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. Wanted to talk a little bit about the operating ratio outlook and understand if there\u2019s a volume assumption underlying that. Can you give us a sense of sort of what you need there in terms of operating leverage to be able to hit the numbers? And then I guess Mark, you\u2019ve given us some clarity in sort of OpEx going forward quarter-by-quarter, should we assume somewhere in the $1.9 billion is the right number sort of ex-fuel going forward still or any help around that for the back half in terms of the operating ratio and volumes would be great? Alan Shaw : Chris, with respect to our outlook for volume, we have said we\u2019ll be flat for the year. We\u2019re down 4% year-to-date. So that suggests some sequential improvement as we move into the second half of the year and that\u2019s going to be supported by our improving service product. Mark, you want to comment on OpEx? Mark George : Yeah. Chris, you\u2019re exactly right in your thinking. If you look at our Q2 OpEx numbers and take-away fuel, because fuel\u2019s going to be \u2013 what fuel\u2019s going to be as that moves, but you look at OpEx ex-fuel in the second quarter and even maybe excluding the items that I called out the $16 million that was somewhat anomalous. We would project that amount would be representative of what to expect in the last two quarters on average. So there could be some moves within any particular account or line item in the P&L, but in aggregate that\u2019s kind of the area that we\u2019re expecting. And if we have unexpected events, we\u2019ll call them out to you, like we typically do in our quarterly calls. Alan Shaw : And then with respect to the cadence of OR improvement, Mark also highlighted his comments, the 140 basis point headwind that fuel had in the first half of the year. We do not expect that to be the case in the second half of the year. Mark George : We expect it to moderate, yes as we go through the balance of the year. Chris Wetherbee : Okay, great. Thanks very much for the time. Appreciate it. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Jason Seidl : Thanks. Operator wanted to talk a little bit about the call RPU. I think you guys mentioned you\u2019re expecting it to step down here. I just wanted to get a little more meat on the bone. Is that just a sequential step down or do you think it could step down on a year-over-year basis as well? Alan Shaw : Ed, would you please address that? Ed Elkins : Sure. We stay very close to our customers and of course we\u2019re looking at these commodity prices every day. And the export prices have changed quite a bit. The fact is we \u2013 they\u2019re still historically high and there\u2019s still a lot of energy in the market, so to speak. But the [indiscernible] have dropped off as a result of the rise in coal inventory ahead of sanctions on Russia, but they remain near three year highs. So when you think about production limitations, you think about constraint, supply chains, and really what looks like steady demand, it should continue to support higher prices as for both thermal and met coals. We expect to see contract and spot pricing outpace where we thought we were at the beginning of the year, but we don\u2019t expect to be in those same inflated atmosphere that we saw toward the end of Q1. So when I think about it, I do see sequential declines in the yield. That\u2019s about as far as I want to go. Jason Seidl : Okay. So it sounds like notable sequential declines, but at least for now, probably still above prior year. Alan Shaw : Yes. Jason Seidl : Okay. Thank you for the time as always. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott Group : Hey, thanks. Good morning. I guess a couple of things, how much more headcount do you realistically expect to add in the second half, maybe Cindy, any thoughts on restarting some of these hump yards and if that\u2019s \u2013 if there\u2019s more of them to do, if that\u2019s permanent? And then Ed, I just want to follow your point about, was that coal RPU is going to be down sequentially or is that overall RPU that you think will be down sequentially from 2Q to 3Q? Thank you. Alan Shaw : Yeah, Scott I\u2019ll tackle the headcount question and just say that, I expect that we\u2019ll be probably about a thousand heads higher at the end of the year, compared to the end of last year. And the preponderance of that is going to be in T&E, first with trainees, higher trainee counts, but then also qualified T&E employees as well. And you can see our targets that we gave to the STB. Our target is 7,330, I think by November. And that continues to ramp up on the qualified ranks as we get into next year. I think we\u2019ve got to target out there of over 7,500, by the time we get to May. Let me hand it off to Cindy, you want to talk about humps? Cindy Sanborn : Sure. Yeah. Thanks for the question, Scott, because I want to make sure I put that in my prepared remarks so I could talk a little bit more about it. We reactivated these humps to give ourselves some additional capacity that we need in the two areas served by Macon and Bellevue. The way switching demand has evolved since 2020, there\u2019s enough critical mass to justify returning them to service as hump yards and because we idled them which was our plan always in 2020, and we didn\u2019t eliminate their capabilities. We do not expect any upfront or ongoing cost of any substantial nature. So we think that returning to hump yards is, humping cars even for either short or long term as an example of resiliency. And it\u2019s important that we have that. And I do think, when you think about it, the productivity gains that we generated when we idled them the first time, we\u2019re going to be able to hold onto most of those. That was a lot of the thinking that went into \u2013 that was part of the thinking that went into returning them to service. And I do think, we\u2019ll always evaluate and there\u2019ll be times where we may see that we\u2019ll idle them again. So it\u2019s meant to help us do our number one goal here, which is to return our service levels. Ed Elkins : Yeah. Let me talk about coal for a second. Yeah, we\u2019re going to see sequential improve \u2013 sequential decline in the coal RPU, that\u2019s going to be an inevitable drag on the overall RPU for the rest of the year, but we continue to see strong price opportunities in our other markets, including merchandise intermodal auto. Scott Group : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Ben Nolan with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Ben Nolan : Yeah, I appreciate it. So you guys mentioned storage fees on the intermodal side. I\u2019m curious if you could maybe put a little context around that and then how you see that playing out in the back half of the year? Ed Elkins : Sure. I\u2019ll take that. We had anticipated that supply chains would be improving as the year has progress. And while we saw some improvement earlier in the year, we\u2019ve seen more of the constraints really become more acute lately. So we are anticipating that supply chains will improve throughout the rest of the year. And as they do and fluidity improves, then we\u2019ll see those storage charges decline. Ben Nolan : Okay. Any context and as to how we should think about what that means in terms of order magnitude at all? Ed Elkins : Now, I think we we\u2019ll see presuming and this is forecast in the future for things I don\u2019t control like supply chains, but if you see improvement, you\u2019ll see similar change in the rate of storage. Ben Nolan : All right. I appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes to the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Justin Long : Thanks. Maybe to start with one for Mark, just thinking about the full year OR guidance, it\u2019s a 100 to 200 basis points worse than what you anticipated coming into the year. How much of that is fuel versus everything else? And then Cindy, I was wondering if you could talk about what you\u2019re seeing with attrition rates right now versus normalized levels, especially attrition rates for new employees that you\u2019ve hired in the last year? Mark George : Justin thanks. This is Mark. Certainly a portion of it is fuel for sure, but I think the real issue here is just the volume has not come the way we expected it to come. When we were talking about middle of the quarter there about still having a path to our prior guidance, it was really going to require that we saw an upward inflection on volumes take hold pretty quickly and lead to some sustainable ramp that obviously did not happen as we concluded Q2. And we\u2019re now projecting more of a gradual ramp in volumes, as we\u2019re seeing service start to improve here. And then yes, fuel that you heard its 140 basis points headwind. Now in the second quarter, it\u2019s bigger than we had expected. We do think it moderates as we go through the back half of the year. We\u2019re not \u2013 we can\u2019t control that, we\u2019re not sure. We do take into account the fuel curves, when we look at our projections for fuel but certainly fuel is an element of that change as well. Cindy Sanborn : And Justin, as far as attrition rates, look globally we\u2019re seeing about the same as we\u2019ve seen all year, both from a tenured employee perspective and a new employee perspective or a conductor trainee perspective. There are clearly markets and locations where it\u2019s more challenging than others. And that\u2019s also consistent with where we\u2019ve been all year. I will say that we just recently announced that we are increasing our conductor training rates. And we think that\u2019ll have a very positive impact for us, both in retention as well as attraction. So we\u2019re feeling good. Justin Long : Okay. Thanks for the time. Alan Shaw : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Jon Chappell : Thank you. Good morning. Cindy, there\u2019s been this acute focus on labor, and it seems like you guys are doing a good job of ramping up pretty quickly, especially in July, and you\u2019re starting to see it in your service metrics. Norfolk specifically has had a little bit more issue with chassis over the last 12 months as well, and you guys kind of laid that out in the presentation. If we take the labor component out of it, what\u2019s the equipment situation like and what\u2019s your latent capacity that if you\u2019re appropriately resourced from a T&E perspective, you can actually meet this demand and we\u2019ll see more of an inflection in volumes. Cindy Sanborn : So let me just add equipment wise. We do \u2013 we are \u2013 I\u2019ll talk about locomotives and I\u2019ll turn it over to Ed to talk a little bit about chassis. You didn\u2019t mention locomotives, but it is important to make sure you note that in my prepared remarks, I did indicate that we\u2019re keeping our surge fleet fully activated throughout this whole process here as we recover service, and we\u2019re bringing on our DC to AC conversions, which is also allowing us some capacity from an equipment basis on locomotives from a chassis perspective, let me turn it over to Ed for some detail. Ed Elkins : Sure. Thank you, Cindy. We have a couple of hundred in hand with more arriving each week, and we expect a significant tranche of improvement to land during the fourth quarter this year. So I think we\u2019re in pretty good shape when it comes to our chassis. We see the normal, what I would call normal course of business sporadic disruptions associated with chassis for both other domestic partners as well as steamship lines. But again, I would consider that normal course of business. Outside the gate, we are seeing supply chains impacted by the congestions of first mile last mile on the street, elevated street wells as well as volume fluctuations associated with different ports, a lot of drayage capacity issues and, of course, available warehouse space. And if you read the papers the way I do, you see a lot of ships waiting offshore at a number of ports, which has really not shrunk very much. Jon Chappell : Yes. Got it. Okay. Thank you, Ed. Thanks, Cindy. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Ken Hoexter : Hey, great. Good morning. Maybe, Cindy, I just want to dig into the hump returning a little bit here. Just why bring them back, isn\u2019t it more efficient to be flat, I guess, just from us being on the other side of the table years and years, it seems like all we heard was the first thing under precision scheduled railroading to do was to eliminate the humps to save on touching and time. And then, I guess, Alan, with that, would you consider bringing on any PSR expertise just as CN just did with Ed Harris on a consulting basis. Obviously, there\u2019s a couple of x, I guess, PSR experts out there that are available. Is that something you would consider? Cindy Sanborn : So Ken, let me start with the hump. So we really did take a really deep dive into this. And when you think about not only sort of traffic changes that have occurred since 2020, that had a big impact on it. But the other piece is, the idea of switching cars beyond the hump yards and bypassing them reflect which to reduce demand so that you can flap switching them. Challenge has really been having the people to do that switching where we are moving them to serving our customers. So the value is really in being able to have a location that you can get to switching done it may be short term and maybe longer term, we\u2019ll just see how it evolves, but that\u2019s the thinking behind it. And again, I do want to emphasize that we really consider the cost associated with it to make sure that we had a really good trade-off here. And we\u2019re really going to be able to hold on a number of the games that we have. Alan Shaw : We\u2019re confident it\u2019s not going to add cost, more of the case to the humps is making sure that you\u2019re not running cars out of route just to have them hump. And so we saw that discipline when we closed these two hump yards during the pandemic and the volume outlook has changed. We\u2019ve maintained our focus on a very efficient, balanced operating plan. We just installed a new operating plan and opening the humps just makes those switching operations more efficient. And we\u2019ve got a great team. As you take a \u2013 just look around the table of the folks on this call, we\u2019re fortunate to have two folks who join us from outside of Norfolk Southern who contributed greatly to our success. Ken Hoexter : Thanks, Alan. Thanks, Cindy. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Tom Wadewitz : Great. Yes. Thank you. I wanted to ask a little bit more on TOP|SPG and the schedule changes. I think, Cindy, you said something like 90% of the trains you reviewed and \u2013 how should we think about the schedule changes that were made? And then also maybe if you consider that relative to the changes made a couple of years ago when you originally implemented TOP? I think of those changes as being fewer train starts, longer trains. How should we think about the train schedule changes made with TOP|SPG? Is it also fewer train starts or it sounds like in intermodal might even be more train starts and some different approach. I just wondered if you could offer more perspective on what you\u2019re doing with that in terms of train starts and other changes. Thank you. Cindy Sanborn : Sure. Thanks for the question. So just to go to a high level here, our main three objectives on TOP|SPG were to balance the network, improve executability and increased train size. And part of the changes in the schedules were really to help us balance the network, balance the flows across the network, both cars and locomotives and make sure that we have realistic schedules that allowed trains to arrive and depart terminals. So we didn\u2019t have them bunched in or bunched out of a particular terminal. We also, as I noted in my prepared remarks, have increased our distributed power utilization and accounting for that as trains were departing and/or working in individual terminals is a lot of the work that we\u2019ve done. And the 90% of the schedules doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019ve changed them dramatically, but we\u2019ve adjusted them so that we can make sure that when we operate our plan, that we don\u2019t have conflicts that prevent us from being able to execute consistently. So that\u2019s really what we were trying to achieve there. Alan Shaw : It has substantially reduced the number of train meets on our network, which makes our operations more fluid and more executable by our team. And consistent with our no surprises approach, we involved our customers. Ed, do you want to give some perspective on the customer involvement? Ed Elkins : Sure. Absolutely. The first thing our customers want. And by the way, let me just say, we are so lucky to have a great coalition of partners that we do business with every day, and they really want us to have an executable train schedule. They want to have a predictable service product. And so they have been highly collaborative with us as we\u2019ve gone through the TOP|SPG process. To look at the changes that were necessary to improve the executability of our product. And I can\u2019t say enough about the collaboration that we\u2019ve had with them. And I think we\u2019re starting to see some early results. And I think that they would say the same thing. So we\u2019re encouraged by those results, but I am most particularly encouraged by the level of the collaboration that we\u2019ve enjoyed with our partners. Tom Wadewitz : So just, I guess, to be clear, should we think of this as a reduction in train starts or an increase or kind of net, not a big impact, but just more rebalancing? Cindy Sanborn : I think as we continue to roll it out, I mean we \u2013 I noted that we started in the second half or actually it was in late second quarter. We still have some work to do to roll it out in the intermodal space. And what you\u2019ll \u2013 what I would say relative to crew starts is we\u2019re going to improve service frequency in some of our core markets, and we\u2019re not going to be adding new starts. And we may have a small reduction in that lane or in those lanes. But it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re still in the process of putting it on the railroad. Alan Shaw : Tom, what it does is it really improves the executability of our operating plan, which means we\u2019re going to be more consistent, more reliable, more on schedule. Those are the principles of PSR. That will reduce the friction costs associated with slowness in our network. Tom Wadewitz : Okay. Great. Thanks for the time. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Amit Mehrotra : Thanks. Hi, everyone. Appreciate the time. Hey, Mark. I just wanted to understand the cadence of the OR in the back half because volume out of the gate here in the third quarter is pretty weak? I think it\u2019s down like 3% or something like that. Typically, we do see maybe flattish to slightly worse OR 3Q versus 2Q. I don\u2019t know if \u2013 I mean is the full year guide, the revised full year guide really contemplating kind of a big inflection in the fourth quarter or does the third quarter look a lot like the fourth quarter? If you can talk about that. And then just for the industry, maybe this one is for Cindy and Alan. The industry has been talking about better service and more labor for a long time over the last several months. And we\u2019ve been kind of disappointed not just with Norfolk, but I think the industry as a whole, I think it would just be helpful to understand when do you guys actually think timing-wise, we see a more pronounced inflection. We\u2019ve seen some green shoots, as you mentioned, or maybe a stabilization. I Mean, are we talking about September, October? When do you think you\u2019re at the point equipment and labor wise where we actually see some tangible inflection in the service metrics? Alan Shaw : Yes. I\u2019ll cover the service metrics first. We outlined our plan for the Service Transportation Board. It will be beginning of next year before we\u2019re at our targeted headcount that\u2019s going to create a big lift. We\u2019ve already seen improvements in our service product with the implementation of TOP|SPG and with the onboarding of new conductors. And I think that will continue to improve as the year progresses. It won\u2019t be linear, but we should see some lift as we move out of vacation season as well in terms of the availability of our crews. Mark George : And Amit, so that leads to pretty much the volume profile as well. We\u2019ll probably see more of a ramp into fourth quarter with more volume that should help the operating ratio. But of course, there are seasonal headwinds that typically take effect in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter that might neutralize some of that when we look at the OR progression. So we\u2019re not going to give the quarterly guidance, but it does seem to be probably a little bit more of an upward \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, a little bit more of a gradual improvement in the OR as we go through the balance of the year as volumes come on mainly in the fourth quarter. The volume growth, I should say, comes on mainly in the fourth quarter. Amit Mehrotra : So does that mean we take a step back before we accelerate into the fourth quarter? I\u2019m just trying to understand, is it a slope upwards in the back half versus where you are in the second quarter or is it a step back is it a little bit of a J curve? Mark George : Well, I think we\u2019re going to \u2013 I would fully expect that we\u2019ll see sequential improvement from the second to the third quarter. I\u2019m just \u2013 I\u2019m not going to tell you yet whether we\u2019ll also see sequential improvement from the third quarter or to the fourth quarter or if there\u2019ll be somewhat on par with one another. Amit Mehrotra : Got it. Okay. That\u2019s very clear. Thank you very much, everybody. Appreciate it. Mark George : Thank you, Amit. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Ari Rosa with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Ari Rosa : Yes. Hi, good morning. So I wanted to ask just kind of a broader philosophical question. I think we\u2019ve been dancing around it with a couple of questions that have been asked. But you\u2019re talking about obviously adding headcount, bringing equipment back onto the network, reintroducing some of these hump yards. Is there a point where service improvement maybe is at odds with OR improvement? And at what point do you think we can kind of see a resumption in OR improvement? And as we think about 2023 what kind of incremental margins might we be looking at as that service gets back to where you want it to be? Alan Shaw : Ari, we fully believe that service and margin improvement are complementary. They support each other and our trajectory for service improvements and the attendant improvement in OR belies that fact. We\u2019re going to take a balanced approach. We\u2019ve got balanced objectives of service, productivity and growth and our new operating plan, that provides some sort of insight as to how we\u2019re thinking about this thing. Our priority is to improve service as service and fluidity improve, you\u2019re going to see significant volume uptick and productivity gains, which will collectively drive margin improvement. Mark George : And Ari, I also remind you, in a difficult service environment like we\u2019re dealing with, there\u2019s a fair amount of incremental costs that we\u2019re absorbing to have to cope with it, whether it\u2019s incremental overtime, whether it\u2019s recrews, whether it\u2019s train costs, you name it, training, travel, taxi, there\u2019s a fair amount of cost right now that we\u2019re absorbing in our P&L to deal with the current service challenges. So that starts to lessen as service improves, and I think you need to keep that in mind. Cindy Sanborn : Yes. And even in my prepared remarks, I talked about the fact that both train length and train weight are up even in difficult circumstances here. So think we\u2019ll hold on to that. And I\u2019m very positive on being able to run a very efficient network that serves our customers extremely well. Ari Rosa : Got it. Okay. Thank you for that color. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Brandon Oglenski : Hey, good morning, everyone. And thanks for taking my question. Cindy this might kind of little naive, but I know we always focus on conductor trainees. My understanding, though, is that for engineering or to be an engineer that trains a little bit more intensive or maybe longer duration. So can you talk about your qualified engineer ranks? And is that potentially a next bottleneck or again, is that just a naive question? Cindy Sanborn : It\u2019s a great question. We are \u2013 as you noted, conductors take promotion to engineers. That is our pipeline for locomotive engineers. Over the years, our investments part of the resiliency investments we\u2019ve made is to qualify more people to be locomotive engineers as conductors step them up to qualify and then step them back down to acting and active working conductors. So we keep a buffer that is \u2013 that we\u2019ve used through this time where we can step up engineers and then backfill with conductor trainees. And I would say that we\u2019re already starting the process, training some locomotive engineers will be next month. We will keep an eye on that and maintain that buffer that\u2019s going to be part of \u2013 as we stabilize service levels and get our conductor ranks where they need to be, that will be one of the big areas that we focus on in 2023. Brandon Oglenski : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Ravi Shanker : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Cindy or Alan, can you help us understand how your customers right now are thinking about truck to rail conversion. Obviously, your service is improving, you\u2019re pretty in place TOP|SPG and that helps at the same time the truck market is loosening. And I think for now at least, shippers want like super tight fast supply chains with high turnover. So what\u2019s driving that incremental conversion and is TOP|SPG enough to do that? Alan Shaw : Mark, why don\u2019t you talk about what you\u2019re hearing from our customers with respect to opportunities? Mark George : Absolutely. We\u2019re talking to our partners every day. And frankly, the truck prices are loosening, but our customers remind us every single day that those are from historically very high levels. And the contract rates have stabilized. There are a number of things that our customers want, but one of them is they want to do more business with us. Our customers have freight that they would like to put on the railroad and as our network throughput capacity improves through network velocity, they\u2019re going to do that. They have \u2013 we have line of sight on freight that want to move on the railroad right now, whether it\u2019s in our industrial markets, our consumer markets or energy markets. And we\u2019re confident that as the network velocity improves, our customers are going to find additional value in the product that we\u2019re able to deliver to them, and that will manifest itself in additional volumes later this year. Ravi Shanker : Got it. So given the incremental value provision of rails, you guys are confident that you can push yields higher even if the truck market \u2013 truck pricing comes down? Ed Elkins : Yes. We stay very, very close to that. We\u2019re always looking at what truck prices are doing. Again, contract prices have stabilized at very high levels. We\u2019re always looking at the gap between what we believe the value that we\u2019re offering versus what a truck offers. And we looked at a number of lanes specifically where we offer intermodal service as an example, and we\u2019re comfortable that our door-to-door pricing is very competitive against over-the-road trucking. And let me remind everyone, including myself, there are multiple advantages to using rail versus the highway, including sustainability. We\u2019ve seen a lot of our customers make commitments publicly about what it\u2019s going to take for them to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. And when we think about the consumer packaged goods business, approximately 80% of the greenhouse gas comes from transportation. The efficiency advantage that we deliver for our customers over a long period of time is going to help them achieve those goals. Ravi Shanker : Very good. Thank you. Alan Shaw : I\u2019ll add. We had \u2013 in our intermodal franchise has delivered 22 consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth in RPU ex fuel. That\u2019s during a freight recession and during the pandemic. And so there\u2019s great value with the product that we deliver. Our focus now is on enhancing the value of that product. Ravi Shanker : Makes sense. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question. Bascome Majors : Mark and Alan, as you both alluded to in your prepared remarks, there\u2019s some uncertainty as to what the actual union wage increases from 2024 are ultimately going to be? Can you talk about how you have managed that uncertainty with your accruals so far? And if the actual wage is come in different than those expectations, when do you true that up retroactively and communicate it to us on a go-forward basis? Mark George : Hey Bascome, thanks a lot for the question. This is Mark. Look, we\u2019ve agreed with PEB that we weren\u2019t going to discuss publicly what our relative positions are. But I will tell you, we have accrued a level of back wages that reflects our efforts to keep our craft workers amongst the highest paid in any industry. And obviously, if there\u2019s a settlement that is at a different level, whether that happens through the PEB or subsequent to the PEB, we will have to make an adjustment, and we will make that very, very clear in terms of disclosure to you all what the impact will be. So again, whatever that increment is, we\u2019ll let you know. But right now, we are accruing something based upon what our expectations were. Bascome Majors : Thank you for that. And just to clarify, you mentioned the PEB a couple of times in your timing. Is it the PEB report that would be that triggering your mind or something subsequent like a tentative agreement with the coalition or something in that vein? Mark George : Yes. We have to work with the accountants to understand what the trigger event will be. So I\u2019m not really at liberty to pinpoint that right now on this call. Bascome Majors : Thank you for the time. Mark George : Thank you, Bascome. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Kauffman : Thank you very much, and thank you for taking my question. Just a question about the hiring process. I know there\u2019s been a bunch of this quarter. One of the complaints we had heard from some other rails is that they were seeing a problem retaining employees post training. Now you had mentioned the wage increase and some of the carrots that you had put out there. But I guess two questions. Why has this become so problematic? Is it just that it\u2019s kind of a Gen Z employee wants different things, and we\u2019ve got to change the job kind of item? Is it more of a pay item? And then secondly, let\u2019s say the economy slows a lot faster than we all think, just theoretically, and I know your volume forecast doesn\u2019t imply that. Do we still stay to the 1,000 employees by the end of the year? Cindy Sanborn : Great. Well, let me start with the training retention piece. One of the challenges for our trainees when they do mark up as a seniority-based system they will tend to get the work that others do not necessarily \u2013 they do not want. Those will be the jobs that they can hold. So as they step into that role, some find that, that\u2019s not really what they\u2019re looking for. We \u2013 our training process allows us to convey that information, but sometimes it doesn\u2019t become real until you come up and you mark up. I will say in terms of what could be a solution at the national table is conductor redeployment that will allow us to have a more structured work environment for more conductors than we do today. So that is part of what we feel like is a good solution, and we feel like it will fit the needs and demands of our workforce in the future, which is why we\u2019ve got it on the table for negotiation. Jeff Kauffman : Thank you, Cindy. Mark George : It\u2019s really more of a lifestyle \u2013 Jeff, it\u2019s really more of a lifestyle challenge in a very unique market where everybody is looking for talent. So you have to compete against everybody simultaneously. So labor has their choice of what they want to do. And in many cases, despite the very rich and attractive pay structure that the railroads offer, sometimes, they\u2019d rather work in a more predictable schedule in warehousing or in home construction, where they can be nearby where they live and not stay in hotels and also just not be on call or work their shift. So we\u2019re just in a very unique environment right now where the entire labor market have their options to choose from. Alan Shaw : As Cindy noted, some of those work rules changes that we\u2019re proposing would directly address some of those issues that Mark articulated. Jeff Kauffman : Okay. And second half of the question, I know the trainees are already in process. So were we pretty committed to that 1,000-plus employees by year-end with the STB plan or what if the world changes? Alan Shaw : We are committed to high levels of service throughout all economic cycles because we believe that services resiliency enhances the ability to be opportunistic during the near-term recovery and generates confidence by our customers and building supply chains around us for the long-term. As Ed noted, there are a lot of inherent advantages to our network. There\u2019s a lot of reasons that customers want to do business with us over the long-term. Jeff Kauffman : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our final question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. David Vernon : Hi, good morning, guys. Thanks for fitting me in here at the end. I\u2019ve got two longer-term questions for you on TOP|SPG. If we\u2019re adding 1,000 heads to workforce, can you talk about maybe, Cindy, what level of volume growth you could absorb with that headcount once it gets productive. I\u2019m trying to understand whether the embedded labor productivity level in this new version of the operating plan is higher or lower than maybe what we\u2019ve seen in the early days of PSR? And then, Alan, maybe longer-term on the service side, does this get us to that low to mid-80s in first and last mile sort of service levels as you outlined for the STB? Or is there upside to that? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense for kind of how you think about is low to mid-80s enough to drive modal conversion longer-term? Cindy Sanborn : David, I\u2019ll start. I mean so from TOP|SPG, I mean, I would think it\u2019s going to be a very productive operating plan. And obviously, it\u2019s not going to be static. We\u2019re going to adjust as volume adjusts and as business adjusts across \u2013 going across our network. It\u2019s about balanced executability and train size, as I described. One of the areas that I mentioned in my prepared remarks in the bulk network, we have seen a lot of improvement in train size from the standpoint of combinations of trains, but we will be able to add additional cars to trains as well in our standard sets in our grain network. So I see this as an enabler from a productivity standpoint and allow us to bring on volume with a consistent operation that we will offer. Alan Shaw : Ed, go ahead. Ed Elkins : Let me just add to the fact that the number of people we\u2019re adding, it requires a lot more energy and people to get the network sped up to where it needs to be. And then also that the number of people we\u2019re adding. And once we\u2019re up to speed, gives us the capacity, additional head count capacity to handle even greater volume. So I think that\u2019s the other point is the capacity dividend that a faster network provides will allow us to take on more volume. Mark George : And a stable, reliable, predictable service product over a long period of time is exactly what our customers need to build their businesses around ours, and we can offer tremendous value and unlock value for them and for their customers by delivering that kind of service. That\u2019s what we\u2019re committed to over the long-term, delivering a high level of service that our customers need that allows them to deliver growth and value for their customers. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back to Mr. Alan Shaw for closing comments. Alan Shaw : We thank you for joining us today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

It's now my pleasure to introduce Luke Nichols, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Nichols. You may now begin. Luke Nichols : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Please note that during today's call, we will make certain forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties and may differ materially from actual results. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full disclosure of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. Our presentation slides are available at nscorp.com in the Investors section, along with our reconciliation of any non-GAAP measures used today to the comparable GAAP measures. A full transcript and download will be posted after the call. Turning to Slide 3, it's now my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's President and Chief Executive Officer, Alan Shaw. Alan Shaw : Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Norfolk Southern's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. I'm joined today by Cindy Sanborn, Chief Operating Officer; Ed Elkins, Chief Marketing Officer; and Mark George, Chief Financial Officer. The Norfolk Southern team delivered strong financial results in the third quarter, achieving quarterly records for revenue, net income and earnings per share. We also demonstrated our focus on productivity and efficiency with significant OR improvement, as Mark will describe in a moment. Thank you to all the men and women of Norfolk Southern for their remarkable work this quarter and throughout the year, proudly serving our customers and improving the quality of our product. We are qualifying conductors at a robust pace, executing and refining our TOP|SPG operating plan and further strengthening our leadership team and operations. The impact is evident across our network. We see improved operating metrics, such as higher train speeds and shorter dwells. We see improved customer-facing service metrics. We hear improve feedback from customers who are talking to us about adding business. Volume is the lagging indicator, and we are confident our broad and continuing service improvement will drive growth opportunities in the months ahead. Today, the NS team is providing better service, creating network capacity for growth and demonstrating the customer-centric operations-driven approach. That is the foundation of our success. During the quarter, we reached tentative agreements with the unions that represent our craft colleagues. This was a critical first step. The tentative agreements recognize the significant contributions of our people and keep them among the highest paid craft workers in any industry. In my continuing field visits with frontline railroaders and local supervisors, I've been able to express my appreciation for the vital work they do for Norfolk Southern, our customers and the U.S. economy. Working on the railroad has always been a great opportunity to build a fulfilling career, and we want to keep it that way. In the final days of the cooling off period is the possibility of service disruption . We took a transparent no-surprises approach to communicating with our customers, which help them make informed decisions about how to keep their goods and materials moving. This is an excellent illustration of what it means to be customer-centric. Even though it created a modest headwind on volume, as Ed will describe, we received positive feedback from many of our customers. We'll take that same no surprises approach every time, because it's how we will deepen customer trust and enhance long-term value creation and growth. Now, I'll turn the discussion to Cindy for additional detail on our strong operating progress during the quarter. Cindy? Cynthia Sanborn : Good morning. Turning to Slide 5, our resolve to improve service levels is paying off. During the quarter, we executed a smooth rollout of the latest evolution of our PSR-based operating plan, TOP|SPG, and ended the quarter with network velocity more than 20% improved from where it was entering the quarter. As a result, the service recovery glide path we charted earlier this year for the STB is trending well ahead of schedule. We have more improvements to make with progress being fueled by staffing initiatives, TOP|SPG and disciplined field execution. We are gaining momentum and will continue to drive to enhance our customer service and create capacity. Slide 6 highlights where we are with staffing levels of our transportation workforce. Our pipeline of trainees remains robust, and we have reached the waypoint target of approximately 7,300 qualified T&E staff a month ahead of schedule. This was accomplished through our innovative approach to recruiting and reinforces the advantage we have to recruit a high-quality craft workforce that takes pride in moving the economy forward. As you heard from Alan, we are pleased to have reached tentative agreements in the quarter to keep that workforce among the highest paid in the nation. Slide 7 continues the discussion on service improvements we are making. Last quarter, we shared with you the decision to adjust a couple of our existing major terminals from flat switching to humping. Those shifts went smoothly and are paying dividends today. We are leveraging a similar number of crew starts as we had entering this year inside our yards and terminals and are now moving cars more fluidly through those facilities. As a result, the railcar fleet is moving faster through our terminals. We're operating at high levels of productivity and creating capacity within our switching resources to drive further growth and productivity. As I said last quarter, we will remain flexible to most optimally manage assets, control costs, serve our customers and do so safely. Moving to Slide 8. GTMs were flat year-over-year, coupled with crew starts that were up 1%, produced flat train length and weight. We are very focused on the implementation of TOP|SPG in the quarter and are now poised for growth on our train network. Active Locomotives were up for the fourth consecutive quarter in support of service recovery. And I am pleased to say that as we regain fluidity over the last couple of months, Active Locomotives are trending down on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. The skill of our mechanical workforce, coupled with our DC to AC modernization strategy, allowed us to deploy search fleet capacities to support service recovery at historic levels of reliability. As I've discussed, we're continuing the modernization program in support of reliability and capacity in the future. Lastly, this marked our fourth consecutive quarter of fuel efficiency gains, again, due in part to our fleet investments along with shutdown compliance initiatives, augmented with enhanced communications technology and many more efforts. Slide 9 hits on a pillar of our digital strategy, Empower the Workforce, which crosses our entire operations group. Through Empower the Workforce, we provide mobile, self-service capabilities to our field forces and enable them to better manage their work with modern mobile applications. They are no longer tied to fixed base reporting and can input and retrieve information when they need it in modern, user-friendly mobile applications. We have a mobility group of technology specialists that are responsible for providing consistent, consumer-grade mobile applications to our transportation, engineering and mechanical forces. Whether it's an application for reporting railcar pickups and set-offs, obtaining track authority or recording bridge inspections, we are providing information where and when our employees need it in order to better manage their workday. To wrap up, Slide 10 is a snapshot of our progress on operating safely. We've been aggressively hiring and have a strong focus on equipping our workforce with the training and tools to perform safely and efficiently. I want to thank our entire workforce for their focus on the job at hand throughout the very dynamic third quarter. I am pleased with our progress, but we'll never be satisfied until we reach zero accidents and injuries. Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Ed. Claude Elkins : Thank you, Cindy, and good morning, everyone. All right. Turning to Slide 12, let's review our results for the third quarter where we achieved record quarterly results in several categories. Total revenue improved 17% year-over-year to $3.3 billion as fuel surcharge and favorable price conditions more than offset a 2% decline in volume. Most notably, revenue per unit, excluding fuel, increased significantly and established a new record in both our merchandise sector and for Norfolk Southern overall. These results reflect a strong price environment and the deliberate efforts of our commercial teams to pursue these opportunities. Before I comment on our individual business groups, I would like to address the impact of our collaborative mitigation efforts in response to a potential labor disruption this quarter. Coming out of August, we were encouraged by the upward trajectory of our volumes. As we move through September and concerns of a labor disruption grew stronger, we acted to guard against the potentially negative impacts on our customers and the communities that we serve in keeping with our no-surprises approach to customer engagement. We spoke with our customers early on about our plans to limit the risk of stranded, hazardous materials and security-sensitive freight like Intermodal by restricting service for these products. We estimate that this approach accounted for roughly 40% to 50% of the volume decline in the quarter or $20 million to $25 million in lost revenue, mostly in our Intermodal markets. Our goal as a customer-centric organization is to gain credibility as a transparent and trusted service provider so that our customers integrate NS further into their supply chain needs. We can only achieve that goal with proactive communication and planning that minimizes disruption. Our customers told us that they appreciated our industry-leading communication, and we're confident that our approach will deliver long-term value for Norfolk Southern, for our shareholders and for our customers. We are pleased that a labor disruption was avoided, and we remain committed to providing quality service that our customers can rely on for their supply chain needs. Now continuing to our business group's performance in the third quarter. Merchandise volume was down 2% year-over-year, driven by declines in our steel and ethanol markets that were partially offset by higher demand for sand and aggregates. With respect to steel, service challenges related to equipment availability negatively impacted our ability to meet demand. Ethanol shipments were also down as consumption of gasoline declined in the third quarter on a year-over-year basis. On the positive side, shipments of sand increased more than 43% year-over-year on higher demand related to the strong market for natural gas production. Aggregates were also up due to higher levels of construction activity. Merchandise revenue improved 13% year-over-year to a quarterly record of $1.9 billion on higher revenue from fuel surcharges and from price gains. Moving on to Intermodal, revenue improved 16% for the quarter despite a 5% decline in volume. Revenue per unit reached a record level this quarter, driven by higher revenue from fuel surcharge and price. Intermodal shipments continue to be pressured by supply chain congestion and equipment shortages. This temporary shift was felt most strongly in our domestic business, where volume was down 4% year-over-year. International Intermodal volume declines were driven primarily by car supply and private chassis shortages, both reducing customer demand for inland point Intermodal and limiting our ability to satisfy that demand. Lastly, coal market conditions were again favorable for us this quarter, enabling us to deliver 43% growth in revenue for the franchise from volume growth, price improvement and fuel surcharge revenue. Volume growth was led by shipments of utility coal that were up on higher demand spurred by high natural gas prices. Export coal volume was also up due to some carryover from the second quarter and generally improved coal supply. Coal volume growth was partially offset by year-over-year declines in coke shipments due to facility closures. Overall, our performance for the quarter reflects continued progress on our strategic plan to drive value for our customers and shareholders while simultaneously working to address pressures related to volume. Moving to our outlook for the remainder of the year on Slide 13. Our service is trending in the right direction, and we expect that to be a tailwind to volumes in the fourth quarter. Additionally, we're optimistic that consumer spending and manufacturing activity will support volumes for the remainder of the year. Those expectations are somewhat muted in light of looming recession risks and tightening financial conditions that are pressuring economic activity, especially in interest rate-sensitive markets like housing. Volume in our merchandise segment will benefit from growing activity in automotive markets, with U.S. light vehicle production currently expected to increase in the fourth quarter of '22 compared to 2021. Also contributing to growth will be new opportunities to move corn and other grains. Much of the Southeast corn crop is down significantly versus last year. This is likely to increase demand for Midwest-originated corn by rail. Since emerging from the pandemic low, manufacturing activity has been increasing at a steady rate. But we're beginning to see that growth level off with forecasts calling for growth to moderate to 3% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. As the Fed tightens interest rates, mortgage rates have increased to levels that are cooling the housing market. This reduced demand affects several of our merchandise as well as Intermodal markets. Overall, we expect merchandise volumes to be relatively flat in the fourth quarter with some upside potential as service continues to recover. Within Intermodal, our expectation is for volume to be down slightly year-over-year with opportunities from easing terminal congestion and equipment supply being offset by expectations for weaker demand and a softening truck market. On the domestic side, national Intermodal volume trends are showing signs of slowing, suggesting weaker peak season demand. However, consumer spending, which has historically been a big driver of this market, is currently forecasted to hold steady through the end of the year, providing underlying support for our domestic Intermodal volumes. We continue to see volume opportunity for domestic Intermodal as our service recovers, and we expect customers to shift loads from the highway to rail as we intently focus on improving domestic Intermodal service. International Intermodal will continue to struggle with congestion and equipment supply, and we expect Intermodal storage charges to remain elevated so long as those issues continue. When supply chain congestion does ease, we expect to deliver additional international volume for customers as Inland Point Intermodal, or IPI, becomes more attractive. And finally, our expectations for coal are that volumes will continue to improve year-over-year in the fourth quarter driven by strength in the markets for both utility and export coal. EIA's latest forecast is for natural gas prices to remain elevated through the end of the year. This will increase demand for coal as a competitive alternative. Seaborne coal prices are expected to remain at relatively high levels through the end of the year, indicating continued demand for U.S. coals abroad. We also anticipate increased coal supply in the fourth quarter, primarily for export, which will create opportunities for coal volume growth. To summarize, we have a number of uncertain market signals in front of us right now, but our focus remains on impacting the things that we can control to deliver quality service to our customers and increase value for our shareholders. Overall, we have a fantastic portfolio of customers. And as always, I want to take this opportunity to thank them for their business and for their ongoing partnership. I will now turn it over to Mark for an update on our financial results. Mark George : Thank you, and good morning. Starting on Slide 15, Ed walked you through the drivers of our 17% growth in revenues. You'll see operating expense of $355 million or 21%, and that includes a $117 million true-up to our compensation accruals based on the terms of the tentative labor agreements. This resulted in the operating ratio increasing year-over-year to 62% for the quarter. Operating income grew $136 million or 12% despite that headwind. EPS was up 34% or $1.04, thanks to strong earnings growth coupled with share shrink, but also from an adjustment to income tax expense related to Pennsylvania's rate reduction that was enacted in the quarter. You will recall we did signal this in our second quarter earnings release. Let's take a moment on Slide 16 to drill specifically into the labor cost adjustments that we reported. As I mentioned, we increased our wage accruals by $117 million in Q3, with $88 million of that amount related to past periods and $29 million related specifically to Q3 2022. The columns represent the period in which the adjustments relate. These amounts, including the impact of the bonus payments, represents more than 2x what we had been assuming. We anticipate another $23 million of incremental expense in Q4, bringing the total amount for the year to $140 million, which represents as much as 110 basis points of headwind to the full year OR from what we had been expecting. It is also worth noting that there is an additional $50 million of incremental label cost that will be capitalized into property additions this year. Now let's take a moment on Slide 17 to reconcile the drivers of OR and EPS since there are some movers in the quarter. The impact of the $88 million out-of-period wage accruals in Q3 was meaningful, representing a 270 basis point headwind to the OR and $0.28 on EPS. We did have a favorable legal settlement in the quarter that provided a $0.05 of help to EPS and 40 basis points of help on the OR. The favorable state tax rate change caused a $136 million reduction to our deferred tax liability, which equates to $0.58 of EPS lift. That leaves a core improvement in EPS of $0.69 and improvement in the operating ratio of 50 basis points, which, I'll point out, includes the absorption of 90 basis points of headwind from the $29 million in-period incremental labor cost adjustments that I spoke to on the prior slide. Moving now to Slide 18 and the changes in operating expenses of $355 million, which represents a 21% increase year-over-year. Fuel was the primary driver, up $175 million or 84% due almost entirely to price. But as Cindy noted, we did enjoy benefits associated with a 3% fuel efficiency improvement. Compensation and benefits, it is up 21% due to the elevated labor costs associated with the tentative agreements. Moving on, you'll see purchase services and rents collectively up $52 million. Inflation and slower network speed continue to drive up these 2 cost categories. Materials, claims and other expenses were down 4% or $7 million year-over-year, helped in part from the $15 million favorable legal settlement in the other category. Turning now to Slide 19 for the P&L below operating income. Other income was an expense of $2 million in the quarter, $16 million unfavorable compared to last year driven by losses on the company-owned life insurance investments due to negative equity and fixed income market returns in the quarter. While pretax income was up 11% in the quarter, net income was up 27% due to the 12.4% effective tax rate in the quarter, thanks to the benefit recorded from the state tax rate change. EPS was up 34%, greater than net income growth supported by our capital allocation strategy that includes share repurchases. Shifting to Slide 20. Cash from operations through 9 months is up $111 million while property additions were higher by $257 million. As we discussed last quarter, I expect capital expenditures to be at the high end of the $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion guidance range, with materials inflation and now incremental wage inflation creating meaningful headwinds. Free cash flow conversion stands at 86%. Shareholder distributions have been strong this year with a 15% increase to our dividends plus continuing solid share repurchase activity. And with that, I'll hand back over to Alan. Alan Shaw : Thank you, Mark. Noting the considerable changes that occurred in the third quarter, I'd like to update you on our outlook for the balance of 2022. As you'll see on Slide 21, based on the strong Q3 revenue performance, we now see full year revenue growth of 13% plus year-over-year. Ongoing strength in RPU driven by fuel surcharges and strong price gains are helping us overcome lagging volumes which, as Ed laid out, we expect to be flattish overall in Q4. Turning to the operating ratio. We are tracking to our previous guidance, excluding the impact from the tentative labor agreements. Mark laid out $140 million of incremental impact for the year, which is roughly 110 basis points of OR headwind. As such, we now expect the all-in OR for the full year to be roughly 62% based on our current assessment of the market. Since I became CEO in May, you have heard me speak to the strengths of our team and culture, our powerful network and the macroeconomic trends supporting highway-to-rail conversion. I have shared some thoughts on our customer-centric operations-driven approach and spoken to the bright future ahead for Norfolk Southern. I continue to be encouraged by my engagements with all of our team members and their commitment to serving our customers. As we approach our December 6 Investor Day, we are eager to share a more detailed view of our long-term strategy for value creation. We will now open the call to questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question today will be coming from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Justin Long : Just to start on the 2022 guidance. If I look at what you're guiding for revenue and your commentary on volumes, it implies that yields will be down at a decent amount sequentially in the fourth quarter. So I was wondering if you could provide more color on that, specifically around coal RPU. And then maybe secondly, there have been a lot of inefficiencies in the network this year. Is there a way you can put a number on what that cost has been in 2022 as we think about service recovering and that potential future tailwind? Alan Shaw : Yes, certainly, we see some potential headwinds in some of our markets moving into the fourth quarter, specifically energy, as you called out. And I'll let Ed talk about the projected impact on the top line. Claude Elkins : Sure. We've seen how seaborne coal prices have fallen, but they have done a new floor and they remain at relatively high levels. On the utility side, we expect there's still a lot of demand out there for that. You factor in what's going on in Europe, and we feel pretty good on the utility side on the steam coal side. The met coal side is a different story. There's a lot of cross currents and headwinds, particularly from China that we see. Steel production in China remains muted, and the housing situation there, which consumes a tremendous amount of steel in that market, remains off kilter, so to speak. So we are more guarded about the met coal side of the business. Does that answer your question? Alan Shaw : Well, and also, Ed, talk about your outlook for fuel surcharge revenue. Claude Elkins : Yes. Fuel surcharge, when we look at the forward curves and we know we have a 2-month lag, we are expecting that there is a headwind. That's when we come into play in the fourth quarter. Justin Long : Okay. So it sounds like it's more action of fuel and coal RPU versus any slowdown in core price. Alan Shaw : That's right. Claude Elkins : Yes, we -- you've heard us talk about this before. We price to the value of our service in the market, and we're very diligent about that. We are confident with our commercial teams that we're identifying places we're adding value. We had -- we'll see RPU less fuel records in merchandise and overall this quarter, and we've had almost 6 years of revenue improvement or RPU improvement in Intermodal and almost 7 years on our merchandise side. That's through a lot of up and down cycles, freight recessions and freight boom times, and we've consistently been able to deliver. So we're very focused on that side of the business. Alan Shaw : And as we price to the value of our product, the value of our product is improving. Claude Elkins : Yes. Justin Long : Got it. And maybe, Mark, on the network inefficiency cost question? Mark George : Yes. Clearly, we're suffering incremental service costs related to where we are in our service product today. Honestly, it's at least $40 million a quarter, and those things are -- they show up in comp and ben, it shows up in purchase services. And as things improve going into 2023, we'll start to see relief in the P&L there. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Jordan Alliger : So you've talked about volumes and hopefully seeing some improvement there, but I'm just sort of curious when do we see these service metrics more fully translate to volume capability based on demand? And why has there been such a lag? Alan Shaw : Jordan, as we noted, volume is a lag to service. We had seen a lot of improvement in our volume sequentially heading up to the potential work stoppage in mid-September. We're starting to see some improvements now. Ed? Claude Elkins : Yes. And I'll repeat what I said earlier, we felt like we had a lot of momentum going into that strike or the potential for a strike. And we've talked previously about the IPI issue at our railroad, and that continues to impact volumes in the third quarter as our international customer portfolio made decisions to do more port-to-port services, specifically on short-haul lanes that are typically sensitive to spot truck prices. If you look, our revenue per tonne models in Intermodal declined 1% on a 5% volume decline, and that really confirms to us that the headwinds are highest in these very short haul lanes. We see some factors that have driven these IPI decisions like ocean freight rates. They're really reverting to a more normal course. We have a very broad base of international customers. And when you look back pre-pandemic, the IPI business, the Inland Port International, played a significant role in our customer supply chain. And as inland congestion eases, those supply chains are going to return to normal, and we think our customers -- well, we know our customers are telling us that they expect to increase their use of IPI as that happens. We talk to our customers every day, and we are very encouraged by the feedback we're getting. We have customers coming to us that are recognizing the change in our service product for the better and are looking to put additional volume on the railroad. As one example, I would cite the ag markets where we've been able to really participate in some of the spot markets that previously we weren't able to because we have new capacity because of the improvements in our service product. That's just an example. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Christian Wetherbee : I guess we are seeing some warning signals in terms of economic factors, and I guess I just wanted to make sure I understood sort of how you guys are going to manage the network as you sort of potentially deal with those maybe in the first half of next year, maybe over the course of next year. You've got the service improvement underway. It looks like hiring is kind of where you need it to be. I guess how flexible can the network be through potential volume volatility as we kind of progress over the course of the next several quarters? Alan Shaw : Chris, we are intently focused on continuing our service recovery. It is the value of our product. And as Ed noted, we price to the value of the product. And as our product value improves, we continue to see more volume and revenue opportunities for us. We're encouraged by the number of conductor trainees in our pipeline. Right now, it's about 950, which is, I think, pretty close to our high in 2022. And we are continuing to hire for some specific locations. As we've talked about, we have about 95 different true hiring locations. We're going to reassess our legacy assumptions on staffing, and we're not going to make any unilateral commitments on what we're going to do going forward. I will commit that we will be data-driven in our approach, and we're going to make decisions based on the long-term value creation, balancing service, cost control and growth. Cindy, you're thinking about some specific opportunities to add more flexibility. Cynthia Sanborn : Yes. So in the short term, we obviously -- we do have some training opportunities to replenish our locomotive engineer ranks that we set back to conductors and allow us to step them up when we need to because it takes longer to train an engineer than it does a conductor. We'll also be enhancing our Go Team membership, the folks we're going to have in our Go Team group. It won't be a huge number of people, but that will also be a resiliency tactic that we'll take. And in the effort to improve our conductor availability through the downturns that we've had -- or through the challenges that we've had, we've qualified in a single segment because that's where they would stand to work. And now we need to qualify them on other segments, radiating out of that same supply point. So there's a number of actions that we'll take here to make sure we're fortified and ready to go into any upturn. Going through a downturn, we'll manage through these opportunities. And then as we come into an upturn, they'll be available to us. Christian Wetherbee : Okay. That's helpful. And I guess, I think there's been some concern for the industry broadly that if we were to see maybe a more sudden drop-off in volume that the industry would be less sort of able to react as quickly as possible, sort of resulting potentially in worse decremental margins than we've seen in previous downturns. I think that sort of has something to do with furloughing employees, maybe a bit more aggressively in previous times. Any thoughts on whether you think that is a valid concern as we go into next year? Or are there enough levers that you have to pull to be able to offset that? Cynthia Sanborn : Well, I think we -- as you noted, I mean, the labor market is different than in the past, and our recruiting efforts are a little bit different than in the past. We know how long it takes to train and hire an employee, and we talk about having 95 different hiring groups that we have to manage that through. So I will say that we have to make sure we manage through downturns in such a way that we're in a good place to handle the upturns. That's how we're going to manage -- that's how we're going to grow long term. So we have levers such as attrition that can help us if we need it, but we also know that we have to be fortified in having a good hiring pipeline or a line of sight to that hiring pipeline so that we can manage the upturn. We don't just want to manage one side. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Scott Group : Mark, you talked about at least $40 million a quarter of sort of network inefficiencies. I'm wondering how much of storage revenue, though, are we seeing per quarter? And what's a more normal number? So as service gets better, that $40 million of cost goes away, but maybe how much of this storage revenue goes? I'm just trying to understand the puts and takes. Mark George : Yes. Scott, clearly, there is some storage revenue that helps mitigate that, the accessorial revenues that we talked to. And certainly, as service recovers, we'll start to see those accessorial revenues come down. Ed, I don't know if you want to talk about the pacing in which you see that... Claude Elkins : Yes. No, earlier this year, we thought that the supply chains would unlock faster, and we would start to see that storage number come off as customers got more fluid into warehousing on the street. Frankly, that hadn't happened. If you look at many of our hinterland markets, particularly deeper into the Midwest, we continue to see the same issues that we saw earlier. So the storage number continues to remain elevated, and we expect right now that it's going to continue to be elevated in the fourth quarter. I think next year, we're hopeful that supply chains will unlock, and there'll be more opportunities move volume instead of storage. Alan Shaw : And it's also true that while storage revenue is elevated, the year-over-year comps are slowing down. Claude Elkins : Absolutely. We've lapped it, yes. Scott Group : So when you think about the puts and takes for next year, I think it -- probably another good year of pricing, service improvement, some uncertainty with volume wage inflation. Do you think the pieces are there to start getting margins higher again next year? Mark George : Well, we're actually putting together the budget for '23 now, and there's a lot of big assumptions that have to be made. So we'll be back to you with '23 guidance. Certainly, that's our goal at this point in time. We've got to get inflation under control. We've got to try to get some offsets on the top line from that. How much volume we can get is going to be a big lever as well. So we'll come back to you with the '23 numbers. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen. Jason Seidl : I wanted to look a little bit about Intermodal's growth rate and sort of how much do you think it's been impacted by, A, your service levels and, B, some of the labor issues that we saw last quarter. So in other words, what's a good economic base to look at '23 off of '22? Alan Shaw : Intermodal is clearly a growth driver for us going forward. Ed, why don't you talk about how we're going to continue to leverage that unique franchise strength? Claude Elkins : Yes. We think we have the most powerful franchise in North America when it comes to Intermodal. We're located square in the heart of the U.S. consumer markets as well as manufacturing with access -- great access to all the East Coast ports and all the Western railroads. We talk to our customers every day. They are investing for growth. Our channel partners are priming themselves to grow with Norfolk Southern as our service improves. And as our service improves, we're creating additional opportunities for them to satisfy supply chain issues that are still manifesting themselves out there. We know that there's a lot of cross current and a lot of, what I would call, mixed signals out there in the macroeconomic environment. We're encouraged by what's going on in manufacturing, which had a great report in September. Future orders appear to be somewhat of a drag. It's undeniable that with interest rates going up and inflation staying stubbornly high, there is some demand destruction out there. But we're confident that for our customers and for our channel partners, Intermodal is still going to be a great way for them to save money going forward in a very inflationary environment as they take freight off the highway and put it on the railroad. Alan Shaw : Jason, we're looking forward to sharing more of our long-term vision for value creation at our Investor Day in 6 weeks. And clearly, Intermodal is a key component of that. Jason Seidl : I look forward to hearing that down there. I was just trying to get sort of -- if you guys can even put a ballpark figure on sort of how many growth points, service, labor issues and lack of equipment might have cost you this year on a 3-quarter basis so far? Alan Shaw : Well, I think you nailed them all. And then I think you should also add in this IPI issue where the short-haul business from the ports is being trucked. Despite that and despite the fact that our Intermodal volumes were down by 1% in the quarter, as Ed noted, our revenue ton miles in Intermodal were up 5%. Jason Seidl : Got you. So you think that if we didn't have all these issues, you guys have positive volumes at least this year. Alan Shaw : There's absolutely no doubt. Jason Seidl : Okay. Really quick, if I can get one more in. The [indiscernible] tax benefit in the quarter, is there going to be an ongoing benefit that will impact your future tax rate? Mark George : Pretty modest at the total level in any given quarter. It's kind of within that range that we guide. I don't think it's going to adjust the range, the effective tax rate that we guide. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Thomas Wadewitz : Yes. So I'll give you the two questions upfront. So the first one would just be on pricing. Mark, you talked about the big assumptions in the budget for 2023 that you need top line to offset some of the inflation. I wonder maybe for Ed, if you can just give some commentary on how sensitive you think prices in your book to a weaker truckload market and falling truckload contract rates. Can you accelerate pricing against that backdrop? Or is weaker truck something we should really be mindful of? And then the second one is just on volume. I think we've had this assessment that improving service that you're delivering more capacity would translate to stronger volume. It sounds like that's maybe not the case just because the markets are getting a bit weaker. So I don't know if that's right or if you still think there are segments that are going to see stronger volumes as you continue to improve the service. Claude Elkins : Sure. On the revenue side, on the price side, like I said, we've been talking to our customers every single day about where price is going. We've got a great track record of being able to deliver price as we increase the value that we're delivering to our customers, and they can transfer that on. Our service is improving in -- and I will tell you that our customers are confident that as our service improves, they can put additional volume against the railroad. And look, that helps save money for our customers in the long term. We price to the value of the market. We know that there's a lot of noise around the spot market, which goes up and goes down. We stay focused on the long-term trajectory of contract rates, and our customers understand that. Can you repeat your volume question again? Thomas Wadewitz : What -- okay. I guess just to finish that thought, but do you think we ought to be careful about the truck market getting weaker or you say, no, that's not a big impact on our pricing in '23? Alan Shaw : Our RTMs went up 5%. Claude Elkins : Yes. I think the macro economy is going to tell us where we're all going in terms of economic trajectory. We have been able to price and continue to be successful in pricing because of the value that we're delivering to those customers. I think a recession, if there is one coming, or a downturn, that's going to dictate how much volume we can put against the railroad and how much is available to put against the railroad. But we're confident that we're going to be able to do that. On the volume side, I will tell you that we have a strong portfolio of customers that are, like I said, they're -- we stick to the script here, they're investing to grow. We see that happening, and I think as the IPI situation reverts to normal in terms of conditions that allow that, our customers are going to find value in that market as well. Thomas Wadewitz : Okay, yes. And what about Industrial? Like if service improves, do you expect metals and forest products and chemicals volumes to improve in response to that? Claude Elkins : Yes. And in fact, we're seeing, on the bulk side of our network, additional throughput capacity that we're putting up against customers right now in the spot markets. That's indicative of the opportunities that are out there. I think I noted in the third quarter, we had cycle times on equipment that still inhibited our ability to serve everyone that wanted to be served. And so as our fluid improves, we're going to be able to put additional capacity against them, too. Our customers are telling us that there's additional volume out there that they want to put on the railroad. If you look at most of the manufacturing sectors, there's still a lot of unfilled orders out there that they're working through. Even in a -- what I would call a declining demand environment, there's still a lot of back orders. So we're confident about our ability to continue to grow volumes and service improvement. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. The next question will be coming from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Amit Mehrotra : Mark, I just wanted to deconstruct the -- so the guidance of 62% OR, I think includes the $88 million prior period labor adjustments and then $15 million of legal settlements. So I'm just trying to figure out, it looks like it's really like 61.5% if you kind of strip out to maybe extraordinary, if you could just talk about that. And then the implied fourth quarter is something like, I think, like 63% OR or something like that to get to that 61.5%. I mean, you have to go back to like the fourth quarter of '19 to get something that low or high. And yield is up over 20% since then. Revenue is up over 10% since then. So I'm just trying to reconcile, first, if my numbers are correct. And then two, why would there be such a deterioration despite even some of the headwinds based on kind of the improvement you've seen in the business from a yield and service perspective. Mark George : Thanks, Amit. So yes, the guidance that we gave of the 62% for the full year includes the retroactive wage adjustment as well as the ongoing wage adjustments. So basically, the $140 million, it is the all-in including the items that we called out this quarter. So it's -- that's kind of where it comes to. I'm not getting to your 63% number implied for Q4. So if you do the all-in, I think it's largely in line with -- in Q4, it should be largely in line with the full year number. Amit Mehrotra : Okay. Maybe I'll take that offline. But I'm just trying to think like if you strip out the $88 million, you're really looking at -- obviously, that's not an ongoing -- that's prior period. So maybe... Mark George : Correct. Correct. Amit Mehrotra : So maybe 61.5% is kind of the right way to think about the jumping off point as you move into '23. Is that a fair way to think about it? Mark George : Yes. We were -- when you ignore the $88 million and you look at our restated Q3, and then you can look at Q4 inclusive of the $23 million that we told you about, it's obviously -- it's a much lower number than the 62%. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Bascome Majors : As we look out into next year with the visibility into the union labor wage increases, can you talk a little bit about either broader rail inflation or something in a cost per employee kind of context that we can think about modeling, just -- without getting all the way to preliminary guiding next year? Just what sort of cost inflation on the labor front or overall are you expecting versus history? Mark George : Bascome, this is Mark. So the -- if you look at our comp per employee in the third quarter and you take out the retro wage adjustments, it's -- you'll get to about $34,250 for the quarter. And I would probably guide you all to think that same number would apply in Q4 because that is kind of the new number. It's baking in this 7% higher wage that took effect in July. So that would kind of go sideways there in Q4.  And then as you think about 2023, what we typically see in the first quarter is a resetting of the payroll taxes, and so that will knock it up a couple of points in conjunction with assumptions for higher bonus payout as well. So you'd probably see a point or 2 increase in that number going into the first half of next year. And then, of course, when you get to the back half of next year, you have another wage jump that comes from the contractual agreement numbers that you would have seen published. So that will probably go up another few points in the back half. So that's probably the way I would look at it. It probably wants to go up more than a few points, but we will have some service cost relief as service improves and some of those costs that we are incurring related to overtime drayage -- not drayage, sorry, overtime and training costs, et cetera, start to subside. So I would model it out that way. A point or 2 elevation here from that level in the first half and then another, call it, a few points in the second half. Operator : The next question is from the line of Ben Nolan with Stifel. Benjamin Nolan : So as I'm looking at the 4Q sort of service improvements that look like they're having an effect with train speed and dwell and so forth and then matching that up with the increase in headcount that you have, just curious if you can frame in how much of the service improvements, you can say, put at the feet of being more fully staffed or appropriately staffed or whatever versus just sort of the -- well, any other factors that might be helping there. Cynthia Sanborn : Thanks for the question, Ben. I think hiring is a critical part of our service improvement efforts. We established a target that we shared with the STB of about, call it, 7,550 qualified T&Es by mid-2023. And we are ahead of that target as we head into November. And when we think of that number, just so we're really clear, and that top line number, we have to recognize there's 95 hiring locations underneath it. So while that number is important that we also have to have folks in the right critical locations.  I would say another lever that we pulled and we've talked about it in prior quarters is our TOP|SPG operating plan initiative that is in place. It's really helped us, I think, to have a more executable plan. And it's boiled down into a comprehensive review of connection standards, our distributed power playbook, and help us to recalibrate train meet. So as we get closer and closer on time, that fluidity continues to -- allow us to be more fluid, I guess, is the best way to put it. So I would say those 2 things are the biggest levers that we've had. Alan Shaw : Then recall that we implemented the first phase of TOP|SPG at the very end of the second quarter. And then in the third quarter, our train speeds increased by 20%. And as Cindy noted, it applies the principles of PSR, and it's really focused on balance, simplicity and executability. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Jonathan Chappell : Cindy, sticking with some of the service questions and updates to issues from the recent past hasn't been much talk about chassis recently. Is that because the availability there has cleared up meaningfully? And how does that impact as you think about the excess equipment or the spare capacity on the network once you are appropriately resourced and the economic backdrop you're looking at for next year? Alan Shaw : Ed, some of the chassis issues in the past have been our own. Some have been our customers. Could you cover that, please? Claude Elkins : Sure. And we've been successful in getting a portion of our order online of our chassis, and we're seeing that help in terms of fluidity. I will tell you on the international side, there still remains a lot of shortages out there mostly because I believe those units are deployed on the street or at a warehouse. And it continues to be an issue on the international side of the business, particularly in these hinterland markets, as we talked about earlier. We deployed a number of countermeasures which includes some temporary storage facilities that we've been able to open to help accommodate our customers. But we will continue to look for additional fluidity going forward, particularly on the private chassis side. Jonathan Chappell : So Ed, just to be clear. I mean is there any improvement or any line of sight towards improvement because it was in kind of major focus, let's call it, 9 months ago and maybe not so much anymore? But it sounds like it's still having a really big impact, especially on your international Intermodal. Claude Elkins : On the international Intermodal side, it is having an impact, and that's not a chassis or an asset that we control per se. For our chassis on our equipment, we've seen some relief both in terms of the fluidity side, but mostly because we've been able to add some chassis. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Brandon Oglenski : Look, I don't mean to be near term or quarterly focused here, but can we come back to the implied 4Q sequential on the operating ratio? Because, Mark, if I back out the $88 million of prior year accruals and maybe even the legal settlement, it still looks like you're guiding OR up maybe 400 to 500 basis points sequentially, which I think would be one of the worst outcomes if we go back in time for your company. So what are we missing on the cost side? Or is this really a deceleration on the revenue front that we should be thinking? Mark George : Yes. Look, I think the story here, it's mainly a top line story. We see the expenses largely in line with the third quarter when you exclude the labor adjustments that were historic -- I'm sorry, that were retroactively made as well as the favorable legal item that we called out. So really, what we're talking about is more of a top line story. So Ed talked a little bit about the RPU assumptions that we made on energy pricing. Hopefully, that's conservative and that comes back, but it's really less about cost and more about just a little bit of deceleration. Alan Shaw : Well, I want to clear up a point. There's nothing that we're looking at that suggests a 400 to 500 basis point decline or worsening of our OR in the fourth quarter. We don't see that math. Claude Elkins : And our core pricing story remains absolutely intact. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Walter Spracklin : Just a quick housekeeping question on the tax rate. You mentioned that it's not changed. Are we in the 23.5%, 24% range. Is that right? Mark George : Yes. That's -- for the time being, that's where the implied guidance is on the overall tax rate. That includes, obviously, the federal rate, which is at 21%, but it also includes a multitude of states, not just Pennsylvania where we operate. That brings it up a little bit higher. And yes, Pennsylvania's rate goes down a little bit, but we still got all the other state tax where we pay. Walter Spracklin : Got it. Perfect. Okay. And then my second question here is on carryover impacts, whether it's headwinds or tailwinds that would impact OR going into 2023. And one of your peers mentioned they started out with a target for the beginning of the year. Obviously, you weren't able to achieve it due to the headwinds, but indicated that it's off the table for next year due to some of the carryovers. I don't know if Cindy is the best one to ask this, but is there -- is there headwinds to what you would have expected your OR to be, say, the beginning of the year that won't allow you to kind of achieve some of the benefits akin to what other industry peers are seeing? Or is that kind of specific to them? Do you believe that you can see a material improvement in your OR because those headwinds don't exist going into 2023? Alan Shaw : As I noted before, we're going to be more than happy to share our vision for long-term value creation at our Investor Day in about 6 weeks. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Kenneth Hoexter : So Alan, as you just highlight earlier, I thought that was a really important point on the furloughing and decrementals. I think that's probably one of the most talked about discussions on the future of the railroads, it's going to be what happens, can the rails be as variable as they had been. But I just want to visit on -- did I catch you right? Did you say that labor costs were 2x your target? It seems to be a very big step relative to the other rail gaps. And is there any reason for that? And then I guess on the -- my follow-up on the TOP|SPG, what's the issue now? As you ramp employees, is it equipment chassis? Is it getting the humps back to speed? What else needs to be done going forward here to finish improving the service? Mark George : Yes. Ken, I'll start on the labor costs. I mean, the PEB recommendations were obviously higher than we expected. We laid out very transparently for you the details of how those increases were allocated, including those retro adjustments, and we advised throughout all that we were accruing in line with historical increases and -- which is what we had on the table with labor prior to the PEB. So the adjustment is really just the math. Go ahead. Alan Shaw : Let me talk about the service. We improved our train speed by 20% in the third quarter, and our service metrics are better than what we had projected to the Service Transportation Board earlier this year. Our service metrics and our service product is at a level, as Ed described, that's allowing us to participate in some lucrative spot opportunities that we didn't anticipate. We could participate in a couple of months ago. We made a lot of improvement. What we're allowed to do now because of the health of our network is narrow our focus a little bit more on some specific areas in which we need to continue to improve our service price. That's our focus. It's job priority #1 on Norfolk Southern. Cynthia Sanborn : And I would add on the SPG piece, Ken, that it's a consideration, refinement, simplification, all of those types of things. Again, it's a very PSR-oriented to making sure we get asset turns as we need to and be able to create fluidity that not only helps us from a cost perspective, but it's exactly what our customers need. So there's continuing work going on there as well. Kenneth Hoexter : Can I just ask a clarification? Mark, did you mention the headwind on the lost fuel surcharge for the fourth quarter was there? Or was it just we're going to have a headwind? I don't know if you'd put in on that. Mark George : Actually, Ken, thanks for the opportunity to clear that up a little bit. That was another thing that's driving the fourth quarter operating ratio in the implied math, too, is fuel surcharge. The net fuel surcharge was actually a benefit here in the third quarter. And based on where fuel prices are going, it spins to become a headwind again just like it was in the first half. Kenneth Hoexter : I appreciate that. Did you put a level or a number, or just that's going to be... Mark George : I did not. I did not. It's going to be -- well, we have to see where the prices are going. We've just seen a dramatic spike just in the past 1.5 weeks, which initially we weren't expecting to see, and we thought that maybe we would not have the headwinds that we're facing. But right now, it's -- fuel has moved up. And because of the lag effect, we'll end up having an OR headwind here in the fourth quarter. It won't catch up until the first quarter.  So again, in periods of a rising fuel, because of the lag, we end up with OR headwinds. When fuel stabilizes and starts to go down, you tend to get fuel tailwinds. So in Q3, we ended up having a reprieve on that and we got some OR help from the fuel surcharge program, but it looks like it's going to spin again to a headwind here in the fourth quarter. Just like we had in the first half. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ari Rosa with Credit Suisse. Ariel Rosa : So I wanted to start with just a philosophical question. Just maybe you could address how you're thinking about balancing desires for volume growth versus OR improvement. I know for a long time, I think the argument for NS has been, well, we grow -- we're going to outgrow the industry, and therefore, maybe our ORs will lag peers a little bit. Maybe you could just update us how you're thinking about the tension between those two?  And here we are in an environment where you're obviously adding resources in terms of headcount and other things, but you're looking for volume growth to be essentially flat in the fourth quarter. So maybe you could talk about that and the opportunity to maybe get volume over time to kind of meet those higher resource levels. Alan Shaw : Yes. Ari, we firmly believe that service and margin improvement support each other. And frankly, you saw that in the third quarter. The service improved. Our margin improved versus the second quarter. With respect to fourth quarter volumes, just note that normal seasonality would suggest generally about a 5% decline in volume in the fourth quarter relative to the third. So as our service continues to improve, we believe we're going to outperform normal seasonality on our volumes. And longer term, our commitment is to industry competitive margins with above market growth. Ariel Rosa : Okay. That's helpful. And then just really quickly, Alan, you mentioned that you're getting increased inquiries from customers based on kind of some of these service improvements. I was hoping you could just add some color around where those inquiries are coming in, what's the nature of those inquiries. Again, it's a little difficult to reconcile with the notion of volume growth maybe being a little bit flat or at least as implied by the guide. Just maybe give us some color around the nature of those conversations with customers. Alan Shaw : Ed, you're talking to our customers every day, as am I, but you're certainly much closer to this. Claude Elkins : Yes. Overall sentiment from our customers is that things have improved, and we're continuing to move in the right direction. We're hearing that every day from a range with customers.  One thing that we're certain about is as we increase train speed and reduce the amount of dwell, we're going to have more capacity to deliver value to our customers, and we're hearing that from them. I'll use the ag markets as an example on the bulk side where we are seeing customers come to us and come to us with spot opportunities that we probably wouldn't have been able to execute on in prior periods, but we're able to now. And so we're diligently looking at these opportunities, and it really means looking at opportunities where we can be successful and add value. There are several of those on the bulk side, and we'll continue to look for them. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Cherilyn Radbourne : I was just looking for a bit of clarification on the $88 million retroactive labor accrual and the extent to which it reflects base wage increases versus the proposed bonuses. And to the extent that it's more weighted to bonuses versus the base wage increase, should we then assume that, that means the company was correctly anticipating base wage inflation and, therefore, should have been passing that on as contracts roll? Or how should we think about that accrual? Mark George : Yes. We didn't provide the split of impact between the bonus and the base wage, Cherilyn, but we can -- let me look at providing that to you offline. But I do think that we are -- the overall impact that we've got from the $88 million that relates to 2020, 2021 and the first half of 2022 now becomes something that we have to absorb over time and mitigate with not just pricing, but with productivity and efficiency in the go forward. And that's our goal on how we offset that. Operator : The next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research. Jeffrey Kauffman : Congratulations. A lot of my questions have been answered, so let me just go with one modeling detail question. Debt was relatively flat. Interest expense, up $7 million. Obviously, interest rates arising. Can you give us a sense of your interest rate sensitivity? And let's say, the Fed does an additional 150 basis points here and then slows down. What would be a good way to think about run rate interest expense as we enter 2023? Mark George : Well, Jeff, I mean, it will -- look, the weighted average interest rate in our overall debt portfolio today is below current rates. So with every new debt issuance that we have, it will be at higher rates than the average. It will start -- so as old maturities roll off, new ones come on. It's going to -- interest will start to go up a little bit. We're not so worried, frankly, because we do have a portfolio of debt that exceeds $14 billion or so. So I don't think it's going to be a meaningful drag on us going forward. And we haven't really seen the interest rates at levels yet that caused me much concern. Jeffrey Kauffman : Okay. So more a function of new issuance replacing old issuance as opposed to any interest rate sensitivity on future increases. Mark George : Correct. Alan Shaw : We thank you for joining our call, and we look forward to continuing these discussions at our December 6 Investor Day. Operator : Thank you. This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Luke Nichols, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. Mr. Nichols, you may begin. Luke Nichols : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Please note that during today's call, we will make certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to future events or future performance of Norfolk Southern, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and may differ materially from actual results. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full disclosure of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. Our presentation slides are available at nscorp.com in the Investors section along with our reconciliation of any non-GAAP measures used today to the comparable GAAP measures. Turning to Slide 3. It's now my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's President and Chief Executive Officer, Alan Shaw. Alan Shaw : Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Norfolk Southern's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Here with me today are Ed Elkins, our Chief Marketing Officer; and Mark George, our Chief Financial Officer. I'm also pleased to welcome Paul Duncan, who moved into the role of Chief Operating Officer on January 1. At our Investor Day last month, we shared our strategy to create long-term shareholder value through a balanced approach of reliable and resilient service, continuous productivity improvement and smart and sustainable growth. At the heart of that strategy is a service product that allows us to compete in that $860 billion truck in logistics market and gives our customers the confidence to build Norfolk Southern into their supply chain. I was at the Midwest Association of Rail shippers winter meeting last week, talking with customers about our new strategy. and the reactions were extremely positive. Now our job is to prove it consistently. With performance, we made great strides to close the year and are encouraged by our progress. We will continue to refine and evolve to provide a service product to market values. Service is at the best it's been in more than 2 years, and customers are noticing. Volumes in December were at 52-week highs, outperforming typical seasonality as Ed and Paul's teams work collaboratively with our customers to attract business to Norfolk Southern, overcoming headwinds associated with a slower network in the first 3 quarters that constricted our capacity. Our team persevered adapted and achieved strong results in a challenging year. For both the fourth quarter and full year 2022, we were able to achieve double-digit growth in both revenue and EPS. We established new records for full year revenue, operating income, and other metrics that the team will detail later this morning. Also this quarter, we finalized national contracts with the unions representing our craft colleagues. These agreements recognize the hard work and dedication of our frontline railroaders with historic wage increases in an unparalleled health and welfare benefits package. With national bargaining now complete, we started discussions at the local level to address important quality of life issues. I would like to thank the entire Norfolk Southern team for their incredible effort during the fourth quarter and throughout all of 2022. I'm proud of the improvement our team has delivered and the momentum we have created. Our relentless focus on service continues in 2023. You'll hear more from Paul momentarily about how our across-the-board improvement is now allowing us to target specific opportunities for service and productivity enhancements. We recognize that the macroeconomic environment in which we operate is uncertain, and you'll hear more about the impact of that from Ed and Mark. Longer term, we are building on the momentum we carry into 2023. And of course, we've charted in our new strategy. As you heard at our Investor Day, we believe Norfolk Southern is uniquely positioned to deliver long-term shareholder value through top-tier revenue and earnings growth, industry competitive margins and balanced capital deployment. We will get there by being a customer-centric operations-driven service organization, and we look forward to sharing our progress with you. Now I'll turn it over to Paul for more detail on the improved service we are providing to our customers. Paul? Paul Duncan : Thank you, Alan, and good morning. I am excited to be leading the operating team as we implement the vision set forth this last quarter. My focus since assuming the role of Chief Operating Officer has been in 2 areas : collaborating with marketing and our customers to convert improved service into increased volume on the network; and getting out to talk with our field leaders about our new strategy to be a customer-centric operations-driven organization. The team has tremendous pride in Norfolk Southern and the feedback we are hearing is overwhelmingly positive. When we talk about growth, our people hear stability and opportunity. One 40-year Norfolk Southern veteran in Birmingham told me last week, he has never been more optimistic about the direction and culture of the company. I'll begin with a safety discussion on Slide 5. Our injury frequency rate improved 22%. Every conversation will begin with safety in 2023 and beyond. Operating safely is the the communities that we serve. This is an area where we have made great strides, but even one serious incident is too many. Thank you to those closest to the ballast line for the gains we achieved in safety in 2022 and and for the efforts we will all make safely delivering in 2023. Moving to Slide 6. Since we spoke last at our Investor Day, our service is the best it has been in more than 2 years. Our leadership, the implementation of our simpler, more executable operating plan top SPG and our continued resource adds have contributed to significant improvements in service for all of our customers. For premium intermodal, we safely delivered a perfect peak season for our largest parcel customer. Domestic intermodal performance has improved. Average container transit times have been reduced by 12 hours between Chicago and the Northeast, our largest corridor, with consistency also now meeting expectations. Merchandise performance is consistent, and this is another segment where our improved velocity is creating capacity. Both trains are cycling at historic best transit turn times, maximizing our asset utilization across commodities. You'll note that train speed has continued to climb from our low point last year with terminal dwell also creating capacity for growth. Our service product has turned the corner, and we are focused on building further reliability and resiliency into our network that our customers expect moving forward. Moving to our productivity update on Slide 7. We are committed to our balanced approach to service, productivity and growth. Let's start with locomotives. We have made solid progress on getting more productive use out of our fleet. You can see that here in terms of increasing our locomotive miles per day. At Investor Day, I referenced the flywheel effect that speeding up the network will produce. This is the start of that flywheel, which produced a 6% improvement last quarter and has improved 12% so far in January. Getting our locomotives moving more efficiently ensures we are creating capacity for growth. Next, we have grown our workforce, and that has been a critical element to our service improvement. Our GTMs were flat versus last year while our training pipeline has remained above steady state levels, pressuring workforce productivity. This is a good news story looking forward. as we are building the capacity we need to be reliable and resilient with the gains in service that we have made. We will build upon this foundation to drive greater workforce productivity as we bring volume back on the railroad. Lastly, we have set another quarterly record for fuel efficiency. Our increasing fluidity certainly has played a role alongside our portfolio of fuel efficiency initiatives including our fleet modernizations and idling compliance initiatives. Improving productivity is key to our balanced plan, and we are going to continue driving sustainable efficiency gains to provide value for our shareholders and our customers. On Slide 8, I will recap the industry-leading progress that we have made on hiring in 2022 and talk about what we see ahead. We entered the year in the very early stages of priming the conductor training pipeline and ramped up in record time, which was no easy task given the tightness in the labor market. We increased training wages, drove efficiencies into our onboarding process Jump started a grassroots campaign leveraging referral incentives and more. These efforts have paid off with much of our network reaching the minimum staffing levels determined by our data-driven approach. We are now focused on shoring up the remaining crew bases that are short, and we are determined to do so in 2023. As we make progress, we are deploying go teams more effectively and are executing the resiliency vision laid out at Investor Day by cross-qualifying crews and expanding training efforts. Moving to Slide 9. I will cover a few items that we are working on as we enter the new year. First, let's talk about the culture of continuous improvement we are building. We have greatly improved service and to bring our vision of long-term service resilience to reality. We know we have to keep getting better. Let me provide a few examples. With Intermodal, we are using the initial rollout and learnings from our high-frequency operating plan discussed at Investor Day, along with our perfect peak season to improve capacity and reliability across our intermodal franchise. On the merchandise side, we are applying continuous improvement principles identifying and implementing those next levers that will drive even greater resiliency and resource productivity to move cars faster and more consistently. We are building tools as part of our digital transformation to provide more actionable and timely information to a more empowered workforce. These are just a few examples of how we are driving continuous improvement into our DNA. Next, we are slated to modernize another 115 locomotives this year, converting them from DC to AC traction technology and giving them a full rejuvenation. These 115 rebuilds will reduce locomotive hauling capability equivalent to 150 DC locomotives, providing additional capacity for growth with fewer assets. Our DC to AC conversions will continue to provide even greater fuel efficiency and added pulling power to increase train productivity further. Our DC to AC conversion strategy will provide further opportunities to grow train size and increased train productivity, which we discussed at Investor Day. We have made marked progress on this long-term initiative. And just this month, we increased train size 53% in 1 of our 2 highest volume export cholines which will provide greater capacity and resiliency in our customer supply chain. Next up, let's talk about our capital investments. Our best-in-class engineering team safely delivered a productive year with more than 520 track miles of rail replaced, the most NS has done in 3 decades. We installed 10% more ties in 2022 than in 2021 with the same level of production teams and our servicing teams worked 27% more track than in 2021. We are committed to safely building and maintaining a reliable and resilient infrastructure for our customers productively. We're primed to execute on our capital plan in support of safety, resiliency, growth and productivity -- this will include a longer siding between Cincinnati and Fort Wayne, which will incorporate additional resilience into our train network. This is just one of the efforts we will highlight as the year progresses. Lastly, we are intensely focused on converting the capacity gains that we have made with top SPG and our disciplined execution of the plan into additional volume moving over the railroad in 2023. Our intermodal, merchandise and bulk service are all now consistently performing at high levels of service across our network. I will now hand it to Ed to expand on the market outlook and talk about how we can put this capacity to work. Thank you. Ed Elkins : Thank you, Paul. It's great to have you with us, and good morning to everyone. Let's review our results for the fourth quarter, starting on Slide 11. Overall, revenue grew 13% year-over-year to $3.2 billion, with higher revenue from fuel surcharge and price improvements more than offsetting a 1% decline in volume. The pricing environment remains strong and we capitalize by delivering our 24th consecutive quarter of year-over-year RPU less fuel growth in intermodal and our 30th out of 31 quarters in merchandise. Speaking of merchandise, Volumes recovered to prior year levels as service improved in the fourth quarter, enhancing our ability to drive value for our customers. Our largest gains were in the sand and proppants market to support the recent surge in demand for natural gas production followed by corn and soybeans also driven by exceptionally high demand. We saw declines in our steel and automotive markets where equipment availability was particularly challenged. As Paul highlighted earlier, we are making meaningful progress on improving car velocity in our merchandise fleets, and we started to see the results of that increased velocity toward the end of the quarter. Merchandise revenue increased 12% year-over-year to $1.9 billion and revenue per unit, excluding fuel, reached a record level from price gains and positive mix. Shifting to Intermodal. Total revenue improved 10% year-over-year as higher revenue from fuel surcharge and price gains more than offset a 4% decline in volume. The volume decline was concentrated within our domestic lines of business where headwinds from a loosening truck market and higher inventories heading into the holiday season negatively impacted demand. Conversely, our international lines of business grew in the fourth quarter. Our international intermodal volume rose 5% year-over-year as several of our customers shifted back to inland Point intermodal services amid lower ocean rates and easing supply chain congestion. Total intermodal revenue per unit and revenue per unit, excluding fuel, were up year-over-year on higher fuel revenue and price gains. If we turn to coal, our results for the quarter reflect both our success in capturing upside revenue potential from the market dynamics as well as our ability to create capacity for growth through improved service. Coal revenue for the quarter increased 28%, driven by price gains, volume growth, higher revenue from fuel surcharge and liquidated damages from prior volume shortfalls. Both revenue per unit and revenue per unit, excluding fuel, reached record levels, reflecting the value of our market-based pricing approach in these volatile energy markets. We were able to leverage increased equipment availability from improved cycle times to capture more utility coal business, which led to 9% volume gain in utility coal in the fourth quarter. Our export coal markets also grew due to higher demand driven by geopolitical conflict. Overall, coal volumes increased 8% in the quarter, and this volume growth was partially offset by year-over-year declines in coke shipments resulting from facility closures. Let's move to Slide 12 for the full year of 2022. Total revenue for the year reached $12.7 billion, a 14% increase from 2021 driven by higher revenue from fuel surcharge and price gains, partially offset by volume declines. We delivered record level total revenue and revenue less fuel, revenue per unit and revenue per unit, excluding fuel, despite 3% decline in total volume. Volume headwinds were strongest in our intermodal franchise, where a weakening truck market and supply chain congestion led to declines in annual volume. We saw growth in our coal business as a strong export market and a strong global market for energy increased volumes for coal on NS. Our performance as the year progressed into 2022 provides evidence that our recovering service product is providing momentum to the commercial side of our business. We're working together internally to enhance our offerings in the marketplace and to ensure that we are delivering the value our customers need to be successful. Lastly, if you will join me on Slide 13, our outlook for 2023 is cautiously optimistic amid uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment and some signals of a slowdown in activity. Our improving service levels will drive opportunities for modal conversion from truck and increase our capacity to address unmet demand. At the same time, economic conditions could be a headwind to volume. At least in the near term, while lower fuel prices and accessorial revenues will temper our revenue per unit. Within merchandise, we anticipate that macroeconomic conditions will pressure a variety of the markets that we participate in. We're mindful of recent weakness in industrial production, particularly with respect to manufacturing, and that drives many of our markets. Current forecast for manufacturing in the U.S. shows contraction in 2023 as businesses rightsize inventories to demand. Additionally, the weak housing market will be a headwind to many of our industrial businesses and we expect this weakness to persist in 2023 as the housing market adjusts to higher interest rates. Volumes will also be supported by increased equipment availability and overall network fluidity. Looking at intermodal, volume growth will be dependent on the macroeconomic environment, although our improving service levels will create capacity for growth. Total revenue will be pressured by lower fuel surcharges and reduced storage revenue as supply chains continue to normalize throughout the year. Household balance sheets are supported by excess savings accumulated during the pandemic and credit remains available for many despite becoming more expensive. And so long as the U.S. consumer remains resilient, we would expect supportive demand for intermodal. Weakness in the truck market at the start of the year, along with housing will be a headwind but we anticipate the truck market to rebalance supply and demand later this year. Our international business will continue to benefit from lower ocean rates and improving supply chain fluidity at inland points, prompting a return of our customers to Inland Point Intermodal. Turning to coal. The current outlook for the utility and export coal markets supports a flat to modest year-over-year volume improvement. While overall utility demand is likely to remain flat, our capacity to handle more of that demand will increase with efficiency and productivity improvements on our network. For export, Norfolk Southern will benefit from additional coal supply coming online despite softening seaborne prices. We expect the global supply of met coal to continue to be restricted by geopolitical factors which should support demand for U.S.-sourced coal. We will experience tough coal pricing comps in the first half of the year, which will pressure export met ARPUs on a year-over-year basis. Overall, we are energized by our recent momentum heading into '23, and we are focused on leveraging that momentum to drive value for our customers and grow our business. Uncertainty and downside risks are certainly still present, but we're going to continue to focus on the things that we can control to successfully execute our strategic plan and results for our customers and for our shareholders. And lastly, I'd like once again to recognize our customers for their partnership throughout 2022 and thank them for their business. We appreciate all of their support as we move forward in 2023 with sustained momentum toward delivering the service product that they need to succeed. I will now turn it over to Mark for an update on our financial results. Mark George : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 15. As you heard from Ed, we had another quarter of strong revenue performance, up 13%. Operating expenses in the quarter were up $333 million or 19% year-on-year, driven primarily by elevated fuel prices and some significant adverse accrual adjustments that I will describe shortly which had an outsized impact on the operating ratio. Operating income at $1.18 billion set a fourth quarter record. EPS was $3.42, up double digits year-over-year. Moving to Slide 16. Let's reconcile the drivers of the changes in operating income, operating ratio and earnings per share. Talking specifically to operating income, the $52 million improvement was aided by the first row in the bottom section, a favorable wage accrual true-up related to our commitment to getting retroactive wages distributed to our employees before the end of the year. It was not only the right thing to do, but the acceleration created the added benefit of saving payroll taxes for employees as well as for the company. That adjustment provided a $16 million expense savings, which equates to 50 basis point tailwind to the OR and a nickel boost to EPS. But in the second row of the reconciliation at the bottom you will see that there was a $57 million expense headwind from numerous unexpected adverse items in the claims category that I'll put in 3 buckets. Accrual adjustments related to personal injury reserves based on actuarial studies, adjustments to environmental reserves based on activity and costs associated with derailments that occurred during the quarter. Combined, these adverse items versus a smaller positive adjustment last Q4 results in $57 million of year-over-year headwind in the fourth quarter, which equates to 180 basis points OR drag and $0.19 of EPS. Absent those 2 reconciling items I just detailed, core operating income growth was actually $93 million, and that translates to EPS growth of $0.44. The OR contraction at 180 basis points reflects lower incrementals driven by the net inflation impact as well as service-related costs. So let's drill into the operating expenses for the quarter now on Slide 17. Fuel was again a primary expense driver this quarter, up $141 million or 62% due to elevated fuel prices. Materials & Other was up $78 million, which included the $71 million increase in claims that was heavily impacted by the items we just discussed. Compensation and benefits were up $55 million or 9%, driven by elevated wages from the new labor contracts as well as higher employment levels. Purchased services were up $48 million or 10% in the quarter, driven primarily from continued inflationary pressures, costs related to our service environment as well as technology-related costs as we progress our digital transformation. Some of the inflation impacts are associated with intermodal operations that more than offset savings from lower intermodal volumes. Depreciation was up $11 million year-over-year, consistent with prior quarters. But let me point out that we are nearing completion of our periodic roadway depreciation study and the findings will result in a quarterly step-up in our 2023 depreciation expense. You can expect in 2023 that the quarterly year-over-year growth will be around double what you see here, meaning that the full year impact will be a step-up in the $40 million to $50 million range. Shifting to Slide 18. Let's look at the results below the line. After spending much of the year as a net expense, other income flipped back to a more normal profile and amounted to $34 million, an increase of $13 million over last year. Net income in the quarter was up $30 million or 4%. EPS growth at 10% exceeded the net income growth due to strong share repurchase activity. Turning now to Slide 19 and looking at the full year results. EPS was $13.88, an increase of $1.77 or 15% relative to 2021 and driven by record revenues of $12.7 billion, which was up 14% compared to 2021. As you look at the full year OpEx and operating ratio headwinds versus prior year, Recall the adverse impact of the wage settlement. Moving to Slide 20. Property additions at $1.9 billion ended the year exactly as we had been guiding. We had another strong year for shareholder distributions with over $4 billion returned again in 2022, with over 12.6 million shares repurchased. Dividend distributions were up 14%, and you will have read about our Board just approving a 9% or $0.11 increase to our quarterly dividend here in the first quarter. All this demonstrates our commitment to return capital to shareholders. And with that, I'll now turn it back over to Alan. Alan Shaw : Thanks, Mark. Let's turn to Slide 21. Our outlook for 2023 reflects the uncertainty of a challenging macro landscape in which the path of the demand environment and inflation are unclear. At this time, we see full year revenue level with 2022 performance. We expect to be able to absorb volume pressure with share recapture. Thanks to our improving service product. ARPU will be down to flat as we deal with pressure from softening coal pricing, lower fuel surcharge revenue and the eventual unwinding of accessorial revenues as supply chains unlock. ARPU will benefit from another strong year in core pricing gains. There are a lot of variables that are hard to predict in this uncertain environment. But in a flat revenue environment, it will be difficult to grow operating income in 2023. With the cost benefits from an improving service product being more than neutralized by inflation as well as the ARPU headwinds I just described. As you heard from Mark at Investor Day, we're expecting CapEx in to be roughly $2.1 billion for 2023. This is consistent with and supportive of the balanced and disciplined spending plan that Mark detailed in December. Despite the uncertainty, we entered 2023 with great confidence and momentum. When we look ahead, we see more than cyclical economic challenges in front of us. We see long-term macro trends that create opportunities for a franchise built for growth like Norfolk Southern. We have the right strategy, balancing service, productivity and growth. We have a strong and still improving service product. We have the right team of talented, dedicated railroads, and we are just getting started. We will now open the call to questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Tom Wadewitz : Yes. Great. Wanted to see if you could offer some more, I don't know, some more detail some additional perspective on the yields, revenue per car in intermodal and also in coal. I guess on intermodal, you sound pretty constructive, but -- just wondering if on domestic intermodal, you see some flow-through of potentially lower market pricing into what you get paid or whether you think your contracts protect you on that? And then I guess on coal, just a little more detail on the kind of how we ought to model things given some of the puts and takes. Alan Shaw : Tom, I'm going to turn it over to Ed and let him address your questions on our yield and RPU. Ed Elkins : You listen to some of our customers on their earnings calls, and you've heard their outlook, it's no doubt of the loose truck market right now. I'm not going to get into any individual contracts. But we see some, what I would call, green shoots out there in terms of bottoming perhaps in the spot market, it's reached what we think is a sustained bottom for the last few weeks. We've also seen a decrease in the total number of motor carriers that are licensed in the U.S. We think that's a very positive development sustained for the last 3 months. and export of used trucks is continuing to increase. So as we go forward, I think that we reached a point of stability and the market is going to rebalance, we feel okay about RPU going into -- and our opportunities for RPU going into '23 in the market space for truck. On the coal side, fourth quarter, we had a liquidated damage claim, which beefed up that RPU in the fourth quarter. Looking forward, as you can see the forward curves just as well we do, we're going to have a tough comp and a tough road ahead, particularly in the second quarter, in terms of comparisons. But there's still support out there for export met coal in the market, and we're going to handle more utility coal than we did last year. Tom Wadewitz : Can you ballpark the LD impact in 4Q? Just frame it a little bit for us. Ed Elkins : I think without the LD, you would have seen a slight downward RPU sequentially. Tom Wadewitz : Downward. Sequentially, okay. Great. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Jordan Alliger : I think you mentioned on the call at the end that the macro backdrop, it might be tough from a full year perspective to grow EBIT dollars. I'm just sort of curious, as you think about your big picture outlook. Is there a differential first half, second half? Do you expect EBIT growth to be possible at some point as we move through the year? Alan Shaw : There are, as you noted, a lot of uncertainties out there and some cross cuts. There's some tailwinds for us, but also we've got a number of headwinds and Ed just articulated a couple of those rate pressures. I'm going to let Mark talk a little bit about the cadence of what we're seeing through the year on revenue and expense. Mark George : Yes, really, it's going to depend a lot on the way the top line evolves. And if, in fact, there is a recession that we have to deal with, with some demand destruction. But as we think about -- we've got a lot of tailwinds in the year, including really strong core pricing that we anticipate as well as fuel efficiency. We had 3% fuel efficiency this year. We expect another good year next year. And I do expect that we'll have a wind down of some of the service-related costs now that our service product has improved. However, that would probably start to manifest more in the back half. And then, of course, we'll have the absence of some of the wage adjustment that we booked in the third quarter related to prior years. And this quarter, I would expect that big claims impact that we had in the fourth quarter was truly anomalous, and I wouldn't expect it to be of repeating nature at all. So those are some of the tailwinds as we look into the year. But we are swimming against some pretty heavy headwinds. As we talked about on the call, we do have meaningful inflation to absorb, including the wage increases. And we've got some level of diminishing coal RPU and accessorial revenues as we go through the year, again, mainly in the back half. And then the depreciation step-up that I mentioned, which will be more evenly spaced throughout the year. So -- but again, a lot of good tailwinds. We've got good core pricing and -- but the headwinds are kind of what I laid out. The biggest variable is really going to be volumes. So how much we get win. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Chris Wetherbee : Maybe I can pick up on that last comment. So in terms of the volume, I know you expect to be able to get some share recapture here. Do you think that ultimately yield a positive volume outcome for the year? And I guess, Mark have been helpful in terms of laying out the OR expectations, particularly a little bit more close in. So certainly, I would love to understand sort of your view on the potential for OR improvement or maybe holding the line in 2023. But if not, sort of first quarter, first half sort of how do we think about how things are trending out, just given some of the puts and takes you just outlined. Ed Elkins : I'll take a swing at it. This is Ed. We finally have our service back to a place where we were able to take on additional volume. And we're seeing the benefits of that improved service right now. So yes, I think we're going to be able to claw back some volume effect as I'm certain of it. The question I think that we're all trying to answer is, can we claw back enough to overcome the demand instruction that's present or might be present in the market in '23. I know I don't have to, but just to give you a flavor for what we look at -- you start with inflation, you go to interest rates and what that is doing to many markets, including housing, which is very important for our business. We've seen manufacturing inflect in the past 3 months to a negative there's a lot of uncertainty. The way I would describe our position is we are guarded, but we are poised for opportunity. We have the right service right now. We're building the capacity as soon as the opportunity manifests itself, we're going to be able to deliver. And when I think about what are the positives, the tailwinds for us, service recovery starts right there, which leads to network fluidity and capacity improvement, there's some chance that there might be a soft landing. There's a lot of people that think there could be. The customer that we talk to our customers, they're poised for growth, and they want to grow. They're investing for growth. And we're going to look at all those factors, and we'll be ready. Mark George : Yes. And Chris, we don't really want to get into quarterly guidance because there are a lot of variables. But I can just point you back to the tailwinds we talk of. Right now here in the first quarter, we're going to have probably a pretty good compare given where volumes were last year. So I think that's -- that will be -- that will probably represent one of our better year-over-year quarters, but we're really looking at a very uncertain outlook here in the second and third quarter. And we don't want to get into projecting right now at that level of granularity. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Amit Mehrotra : Mark, just a couple -- just quick follow-ups for me. So one, the flat operating income translates to EPS growth this year. I suppose you can still eke out some earnings growth under that scenario given maybe some share repurchase and then the other income kind of coming back. If you could just talk about that? And then totally get the uncertainty and it's one of the most uncertain that I've ever seen. But I wanted to ask you about what you can control, which is the OpEx base ex the fuel. So you mentioned the depreciation step up, you have some visibility on labor per the PEB or the agreement. I also think you said in the past, there's like $40 million a quarter of inefficiencies that you endured last year. So I assume that some of that can unwind. So So I'm just trying to understand how do you think the OpEx base ex fuel moves relative to that $6.4 billion that you did in 2022. So EPS growth relative to EBIT growth and then OpEx base ex-fuel expectations for '23? Mark George : Thanks, Amit. I think if you go back to our financial framework, we would expect that if we have kind of flattish earnings that EPS growth should exceed that and be positive, for sure. So that just fits right into the framework we talked about back in December at Investor Day. The $40 million ex -- sorry, the $40 million of service-related costs will start to unwind here. I mean, right now, we've got much improved service, although we are spending money to compensate for the fact that many of our locations are still below minimum staffing levels. So there is still a fair amount of overtime, recrews and incentives out there. But as the head count starts to increase in many of those core locations, I do expect toward the back half, especially that these costs will start to unwind from the $40 million per quarter significantly lower, like I said, more into the back half. And then we've got inflation in a lot of the other P&L line items, but we're working to mitigate a lot of those costs through more stringent control. I think equipment rents, as an example, that's one area where higher network speed, that should help us try to keep a lid on the growth on equipment rents. And even purchase services is an area where we've had a significant escalation due to the cost of service as well as inflation impacts. As inflation moderates, I do believe that, that will come under control as well. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Allison Poliniak : Just want to go back to the comment on labor and the crew basis. I know you said you were targeting stopping those at a minimum level. Any way to quantify is it sort of less than 10% of those at this point that you need to go? And then I guess with respect to that, staffing levels at the bases that are fully staffed, are you starting to look at maybe building incremental staff there to potentially capture any inflection as we go forward given the growth opportunities? Alan Shaw : Yes. Allison, we had talked about in the fourth quarter a number that was about 1/4 of our crew base is below minimum staffing levels. It's roughly in that neighbourhood right now. And frankly, as we move forward, it's going to be highly dependent upon where we see markets headed in overall demand. So we are continuing to hire into our environment or into that environment. Pardon me, our conductor training pipeline remains very robust. And certainly, you've seen the improvements in our service product as we've addressed both resources leadership and plan, and our service is now the best it's been in over 2 years. Paul, why don't you talk a little bit more specificity on what we're doing with respect to our craft colleagues. Paul Duncan : Yes, absolutely, Alan. As you stated, we remain on pace to continue and hit our hiring targets. And as Ed alluded to, we're going to continue to match that towards the forecast as we go. As we've come out of the contract negotiations, now it's a matter of focusing on what the future looks like as far as conductive redeployment, predictive work schedules as well as quality of life and those discussions are taking place as we speak. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens Inc. Justin Long : I wanted to see if you could give any additional color on the potential impact from assessorial fees winding down this year. And Mark, maybe compare the timing of that wind down to the timing of the moderation in the service-related costs that you talked about? I'm just trying to figure out what the net impact from that could be over the balance of this year. Ed Elkins : This is Ed. Thanks for the question. We look at this very carefully along with our customers and stakeholders. When we look globally, we see that the congestion at the ports that both coasts has really alleviated itself. And that's also true at most of our intermodal ramps on the inland side. But you look at good spending in the U.S., which has plateaued for the consumer, but it's plateaued at a level that essentially is where we should be in like 2025 or 2026. So there's still a tremendous number of goods being brought into the country, trying to fit through a pipeline that was designed for arguably 2023. And so that congestion still exists in some places, really around the warehousing on the Hinterland and Inland locations. We think it's going to unwind. In terms of the timing of that unwinding we're watching very carefully. We think it will happen in '23 at some point. Mark George : Yes, Justin, probably more like the back half, and it won't be necessarily precipitous the way we're assuming. But I would say it's roughly on par with kind of the timing we're thinking about the relief on service-related costs as well. Justin Long : That's helpful. And any color on the net impact from a dollar perspective. Mark George : No, no. Why don't you start getting out that far, the margin for OR is too big. Alan Shaw : I mean we'll lose asset [soil] revenue will gain in freight revenue because our customer supply chains will be more fluid, and we'll be able to move more business. Mark George : That's right. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Scott Group : I just want to make sure I'm understanding the guidance right. So it sounds like flattish revenue, not growing operating income, but not really declining a lot. So sort of flattish revenue, flattish operating income, flattish OR, plus or minus a little bit, but no big growth or declines. Is that ultimately what you guys are trying to say at this point? I just want to make sure I understand that. And then just 1 just thing I just want to clarify, where do you think head count goes from the January levels you gave us in the slides? Alan Shaw : Scott, this is Alan. Thanks for the question. Yes. Flattish is in the ballpark for revenue. I think Mark talked a little bit about some of the cross currents that we have, both on the top line and on the expense category. Can you repeat your second question? We had a break up quite a little bit in the middle. Yes, associated with headcount. Scott Group : Yes. Just where do we go from the January levels you have in the slides. Alan Shaw : Paul, why don't you talk about that? Paul Duncan : Yes. Scott, as of this morning, we're north of 7,500 T&E. And our target right now for May is to be in the 76-plus -- 7,600-plus range. And as stated earlier, we'll continue to adjust that target as we see the markets play out. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Brandon Oglenski : So I guess, Alan or Mark, I mean, we just had your Investor Day a month ago where you guys talked about resiliency, and I don't think anyone's faulting you here for a week macro. But is this the environment where you want to build in the resiliency into the network, maybe kind of piggybacking off that view on headcount. Is this where you add in capacity and really look to set up for growth potential in '24 and beyond? Alan Shaw : Yes. This is exactly what the environment we were contemplating. Here we are, we're continuing to hire. We're hiring aggressively. We need to because in some locations, as we talked about, were short of cruise. Resiliency is also about investing consistently in our assets, which includes our technology, it includes locomotives, track, intermodal terminals. It includes freight cars designed to help us compete with truck. And it includes -- yes, it includes our people as well. It also includes processes and a continuous improvement plan as we lift our service is the best it's been in over 2 years. But we're not stopping there. We're going to continue to evolve our product and we're going to continue to improve. And we're looking a couple of years out, how do we position ourselves so that our customers can compete and grow and we can compete and grow with them. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Shankar with Morgan Stanley. Ravi Shankar : Two-parter, if I may, please. You said that you expect share gains to offset some of the natural macro volume deterioration. Can you help us understand how much of that is \"in the bag\" with kind of new contract wins or kind of contracts have signed versus prospective as your service improves? And second question is, there has been some chatter on regulatory scrutiny on train length obviously, is a big part of top SPG and also for some of your peers. Can you talk about kind of how real that risk might be over time? Ed Elkins : Thank you, Ravi. For volume, we are going to -- we are producing a service that's allowing us to take back share that should be on Norfolk Southern. And that includes from the highway. And that's where we're really focused. It's how can we add value for our customers so that their top selection is Norfolk Southern. And over the past couple of years, our customers have to make difficult decisions. and we are helping them come back to the place where we can add the most value for them. And we're confident sure there's going to be lots of macro headwinds, but we're seeing it now, we can earn back some of that freight even in a down environment. Alan Shaw : Yes. Ravi, let me talk about the regulatory environment, if you will, for just a second. What we -- we're fully engaged with the STB. We've met with 4 of the 5 members just since our Investor Day on December 6. And they're really encouraged. What we told them as we spoke with them last year is we were fully committed to restoring service. They've seen that. They see it in the metrics and they hear it from our customers as well. And now, they're seeing us start to grow a little bit. And so we're aligned with them, and we're delivering on our promises for service and our promises to help our customers compete and grow. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Walter Spracklin : Just coming back on the trucking market, your long-term approach to gaining share against truck through higher service and just curious whether with the capacity, the slippery cap capacity and pricing environment that you're seeing right now and should that persist? Does that provide you with a significant challenge with regards to gaining market share given that price dynamic. And I know at least 2 of your competitors have started acquiring trucking companies, OR CN but H&R and TransX, and then Coaster Home, your TSX by quality. Is that something that you would envision doing as a way to offset some of that challenge by buying a trucking company and then converting it to rail? Is that something you'd consider? Just curious as to all that -- how that pertains to your [indiscernible] strategy? Alan Shaw : Walter, let me address the second question first, then I'll turn it over to Ed on how we compete with truck. Look, we got a franchise built for growth. And there are a lot of unique strengths about Norfolk Southern's franchise, the markets we serve and the customers with whom we are aligned. And so we are extremely confident and our ability to deliver organic growth. And we laid out that investment thesis in our Investor Day. And why don't you talk about how we're going to grow and compete with truck. Ed Elkins : Sure. Well, first of all, we have a fantastic partnership with our key customers. And that includes our key customers in that trucking space. I say all the time, we are not competing against trucks. We're competing against the highway. Truckers are our customers. and that's a great place to be. Sure, the current environment is challenging, but we've been there before. We've seen these cycles play out time and time again. The market is rebalancing right now. And I think when you look out past '23, it's clear that rail intermodal, specifically on Norfolk Southern is going to be a very compelling place to be for customers. We talk all the time internally about the -- all the innovation that's going into reducing the carbon footprint for transportation But if you want to reduce your carbon footprint by about 70% to 90%, just put it on a train on Norfolk Southern. It's the easiest way to do it. So we think the value prop long term is compelling. And even in the short term, we think we are very well positioned to compete with our customers. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Jon Chappell : Thank circling back to yield a little bit. I mean the identifiable headwinds of fuel and accessory unwinds are very clear. It sounds like you think the core can still offset a lot of that, which has been really Norfolk's bread and butter for the last several years. But in this loosening truckload market, weaker economic backdrop, are you finding that there's any areas where your pricing power it's coming under pressure a little bit due to customers' unwillingness especially in the loosening truckload market as we think to intermodal. Ed Elkins : I think what makes me optimistic about our ability to continue to price in the same way that we have for years and years is the increasing value of the service that we're providing. Right now, we're producing a service that is very valuable to our customers we're supplying capacity that allows them to move that freight from the highway back to the railroad. And you know what, we're going to continue to develop and enhance that value just like just like Alan talked about. We're not stopping in terms of understanding what our customers need and what sort of service will provide value to them. We're really looking at the 3-, 5-, 7-year horizon on how we can deliver value for our customers, that's how we're going to continue to produce the results that we have so far, and we're confident in that. Jon Chappell : So does that mean core is a little bit stickier than in intermodal since there's more little conversion potential there as opposed to maybe economically sensitive merchandise? Ed Elkins : You're breaking up just a hair. Can you repeat that? Jon Chappell : Yes, so does that mean that core is maybe a bit stickier in intermodal, given the potential for share gain as opposed to more economically sensitive merchandise? Ed Elkins : I don't know. I think when I look across the markets that we serve, I think we've got potential to continue to produce -- leaving coal out of this for the time being because of the year-over-year headwind -- we've got a great track record. We're going to continue to do that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Brian Ossenbeck : One for Mark. Can you just give us a little bit of color on the average comp per employee going forward. Obviously, this quarter, you got the accrual, the incentive comp tailwind. You probably got some mix of new hires still in there. So any color you can provide on the OpEx side when we look at that throughout the rest of 2023 would be helpful. And then for Paul, I know we're talking a lot about grounded conductors in the headlines, and this is a big thing that's starting in the industry. But maybe you can just level set the time line that you think this could progress to the extent you can offer one because it does seem like it's a new event, but we'll obviously, I think, at least take quite a bit of time for this to really get past pilot program and implementation to be more meaningful that we might see something live and in the field? Mark George : I'll start with the comp and ben per employee. Brian, we ended pretty much where we had signaled we'd be on a per employee basis, excluding the adjustment there that deflated it a little bit. I would expect in '23, you'll see that number step up in Q1, like we talked about due to the payroll tax resets, and it will probably be in that 35 and change range. And while it would normally step up again in Q3 due to the wage accrual or the wage increases that take effect there in the third quarter. That will probably get offset to a large degree by the unwinding of some of these service-related costs. So I would expect kind of flat in that 35,000 and change territory throughout the year. Paul Duncan : Yes. And just adding to the second question on that. As we stated, national bargaining was complete here in December. We've already begun negotiations with our labor unions on conductor redeployment. From the fact of the time line we're in negotiations, but there's certainly a regulatory piece of this. But as we have the discussions and we think about the long-term future of where we want to be, there are benefits from a predictive work standpoint. There are certainly benefits from a work-life balance and quality of life standpoint that have been challenges in the industry for a number of years that we feel get addressed through some level of conductor redeployment. So we think there's a compelling reason certainly for the industry and the regulations to move forward in support of conductor redeployment. And certainly, back to what Ed was talking about. We have to continue to find through our balanced approach of service productivity and growth those next opportunities to drive greater value for our customers and bring that volume on our railroad. So we think that's all a part of our value proposition in the long term. Brian Ossenbeck : And do you think you could see a pilot program for one of those initiatives starting this year? Or is that a little too soon to expect? Mark George : It's too soon to say at this point. we're ongoing negotiations. We want to have those discussions first and cross that bridge when it comes. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Cherilyn Radbourne : I was hoping you could speak to the kind of visibility that you have in automotive for 2023? And how far out you think that goes? And perhaps looking at a little further, you could also comment on any changes that you anticipate in that franchise as far as routing, et cetera, as the industry converts to electric vehicles? Mark George : Sure. There's clearly a bow wave of unmet demand out there for automobiles in North America. And the industry is really focused on delivering and trying to work that off. We are, too. We've invested in new cars for that fleet, and our fluidity has improved significantly. We are continuing to refine that. That's going to offer us the opportunity to help our automotive customers meet some of that unmet demand. Going forward, I think it takes a while to work that off. I don't know that it ends this year. Turning to the question. I think your question was about EVs and future supply chains. We've seen a tremendous amount of investment in new capability for whether it's EVs, construction, whether it's battery construction, whether it's battery recycling, there's a tremendous amount of interest out there and some investment going forward that we are working to make sure that we can support. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ariel Rosa with Credit Suisse. Ariel Rosa : So I wanted to ask about the state of labor relations as you see it. To what extent has it moved -- or has it improved since moving past the PEB? Obviously, negotiations had gone a little bit contentious, but wanted to hear your perspective on if that's improved since then? And then to what extent do you think you might have to make further concessions on benefits or sick leaves or anything around that sort of thing? And then given the benefits you're describing around kind of the flywheel effect and the service improvements that you're seeing, I'm wondering if volumes do come in a little bit weaker than expected for this year, given the aggressive hiring, what do you do with those excess employees? Or do you see yourself in an environment where maybe you have a little bit more head count than what's needed and what do you do with those employees? Alan Shaw : I'll address part of that and then turn it over to Paul. Now that we're done with national negotiations, we can turn to local negotiations in which we are collaborating with our craft colleagues to modernize our labor agreements to improve their quality of life, enhance operational flexibility and provide more predictable work schedules. That benefits us, that benefits our craft colleagues and benefits employee engagement. And we're seeing that as we get out into the field and talk to our employees about the future of Norfolk Southern, a balanced approach on service, productivity and growth. In respect to what would happen were we to enter into a downturn, that is factored into our thinking. And it certainly provides an opportunity for enhanced training and enhanced flexibility for our employees. Paul, do you want to talk a little bit about what you're seeing out in the field? Paul Duncan : Yes, Alan, I mean, you touched very well on the very first level the lever would certainly be investing in our workforce, cross qualification, extended training board consolidations, et cetera, where we have opportunities there. But we also have the lever of attrition. And we've seen what has taken place in the industry with furloughs, we just have not seen for those come back. It's very expensive in the long term, and we do not see that as certainly one, if any lever that we want to pull. We want to ensure, again, if there is a volume downturn, we are in a position as that volume comes back to handle it and handle it well. So that is how we are going to approach a downturn in potential volume. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Bascome Majors : If you look at the senior management incentives, they've recently been very much in the short term tied to OR and operating income with the long term tied to returns on capital with the TSR multiplier. At the Investor Day a few weeks ago, Andy Adam said that she was working with the Board to really redo the incentives both for senior management and for some other employees subject to the incentive program to really align with this new strategy that you guys laid out for us a few weeks back. Can you talk a little more about the changes that are being made and what you're doing at the compensation structure level to really encourage the behavior you're looking for in the long-term strategy? Alan Shaw : Bascome, thanks for the question. We are, as Andy noted, we're in discussions with our Board to make sure that our compensation plan is aligned with our strategic goals. We've always done that, right? And as we noted at Investor Day, our strategic goal is to deliver top-tier revenue and earnings growth through industry competitive margins and a balanced capital deployment. Mark George : And I think you'll end up seeing in '23 that the structure has been amended a bit to reflect the alignment with our strategy. Bascome Majors : Can you talk a little more specifically about those changes? Mark George : Not right now, we can't. No. still in discussion with the [indiscernible]. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research Partners. Jeff Kauffman : There were a lot of odd issues that occurred this year, and I think you hit some of them in terms of accessorials and in terms of liquidated damages. I'm kind of curious, with the big shift that we saw with West Coast to East Coast shipments from customers and now we're dealing with this inventory overhang. How do you think that affected our business in the Eastern U.S. Is it better for you if these containers dock in the west and get handed over in Chicago? And do your customers see a return to the West Coast at some point this year, maybe when labor situation settles? Is my understanding is it still tends to be a little cheaper to dock West than East. Just kind of curious how you thought that, that shift that's probably a little more transient impacted your business? Ed Elkins : This is Ed. Thank you for the question. I love talking about the business. The shift from West Coast to East Coast has been ongoing for the better part of 20 years. And that evolution has occurred because of economics over time as manufacturing has shifted south and west from Japan to Korea to China and now towards Vietnam and Myanmar, et cetera. it makes those all-water sailings more attractive. When you look at the population center of the U.S., which is East of Mississippi. The expansion of the Panama Canal and now the use of Suez is also a compelling reason why those economics tend to work more. Our position is pretty simple. We want to be able to handle those shipments effectively, whether they come in through the West Coast, [indiscernible] quite a few to will or whether it comes through the East Coast. There's no doubt that there is a lot of inland infrastructure associated with transloading on the West Coast that makes that compelling. And we're perfectly positioned to help our customers deliver that volume to the population centers in the east. At the same time, we've invested a lot of money to make sure that we're a compelling partner for our ports and for our steamship lines as they come through the East Coast. We've invested a lot of money in some of our largest lanes are those shorter lengths of all that emanate from whether it's Savanna, Charles or Norfolk or from New York, et cetera, that allow us to add value to those shipments. Jeff Kauffman : And just to follow up to that. What are your customers telling you in terms of their plans on inventory reduction where you may see more normalized shipment levels? Ed Elkins : I think the outlook from our customers is that there's been a work down in inventory recently after that run-up. I think many of their customers are now getting their inventories in much better shape. And it really comes down to having the right product, not necessarily the right number of any given product, but the right type. And so we're encouraged by those recent work downs. And as we move into '23, again, guarded in terms of economic outlook, but poised for opportunity as soon as they manifest themselves. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. David Vernon : So one sort of detailed question and then I had a question for you, Ed, on sort of rail share. So just to start off, if you think about the starting off point for flattish EBIT guidance, can you just let us help us understand is that from a GAAP basis or adjusting for some of the accruals? And then as you think about the last couple of quarters, have noticed the carload traffic, particularly chemicals in ag, you guys have been outperforming CSX. And I'd love to get your perspective on how important sort of rail share is to you and the growth strategy going forward. CSX has historically had a little bit bigger carload footprint. I think that you guys have had as you've been investing a lot in intermodal over the last decade. How do you think about that sheer situation playing out, right? Are you guys outgrowing them because of some specific network advantages? Are you winning them in the marketplace? Any thoughts on that would be really helpful. Mark George : Yes, real quick, David. I mean we're talking on a GAAP basis and -- go ahead, Ed. Ed Elkins : Sure. Yes. The market that we really study is that $860 billion truck and logistics market. There's 5 trillion-ton miles moving in North America. And majority of those move adverse to railroads. We -- that's where I'm focused is how do we convert that business -- more of that business to Norfolk Southern. Railroads are, in some ways, defined by geography, but we are defined by our customer base, and that's what we're focused on. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, our last question today comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Ken Hoexter : Great. So just a follow up -- a couple of clarifications. On staffing, are you saying you're only 100 off your T&E target, and that's your goal there? And then I guess, the total employees, you ended with about 19,250, up about 1,200 from a year ago. Maybe give your thoughts on where that is a year from now. And then maybe -- I don't know, Mark, can you talk about what service level costs are still embedded in there, given the service gains versus inflation? I'm just trying to figure out where the opportunity is? Alan Shaw : Ken, for now, based on the economic outlook of 7,600 target that we had still exists. We're going to continue to hire in locations where we're tight And going forward, as you look here into 2024, obviously, there's a lot of uncertainty out there. we've talked about that. And so I don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves. I will tell you that right now, the conductor training pipeline is elevated, but it will remain so until we get to target and feel like we're recruiting, hiring and training at a steady state. Mark George : And certainly, volume growth profile will mean that, that number is constantly moving. The target headcount number is constantly moving. And Specific to your question on where the service costs reside, Ken, I'd say roughly half of those sit in comp and ben between overtime, recrews, incentive expenses, as well as recruiting and training. That's really where, I'd say, half of it said. There's also a fair amount in purchased services. A lot of the disruption cost sits there. And there's also a little bit sitting in materials as well with regard to locomotives. So it's battered throughout the rest of the P&L, but half of it sits in component. Ken Hoexter : And is there a total dollar amount that you're pointing to that you're looking to offset with the inflation? Paul Duncan : Well, what we indicated was it's roughly $40 million a quarter that we're dealing with. And I would expect that, that number to come back down closer to, but not all the way to 0, by the time you get to the end of the year. So that's it. Ken Hoexter : Great. And then just a follow-up for me, if I can. Paul, you noted 202 locomotive miles per day. Can you talk about targets there, given the service improvements where you think we end the year with? Paul Duncan : We are just now beginning to get the service back to where we wanted it to be here within the past several weeks and if not the past couple of months. So we described at Investor Day the flywheel effect that is going to take place, fully expect as we continue to resource up to the group piece that we spoke to and the service gains that we have made that we're going to continue to see that improve throughout the year. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Alan Shaw for any final comments. Alan Shaw : I'd like to thank everyone for their interest in Norfolk Southern and for joining us today. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Luke Nichols, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Nichols. You may begin. Luke Nichols : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Please note that during today's call, we will make certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to future events or future performance of Norfolk Southern Corporation, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and may differ materially from actual results. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full disclosure of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. Our presentation slides are available at nscorp.com in the Investors section, along with a reconciliation of any non-GAAP measures used today to the comparable GAAP measures. Turning to Slide 3. It's now my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's President and Chief Executive Officer, Alan Shaw. Alan Shaw : Good morning, and thank you for joining our first quarter earnings call. I will begin with an update on East Palestine and our ongoing focus on safe operations. From the beginning, we have been guided by one principle. We are going to do whatever it takes to make it right for East Palestine and the surrounding areas. We are claiming the site safely, thoroughly and with urgency. We are assisting families supporting local businesses and non-profits and investing in long-term projects for the area's future prosperity. I went to East Palestine in the immediate aftermath of the derailment and have returned almost every week to meet with members of the community and monitor our work. I've been in churches, schools, meeting halls, businesses and living rooms, asking how Norfolk Southern can use our resources to help the community recover and thrive. I'm proud of our people and our progress. I'm also proud of the crew and the locomotive that night. According to the National Transportation Safety Board's preliminary report, they were operating the train properly and took the right actions after receiving the alarm, the wayside detectors work, and there were no track defects. As the NTSB continues its work, we have already begun to take actions designed to further enhance safety, such as installing additional safety sensors, accelerating the deployment of advanced early detection technologies and increasing safety training for first responders. The firefighters and other emergency responders who ran to the scene that night in East Palestine have our deepest gratitude and respect. They are heroes. We also appreciate the leadership of local, state, and federal officials and agencies in response to these events. We share their goals of helping people affected by the derailment and finding evidence-based approaches to rail safety. We are a safe railroad. In 2022, Norfolk Southern had fewer derailments than any other year in the last two decades, and our rate of employee in injuries was the lowest in a decade. We strive to do better. While events of the last few months have focused national attention on rail safety, the remits at Norfolk Southern in the first quarter declined from the same period last year, continuing a trend of improvement. We are going to learn from this accident to become an even safer company. I have been personally engaged in Washington to support specific federal legislative provisions to enhance safety. As the initial learnings from East Palestine have made clear, meaningful enhancements will require the combined efforts of the entire industry, railcar owners, leasing companies, equipment manufacturers and the railroad companies. Norfolk Southern intends to be a leader in that effort, and we embrace that role. Turning to Slide 4. At our Investor Day last December, we chartered a new course for sustainable long-term value creation. We were the first railroad to launch a strategy that starts with safe, reliable, and resilience service for our customers. Balance with smart sustainable growth and productivity improvements. With everything we do, we will focus on long-term priorities and value rather than just the short-term. I'm reaffirming my commitment to that vision and building the team to drive that strategy. This new direction is even more important today, and we have been working to execute our industry-leading strategy. Our customer-centric operations-driven approach supports both service and safety and will enable us to grow with our customers sustainably for the long-term. Our powerful network, desirable geographic footprint, best-in-class channel partners and strong relationships with our valued customers, uniquely position Norfolk Southern to deliver on our strategy. When we spoke in January, service was the best in two years, customers were noticing and December volumes were at 52 weeks highs, define typical seasonality. Consistent with the long-term vision, after the East Palestine and Springfield derailments, we made two decisions. We knew would have a near-term impact on service, capacity, and revenue. First, we are pulling up the tracks at the derailment site in East Palestine and removing the impact of soil in response to feedback from the community and the EPA. Since March 3rd, we have had only one track at a time in service with trains running at restricted speed through this section of our busiest quarter. This mainline segment links Chicago to Eastern Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York, and there's a strength of our franchise. We anticipate completing the remediation in having both tracks of service by early June. Second, out of an abundance of caution, in early March, we accelerated the analysis of train makeup rules as part of our broader efforts to improve safety, service, and productivity, which we began implementing soon thereafter. As a result of these purposeful actions on our part, train capacity was limited initially. Paul will address this in greater detail. We are restoring capacity as we dial in this new set of processes. We do not anticipate any meaningful long-term impacts on service, capacity or cost structure. These were the right things to do. They were also the best decisions to enhance our ability to deliver on our long-term strategy of delivering resilient service. It will take some time to build resiliency, and we're making progress. We continue to invest to ensure we have the right team and resources where they are needed to provide our customers with safe best-in-class service. As we shared when we announced our new strategy last December, we aren't focused on managing short-term OR with actions that will undermine our longer-term goals. We strive for more. Our longer-term commitment to competitive margins will be balanced with other important financial measures such as growth in revenue, EPS, and ROIC. Putting that plan into action, we are making strategic investments in the near-term that position us to deliver long-term value. One of those investments is to maintain the people and resources we need through economic downturns. This will allow us to respond more quickly and capture revenue growth when markets recover. Even more significant, resilient service enables our customers to confidently build rail into their supply chains and supports highway to rail conversions. We will use temporary downturns to invest in training, creating career opportunities for the craft railroaders who are the heart and soul of Norfolk Southern. I enjoy the time I spend in crew rooms and have made it my personal goal to listen to my craft colleagues about what they need. I won't stop working until our service and safety culture is the acknowledged model for the industry. Our strategy is a better way forward for the industry. It's a better way to deliver value to shareholders, and it's the right thing to do for our employees, our customers, and the communities we serve. Before I turn it over to Mark, I'd like to take a moment and recognize our customers who have shown a tremendous amount of support throughout the challenges of the first quarter. I've received countless calls, letters, and e-mails from customers recognizing Norfolk Southern's positive response and dedication to making it right. It's made me proud to be part of the Norfolk Southern team and truly demonstrates the deep partnerships we have forged with our customers. I'll now turn it over to Mark. Mark George : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. On Page 6, you will see our key financial results for the quarter. The top row represents the GAAP measures. On the second row are the current cost estimates and impacts related to the Eastern Ohio incident and response. On the third row, you see the adjusted results. The $387 million of expense that we recorded for the incident includes costs associated with the cleanup of the site, community support and restoration payments, legal and advisory expenses, and a preliminary estimate of claims and settlements. It is important to note that no insurance or other recoveries are assumed in these estimates and that credits associated with these recoveries will be determined and recorded in future periods. Similarly, as we learn more, one can expect future estimates of cost will result in revisions to the accruals in subsequent quarters. The two rows at the bottom reflect the variances versus Q1 of 2022. GAAP earnings were down year-over-year due to the Eastern Ohio cost that were recorded. The adjusted variances at the bottom reflects 7% revenue growth that Ed will detail shortly, along with adjusted net income growth of 8% and adjusted EPS growth of 13%. Adjusted operating expense were up 11% in the quarter, and Slide 7 details the drivers, which I will walk through now. Adjusted operating expenses were up $204 million or 11%, with the majority of the increase being driven by inflation and incremental service-related costs. Inflationary pressures are visible in pretty much all P&L categories, most notably in comp and bend from last year's wage settlements. In comp and bend, we also saw an increase in headcount as we continue to build our T&E resources to help us become more reliable and resilient in support of our long-term strategy for growth. Purchase service growth is also impacted by inflation, but is also driven in part by technology investments, including projects aimed at improving productivity, operational executability, and enhanced safety. The service disruptions triggered by the Eastern Ohio derailment, the associated shutdown of our main line in a critical corridor as well as the acceleration of our enhanced train makeup rules is having an incremental impact on costs, resulting in slower network speeds that inflates equipment rents, while also driving a meaningful increase in material costs, in part because we strategically work to bring locomotives into service from our stored fleet to help accelerate our network. Moving to depreciation, please recall that we gave guidance on depreciation headwind this year from a recently completed roadway depreciation study, and that contributed $8 million of headwind in the quarter, and that will continue as a headwind in subsequent quarters. We also drove fuel efficiency by another 1% improvement in the quarter versus last year. Moving to the P&L results below operating income on Slide 8, and I'll talk to the adjusted variances here in the right-hand columns. Operating income grew 1%. Other income was $56 million, aided by favorable returns on company-owned life insurance and that helped adjusted pretax income grow 7%. Net income grew 8% and EPS grew 13% in the quarter. Turning to free cash flow and shareholder distributions on Slide 9. Cash from operations was $179 million higher, in part from changes in working capital, while free cash flow was $140 million higher than last year, and we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders with a strong dividend, supplemented by share repurchases. Let me turn now to Paul for his review on operations. Paul Duncan : Thank you, Mark. I'll begin on Slide 11. On my first earnings call as Chief Operating Officer this January, I shared my intention to begin every update with safety. This reflects the priority we put on the topic. Everything we do starts with safety. At the time, my leadership team and I were in the middle of kickoff meetings with operations leaders across our network. Alan joined us for some of those meetings. Our marketing leadership team participated in others. We started every meeting with safety discussing that it is an enterprise priority. We are investing in our leadership this year with all of our ballast line supervisors in starting every conversation with safety. As leaders, we set the tone and tone influences culture. We are also investing in the development of community responders, including a new regional training facility in Bellevue, Ohio. We are a safe railroad and constantly challenge ourselves to do even better. We will continue to work with our employees and community partners on safety-related initiatives that further enhance our culture in these areas. I'll note specific steps we are taking to enhance safety after reviewing the NTSB's preliminary report on the East Palestine derailment, including adding 200 more hot bearing detectors onto our network, expanding our network of acoustic bearing detectors and accelerating the deployment of digital train inspection portals, our most advanced safety technology, which we described in greater detail during our Investor Day. On Slide 12, you will see our safety metrics. As Alan noted, in 2022, Norfolk Southern had the lowest rate of employee injuries in a decade with a 1.01 frequency ratio. We began 2023 with a 0.89 injury frequency ratio and continue to work so all of our colleagues go home to their families in the same condition they arrive. We are also making strides to reduce our FRA accident rate. We are showing one additional graph this quarter, reflecting the frequency of accidents that occur on mainline tracks. While we strive to reduce all accidents, mainline accidents tend to have greater impact to the communities that we serve. These have generally been flat with year-over-year improvement through Q1 compared to Q1 2022. Our investment in infrastructure is paying off, and we're confident our focus on equipment inspection technology will continue to drive our mainline accident rate lower. Turning to Slide 13, I'll provide an update on our overall service. In the first quarter, we accelerated the analysis of train makeup rules as part of our broader efforts to improve safety, service and productivity. We began implementing enhancements soon thereafter, resulting in a significant short-term impact on velocity and the performance of our railroad. However, these changes were the right thing to do and have increased the reliability of our network and also allowed us to become even more productive. For example, we are now operating 50% more Merchandise trains with distributed power than this same time last year. This was only possible things to our continuing commitment to locomotive modernization, another example of how we are investing in long-term value. As Alan explained, we also made the decision to pull up the two mainline tracks at the derailment site and remove all impacted soil. From March 3rd, until the remediation is complete, currently expected in early June, we are only operating one track at reduced speeds through that section of our busy Premier Corridor. We have everything we need to recover from this temporary setback to our momentum. Remember that prior to the derailment, our service was the best it had been in two years. As we dial in our train makeup enhancements, we are already seeing improvements to our network in recent weeks. We will continue to work through the backlog and do not expect any meaningful long-term impacts. We are eager to get back to the execution of our service-oriented strategy. Transitioning to Slide 14. As we invest in the people and resources we need to execute our strategy and become more resilient, we still have about one-third of our high-end locations below our minimum staffing target based on anticipated demand. We continue to hire at a strong pace and have a robust pipeline of trainees in place. We are employing incentives to attract candidates in targeted locations, and we are taking a series of steps to provide immediate support where it is needed. For example, we are leveraging our go teams and temporary transfers in critical areas as we continue to restore the network. Moving to Slide 15 for our productivity update. Starting with locomotives, we maintained progress in the quarter on keeping locomotive velocity well above last year's levels. The overall Train & Engine workforce productivity metric remains below last year due to the elevated pipeline of conductor trainees as well as maintaining capacity in support of service and future growth. As we have discussed, an essential aspect of our balanced strategy for service, productivity and growth is to provide resilient service through economic downturns and times of volume uncertainty. This represents a deliberate strategic investment to maintain capacity in support of service and future growth. Lastly, our modernized locomotive fleet and fuel efficiency initiatives produced another quarter of record fuel productivity. This is another area where we will continue to invest to drive benefits for our shareholders, customers, and the communities we serve. I'll now turn it over to Ed Elkins. Claude Elkins : Thanks, Paul, and good morning to everyone on the call. I'm starting on Slide 17, where our results for the quarter speak to the benefits of our diverse portfolio in that we were able to leverage strong market conditions in our Merchandise and Coal markets to offset weaker conditions in our Intermodal markets. This enabled year-over-year growth in revenue and revenue per unit in the first quarter. As you can see, overall volume was flat, but total revenue increased 7% to $3.1 billion due to higher fuel surcharges and positive mix, which more than offset lower volume in storage revenue in Intermodal. Volume and revenue were strongest in January when our service product was the best it has been in two years, and the truck market was showing signs of rebalancing. Volume and revenue decelerated throughout the quarter as service disruptions impacted our ability to meet customer demand in key markets and the truck market continued to deteriorate. Our performance in January demonstrates that a customer-centric operations-driven approach can yield significant value for our customers and our shareholders. Within Merchandise, volume growth of 5% was led by strength in sand, automotive, grain and aggregates markets. These gains were partially offset by weakness in demand for plastics and for pulp board. Volume improvement was the largest driver of double-digit revenue growth in Merchandise this quarter, followed by higher fuel prices and price gains. Intermodal markets were notably weaker this quarter, particularly within our domestic lines of business where a weak freight environment and a weakening truck sector combined to drive a 4% volume decline year-over-year. International Intermodal was a bright spot this quarter with volumes improving 9% year-over-year on higher demand for IPI services, even as overall imports fell, which helped to mitigate some of the domestic declines. Intermodal revenue benefited from higher fuel surcharges and price this quarter. However, not enough to overcome the negative impacts of lower storage revenue and lower domestic volume, which drove a 5% decline in revenue versus the prior period. Now I'd note that the combination of improving international IPI volumes and declining Intermodal storage revenue is a strong indication that supply chain congestion is rapidly unwinding in the U.S. Coal shipments in the first quarter were up 5% year-over-year, led by export, which is currently experiencing continued high levels of demand as well as greater Coal supply in our service territory to meet that demand. Volume growth was muted somewhat by year-over-year declines in utility Coal due to depressed natural gas prices and mild winter weather. Coal revenue was up 13% in the first quarter, driven by higher volumes, fuel surcharge, and price gains. Now moving to Slide 18. As we look ahead to the remainder of 2023, we expect near-term headwinds to pressure volume and revenue throughout the second quarter. However, we are optimistic that our service product will be much improved in the back half of the year, positioning us to return to growth when market conditions permit. Additionally, we are walking on to the field today with the best marketing team in the business. And this team is working hard to identify new avenues to growth in the form of new markets to serve and new products to deliver. Even in a decelerating economy, we know that we can offer exceptional value to customers seeking to reduce their overall spend on transportation and reduce their carbon footprint. As we look at the rest of the year, Merchandise growth will be led by automotive shipments, supported by the forecasted 5% growth in U.S. light vehicle production for the remaining quarters of 2023. Also contributing to growth in automotive shipments is a backlog of shippable ground counts that we will work through as our service improves. We also expect strong volume improvement in our metals market where improved equipment cycle times will enable us to serve unmet demand. Partially offsetting expected growth will be weakness in our chemicals markets where certain segments, like plastics, are experiencing weaker demand. Facility downtime and increased pipeline capacity will also drive year-over-year declines in shipments of crude oil and natural gas liquids. Within our Intermodal markets, volume in 2023 will be largely dependent on economic conditions, particularly the health of the American consumer. Currently, we see headwinds from excess truck capacity, replenished inventories, and a challenging consumer economy, and these headwinds are likely to persist throughout the second quarter, negatively impacting volume, particularly in our domestic lines of business. Looking at the back half of '23, clearly, the economic conditions remain uncertain. We see continued weakness in the housing market, which negatively impacts demand for furniture, home appliances, electronics, all those things that want to move in a container. That market has not rebalanced as we anticipated earlier this year with spot and contract truck rates continuing to fall throughout the first quarter. So the timing of the rebalancing will have a large impact on our volume outlook. Additionally, our domestic partners outlook for the second half of '23 has dimmed somewhat. International Intermodal shipments will be driven by demand for IPI, which is a function of import volumes, which is declining and supply chain fluidity, which is improving. Fluidity has returned to supply chains faster than we expected, which will be a tailwind to volumes, but will negatively impact Intermodal storage revenue for the remainder of this year. Taken together, we are optimistic for our Intermodal business to overcome these near-term challenges and to finish the year with momentum to realize the long-term potential of this market. We have the best Intermodal partners in the industry. and our team is working hard to ensure that we are positioned for success with them as the market turns. Lastly, volume in our Coal business for the remainder of '23 will be up versus '22 with growth in export Coal shipments more than offsetting expected declines in utility Coal. Strength in export Coal markets will be driven by new Coal production coming online at NS-served mines and sustained international demand for U.S. sourced Coal. However, the expected increase in volume will be more than offset by anticipated lower revenue per unit due to lower seaborne Coal prices and reduced fuel surcharge revenue. The utility outlook is highly dependent upon weather and natural gas pricing, which is currently expected to average less than $3 per million BTU in '23, a more than 50% decrease from last year. In addition, stockpiles are currently at increased levels, which further pressures demand for utility Coal shipments. Overall, we have a cautious outlook for the remainder of '23. Improving service levels will be a tailwind, but persistent market headwinds and a stubbornly loose truck market will temper our ability to grow in the near-term. Overall, growth in 2023 will be dependent on the macro environment. We continue to put our efforts on things that we can control to deliver on our customer-centric operations-driven strategy. We are making the investments required to deliver compelling logistics value for the long-term through a simple, reliable, and efficient customer experience. Lastly, on Slide 19, I'd like to highlight a recent industrial development success that demonstrates the long-term value of locating along Norfolk Southern lines. Scout Motors, an independent U.S. company backed by Volkswagen Group is locating a new manufacturing plant in Blythewood, South Carolina and a site served by Norfolk Southern. In Phase 1, this new plant will produce more than 200,000 new electric vehicles and create over 4,000 permanent jobs. The $2 billion investment by Scout will revive an iconic brand that last produced vehicles in 1980, and we couldn't be happier that Scout selected a site served by Norfolk Southern. We look forward to serving their business by the end of 2026. Before I close, I'd like to say thank you to our customers who have supported us through the challenges of this first quarter. We appreciate every opportunity that they give us to participate in their supply chains, and we look forward to successfully growing these partnerships. We are confident in our ability to realize long-term growth and we look forward to delivering results for our customers and for our shareholders. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Alan to bring us home. Alan Shaw : Thanks, Ed. This week marks the end of my first year as CEO. As I reflect on the year more broadly and especially the last few months, I appreciate that adversity reveals character. That's true for people, and it's true for organizations. I'm inspired by my colleagues at Norfolk Southern, who are rising to the challenge of doing the right thing. We are anchored by our values and driven by our responsibility to safely deliver the goods and materials that move the U.S. economy. Moving forward, Norfolk Southern will be known for safe operations and for delivering service, productivity, and growth through our pioneering new strategy. Our response in East Palestine will be a source of pride for years to come, and we will be a stronger company, setting the pace for our industry. Whether it's our commitment to the citizens of East Palestine, our employees, our customers, or to all the communities in which we operate every day. When we do the next right thing, we deliver long-term value creation for our shareholders. We will now open the call to questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed. Ken Hoexter : Great. Good morning. Thanks for the rundown there. Just maybe Alan or Ed, you talked about rebounding service levels, yet volumes are down 8% quarter-to-date, much worse than the flat in the first quarter. Maybe you could talk a little bit about the timing from when you get back to that normal seed through this quarter? And then you mentioned you're still about a third of the target levels or below the target level of your T&E targets in some regions. Third seems awfully big, given the focus you've had on hiring people. Maybe talk about the sustained cost impact and the ability to get there? Thanks. Alan Shaw : Hey, Ken, thanks for the question. Yes, we're in the process of recovering service. And I want to make it really clear. We had a great service product to the close last year and in January. And you saw the attendant impact on our volumes, right? It proves that our unique vision, our unique focus and our unique strategy works in this industry. And we remain committed to executing on that. In the aftermath of East Palestine, we had some tough decisions to make. And we made those decisions knowing full well that it would have a near-term impact on our service and our productivity and our growth, but they were the right decisions to make, because they align with our core values, and they are long aligned with our long-term focus as a customer-centric operations-driven service organization. The same operating team and the same marketing team that delivered that exceptional service product late last year and beginning of this year is in place now. And we're in much better shape with our resources. And so I don't think the climb out will be nearly as long. Certainly, we want to get the track back in place in East Palestine. And that, as Paul noted, will probably happen in the beginning of June. And so I think as we move into and through the third quarter, you're going to see us in a position to deliver that exceptional service product that customers have become accustomed to receiving from Norfolk Southern. Ed, do you want to talk about what you're hearing from customers on that? Claude Elkins : Sure. And I appreciate the question. really, it's a story of a couple of different markets. We've been very fortunate, frankly, that we've been able to preserve a large amount of fluidity in our Intermodal network. We think that's really important as we move forward here as we work off this excess inventory because bid season is happening right now, and we will see our customers come through this with some very strong performance later on the year. So we're banking on the come, so to speak, in terms of our customers' performance on the Intermodal side. The consumer market is clearly still deteriorating. And you've heard that elsewhere, you read it in the Wall Street Journal. On the industrial side, there's still lots of demand out there for us to meet with additional capacity as we improve our service. And we're bullish on that front. Operator : Our next question is from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. Amit, please check and see if your line is muted. Okay. We will come back to him. Our next question will be from Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed. Chris Wetherbee : Thanks good morning. There's two comments that you made in the prepared remarks that I wanted to just maybe see if we can get a little bit more color on. Alan, you talked about, I think, over the long run, no long-term impacts from the derailment on service capacity or cost structure. So really wanted to sort of explore that cost structure dynamic and maybe how you're thinking about that? And then Mark, you talked a little bit about the potential, I think, for future estimates of cost that could result in accruals. I think that's obviously a very important dynamic as we're thinking about the long-term impact as the derailment. So if we could just sort of think about the longer-term outlook and what it might mean from a cost perspective going forward, so we can get an idea of sort of what the run rate earnings power of this network is going forward? That would be very helpful. Alan Shaw : Yes. Chris, as I've talked about cost structure and service going forward. It was in the context of our new train marshaling rules, which did initially have an impact because we could frankly, we got really conservative on our trained marshaling rules based on the environment and recent events. As we are dialing that in and analyzing each train symbol on each line segment, we're adding capacity back into the network. And as Paul noted, we're using this as an opportunity to significantly increase our use of distributed power, which will frankly ultimately enhance our productivity and our train length. So I feel very confident that we did the right thing at that time, and it's going to generate long-term benefit for NS and our customers and our shareholders, and that's kind of what our strategic vision is all about. Mark? Mark George : Yes. So on East Palestine, Chris, as of the first quarter point in time, we made an estimate of the various elements of costs that we'd be facing and came up with that $387 million. The preponderance of that really is related to the environmental cleanup efforts and future environmental remediation activities. And also, it's important to note that because of the EPA involvement in all of this, there is likely to be oversight costs that we have to reimburse the government for as well. So that's all part of the estimate. There are things that are -- we could not estimate and therefore, could not record in the quarter, stuff really related to legal, I'll give you just one example with the Ohio Attorney General and the three funds that are going to be established. There was no way to estimate that. So that would be an example of something in the future that would come. So as we learn of new things and are able and realize that they're probable and they're estimable, we will record those. But at the same time, I remind you that there are no insurance recovery estimates that have been recorded at this point. In fact, of that $387 million, cash out the door has really been $55 million, okay? So most of this is accrual based on estimates. Insurance filings will really be done as we incur the costs from a cash perspective. So down the road, we'll be assembling our filings for the insurance companies and seeking reimbursement, and we will record those in due course as a credit. And so with regard to predictability or estimating those, it's impossible if we could estimate and we probably would have booked them already. So we'll just have to keep reporting these out as we go in the subsequent quarters. Alan Shaw : Yes. And I'll add nor does our estimate include any potential recovery from other parties as well. Mark George : Correct, correct. Yes. Operator : Our next question is from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed. Scott Group : Thanks. Mark, the materials costs were really high. Any color on where that goes from here? Just any thoughts on the operating ratio from here? And then separately, Ed, the Merchandise yields actually fell a little bit from Q4 to Q1. I thought Q1 has a lot of repricing. I just would have thought Merchandise yields would have been better. Any color there? Thank you. Mark George : Yes. So on materials, Scott, the impact from what we had early in the year had a pretty profound sudden impact on the network. We needed to get locomotives to help dig us out, so we basically took locomotives out of stored status. Some of them required a lot of work to get them rejuvenated so they could help take us out. I think there will be some incremental material costs that will linger here in the second quarter and should ease in the back half of the year as we see our network fluidity improve. Ed? Claude Elkins : Sure. Our core pricing remained very strong in the first quarter. As a matter of fact, we exceeded our expectations in several markets, including in Coal and Intermodal. I think what you're really seeing on the Merchandise side is a mix issue. We noted that plastics was weak and some of our other chemicals. A lot of it goes into housing and everybody knows what's happening to the housing markets right now. It's a challenge, but that's a mix issue. Our core pricing story remains very much intact and in fact, I'm very bullish for it. Operator : Our next question is from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed. Brandon Oglenski : Yes, good morning. And thanks for taking the question. Paul, can you talk to the train makeup changes that you guys discussed and how that had a near-term impact, but what's going to change in the future that allows you to get back to your productivity targets? Alan Shaw : Hey Brandon, I'm going to cover that because that's something that Paul and I discussed at length. As I noted, we had some tough decisions to make in the first quarter. And the train makeup rules was -- decision was based on the ongoing environment of recent events. Paul and I had a discussion in early March, and we decided we were going to get really conservative on our train makeup rules until we had an opportunity to deeply and thoroughly analyze each train symbol over each line segment. That created some congestion on our network because it had an initial impact on reducing capacity on our network. Paul and his team are going through each train symbol, each line segment, doing the analysis, looking at the physics, figuring out the right configuration of the train and the right configuration for the locomotives. And as we do that, we're adding capacity back in. As Paul noted, that includes expanded use of distributed power, which is going to support our productivity initiatives going forward. And ultimately, we are convinced that it's not going to have an impact on service. It's not going to have an impact on capacity and in many cases, it's probably going to improve productivity. Brandon Oglenski : Thank you, Alan. Operator : Our next question is from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. Amit Mehrotra : Thanks. Sorry about earlier. I'm clearly still learning how to use a telephone. So appreciate you calling in me again. Alan, I wanted to ask about how the remediation efforts are going. I think the EPA update the few pages that they put out a few weeks ago was pretty positive in terms of the progress that you guys are making. And just related to that, what do you think the volume impact has been? Because you were at this kind of 130,000 to 140,000 weekly carloads. Obviously, that's dipped down, just helpful to think -- do you think there's a snapback in early June? And then Mark, I'm also trying to understand the impact fuel has on yield and operating income. It's been volatile to the downside, and I'm just thinking that maybe it turns into a headwind on OI dollars as you progress through the year. Any thoughts around that in terms of what the headwind or tailwind or neutrality is from fuel on operating income as we progress through the year? Thank you. Alan Shaw : Yes, Amit, I'll handle the first part of your three-part one question. Yes, when we -- when this happened, we said we're going to stay true to our core values, and we're going to do what's right. And that means we're going to do what's right for the long-term best interest of Norfolk Southern and East Palestine. And frankly, our response in East Palestine has reinforced my conviction that taking a long-term view, the best interest of your shareholders, your customers, your employees and the communities you serve, as a customer-centric operations-driven service organization is the right vision and the right strategy for Norfolk Southern. And so I met with the Head of the EPA, and I made my personal commitment that we were going to do more than less. And that's what you're seeing. We've got 300 people on the ground whether they are employees or contractors, seven days a week, and I sincerely appreciate their sacrifices and their willingness to do this, and frankly, the sacrifices of their families as well. And they're intently focused on the environmental remediation. They're intently focused on community assistance and they're intently focused on helping the community thrive. And we've reached a major milestone about week and half ago, where we finished the remediation under one track and have started on another track. And that was something that we did, didn't necessarily need to be done because we had an environmentally acceptable solution in place, but that was something that we did based on feedback that I received from the citizens of the community and from the EPA. Ed, do you want to talk about what you're seeing in the markets and the volume impact of the slower network but also the macro trends? Claude Elkins : Sure, absolutely. And it's kind of a -- I'll try to answer it in two parts. Let's go to the industrial side first. Clearly, as we accelerate our network, work off the backlog of inventory at our yards, we're going to be able to present our customers with more capacity. And we know that there are customers that are ready to load that additional capacity right now whether it's in the steel markets, whether it's in the scrap markets. It's certainly in the auto markets. And I would also mention our ag and our Coal networks, which also are going to benefit from increased fluidity and sustained demand, we believe going forward. On the Intermodal side, it's really a demand story. There's been what I would call a tremendous amount of demand destruction out there in the general economy, and we're seeing that manifest itself in our containerized volume opportunities. But look, we're not sitting on our hands here. We got, like I said, the best team in the industry working right now to figure out how to deliver more value for our customers in the form of additional lanes and additional products and services that we can successfully execute in the marketplace and we'll be ready when the market rotates here. Alan Shaw : And you and Paul are also resizing the Intermodal network based on current demand. Claude Elkins : That's right. Mark George : Look, it's not a question of when the volume and the demand from the U.S. consumers are going to recover. It's when it happens, right? And so that's part of our strategy is to invest through the downturn so that we're there for the upside. Claude Elkins : Yes. And that's what makes it, frankly, so important that we've been able to insulate for the most part the Intermodal network from many of the disruptions that we've seen here today. And that's very purposeful on our part because we want our customers to have confidence as they go to their customers and sell Norfolk Southern's value. Alan Shaw : Mark, I think there was a. Mark George : Yes. So just real quick on fuel. We did have a lag benefit. While fuel prices are coming down, we had a lag benefit on the surcharge that provided some tailwind to us in this quarter, but that is going to quickly diminish and turn into headwinds as we go through the back of the year if the fuel curves hold true. Operator : Our next question is from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Jordan Alliger : Hi, I think you addressed this in some ways, but I'm just curious, the derailment and the impact on the various service metrics. Has it had an impact on the marketing side of the equation as you go out and try to sell business? And then sort of similarly, in terms of the operational stuff you guys were trying to do as you went into this year around TOP|SPG, et cetera, has had an impact on some of the initiatives away from the remediation efforts? Thanks. Claude Elkins : Speaking to our -- to the customer side of the business, there's -- we really have not had a more supportive group of constituents out there than our customers. They want us to get the network back up and running. They know that we're doing the right thing, not only for East Palestine but for them. And frankly, we are looking forward to delivering that additional capacity to them very quickly. Alan Shaw : Hey Jordan, both Ed and I referenced this in our prepared remarks. We certainly appreciate the support and the outreach from our customers through this. And they're proud of our response. They see what we're doing. They know what we're made of. They know that we do what we say we're going to do, and they're seeing us follow through with that. And so we're going to come out of this stronger and better as a result. Paul, do you want to talk about the interaction between our operating plan and current service? Paul Duncan : Oh, absolutely. We're seeing improvements over the last few weeks. And I want to go back to the point that was made around TOP|SPG. TOP|SPG was implemented as a simpler, more executable plan that will provide us a quicker path to improving service, especially when we have major service interruptions. We've seen strong improvements in our Intermodal franchise as of late, building on the momentum out of the TOP|SPG implementation last year that I referenced. Again, right now, this is all about pent-up demand and inventory across the network in our Merchandise space, we're going to continue to work after it. Operator : Our next question is from Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed. Brian Ossenbeck : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe to follow-up with Ed first. You mentioned you had some stronger-than-expected results both in Coal and Intermodal ARPU. Wondering if you could give some thoughts on that as both of those because we have some pretty distinct factors and tailwinds that have been affected them more recently in terms of the export market and the storage fees. And then, Alan, maybe you can just give us a sense of the timing for some of these other public hearings or maybe mile markers that we should be keeping in mind for the NTSB and their investigation, the public hearing of East Palestine, takes your view, things that are pretty much unprecedented. But I think it will still be helpful to hear if there's any sort of time line we should keep on our calendars in terms of when the next updates for these investigations are expected or at least what we should consider the next sort of update when it comes to those things, not just the numbers that you're recording, but the more public-facing side of it? Thank you. Claude Elkins : I think that might be a record for nesting questions. All right, Brian. Let's talk about Coal first. We're still seeing strength in pricing, but all the indices have come off the recent highs. And as you know, a lot of our performance is predicated off those forward curves. Low-volatile at 250-ish and API is about 140, U.S. met coal forward curves still have the price above 200 throughout at least the third quarter. So we're feeling pretty good there. I think the real story is on the demand and supply side. We know that China is reopening the Australian coal that's going to revert some trade flows. [indiscernible], which will mean stronger Australian supply will come back, but U.S. met production is increasing 5.4 metric tons. That's new mines and incremental production. And I think most of those tons are going to move export. On the demand side, we're still seeing limited spot demand, but European production has increased about 14% month-over-month in February, and that's due to blast furnaces cranking back up again. And the met coal exports from the U.S. are forecast to increase about 7.5%. Now we can be bullish or we could be bearish about China. I prefer to be bullish. The Chinese Manufacturing PMI Index came in above 52%. That's the highest reading in two years. So I believe that there is some demand there. We know that there's healthy demand from the auto sector. So we feel good about Coal going forward. On the Intermodal side, there's no doubt there's a headwind from the storage piece and as I noted in the prepared remarks, we're seeing those markets -- excuse me, those congestion charges unwind even faster than we expected. Even though we predicted a year ago that they were going to unwind faster, so as those normalize, that's good for volume, as I noted on the IPI side. And think about it this way, for our international volume to grow 9%, that was freight that was moving on the highway last year. And we talked a lot last year about how it was going to revert to the mean when markets normalize, and that's what we're seeing right now. Alan Shaw : And Brian, with respect to hearings, the NTSB has announced it may conduct a field here in the summer, as you noted. That date has not yet been finalized. We don't really have anything else scheduled at this point, but that doesn't mean others won't pop up. I met with the Chair of the NTSB just last week and committed our full cooperation with their investigation. And you saw as soon as the NTSB released its preliminary results, we initiated a six-point safety plan. And I'll also note that I've been in D.C. multiple occasions with our elected officials and with our regulators, offering my full-throated support for many of the provisions in the rail safety bills that are out there. We are going to take and we have taken an industry-leading role in advancing these safety initiatives, and we embrace that role. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed. Tom, please check and see if this is muted. Okay. We will come back to him. And our next question will be from Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed. Jeffrey Kauffman : Thank you very much. And congratulations in a challenging quarter. I've only got one question. Everyone is trying to figure out, is this a recession? Is this not a recession? Are we heading into a recession? There's a lot of anomalies in your data because of the single track that you're running in a key part of your line and the effect that's having on traffic. But I'd love to hear your view in terms of what's the macro? Where do you believe we're headed? And then kind of how do we back out the effect of your remediation efforts on your own traffic volumes here? Alan Shaw : Ed, you're about as tight with our customers as can be. Why don't you talk about what you're hearing? Claude Elkins : Sure. I think the one word that describes it best is murkiness, and quite frankly, it doesn't matter whether you're on the consumer side of the coin or on the industrial side, there is a clear line of sight, I think on the industrial markets for a quarter or two of demand. We see that clearly. We also see clearly that there is further deterioration in the truckload markets right now. The real question is the second half of the year. And you have heard from other calls and other entities that probably their outlook has changed somewhat, particularly on the consumer side. But we know that there's still pent-up demand in many of these industrial markets. So I am with you in terms of there's a lot of cross currents out there and a tremendous amount of, again murkiness, but I think the one thing I want to reassure you of is we are positioning ourselves to be ready when these markets do turn and they will turn. Operator : And we will come back to Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed. Thomas Wadewitz : Yes, good morning. Sorry about that. Mark, I wanted to ask you if you could help us think about operating ratio. You've got a lot of moving parts right now. It seems pretty clear when you look at second half maybe or beyond June, you could see some help from the network being more fluid. But how do we think about maybe seasonal pattern in OR relative to what's normal if you think about 2Q versus 1Q? Or if you assume stability in volume or some pickup in volume, how do you think about it in the second half, given that you've got storage charges revenue per car maybe in export? Just a lot of moving parts, but any thoughts on OR would be helpful. Thank you. Mark George : Yes, thanks for the question, Tom. So look I think inflation is going to be a consistent pressure point for our operating ratio throughout the year. So if we think about that as probably a primary headwind. I'd say that's probably fairly consistent throughout the year. Service has kind of emerged in the first quarter as kind of a bigger headwind, and we were expecting that really to start unwinding here. And the reality is, it may continue to be a headwind for another quarter before that starts to flip and become a tailwind in the second half, assuming service does get back to where we know it should be kind of where we were in that January time frame. Let's not forget, we really did have a very good January and the pain we're seeing here in the quarter is really a result of just February and March. I do believe that we get some volume in the back half of the year, that will represent some tailwind and then I think the third component to bear in mind is fuel, as touched upon earlier, there's been a tailwind here in the first quarter. It might be a modest tailwind in the second quarter. And again, if the fuel curves hold constant, it will become more of a headwind in the back half. Operator : Our next question is from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Ravi Shanker : Great, thanks everyone. So just a couple of follow-ups here. Just on the settlement itself, is the message from you that the accrual that you made in 1Q is like the high watermark for how much it's going to cost you and could potentially come down as you get the insurance claims? Or kind of do you think that as the settlements are kind of further legal action or something takes place over the next several years kind of that number could go up. Just trying to mention what you see the number does over time. And also, I think you guys have been the kind of biggest proponents of using mixed freight trends of probably any of the U.S. class 1 railroads. Do you think your ability to run that is going to be slightly diminished kind of post this afternoon? Thank you. Alan Shaw : Ravi, I think Mark was pretty clear that there are some moving parts in our estimate. There are some things that we know that are going to hit that have not been estimated. That includes additional charges. It also includes the potential for insurance claims and also recoveries from other third parties. What we've given you now is what we're able to accrue. With respect to our mix freight, our new train marshaling rules, which have really enhanced the use of DP are going to allow us to leverage that and drive productivity into that network. Operator : Our next question is from Jason Seidl with TD Cowen. Please proceed. Jason Seidl : Thank you, operator. Good morning gentlemen. How should we think about headcount sequentially sort of as we move throughout the year? And you mentioned your below minimum staffing levels in a good part of your network. And then I think before you mentioned this time around, even in the downturn, you're going to think about furloughs a lot differently than you have in the past. I would just like to get a little bit of color on that. Alan Shaw : Well, Jason, as we talked about, as we articulated our unique vision for the industry, we are going to invest throughout a downturn because we want to make sure we're there for the upturn. It's not a question of -- if demand returns, it's only a question of when. And we're taking a long-term approach. That's the right thing to do for our shareholders and our customers and our employees and the communities we serve. You want to add a little bit more color on headcount, Mark? Mark George : Well, yes, I think you see that we've got some trajectory in Paul's slide on our T&E count. We still have over 900 of conductor trainees. And as Paul mentioned, we've got a fair amount of our key locations that are still below our targeted levels. And we want to get to resilient levels in our locations here because we're feeling the pain of not being resilient. We made a promise to be resilient in our new strategy, and we're committed to get there. Unfortunately, we're not there yet, and that's part of why you're seeing us deal with the service challenge here again here in the second quarter. So there's more hiring to do. I think you'll start to see once we get to the levels we determine are appropriate at all of our locations will bring our train e-counts down probably by more than half of where they are today, and that will help us just handle normal attrition. But remember, the targeted numbers for headcount really is a dynamic number. And it does depend on the volume outlook and the demand outlook by area, by commodity type, by lane. So there's really a lot more sophisticated modeling than ever we put into trying to determine what our appropriate levels are. So I think you will continue to see it go up throughout the course of the year. Operator : Our next question is from Justin Long with Stephens Inc. Please proceed. Justin Long : Thanks. I wanted to circle back to Intermodal. If I look at your domestic Intermodal volumes, they've declined sequentially for three consecutive quarters. And obviously, there's weakness in demand that you've talked about, and that's well known. But what's your confidence that first quarter is the bottom in terms of domestic Intermodal volumes? Or is there a potential we see sequential pressure continue into 2Q? Claude Elkins : I think it's really going to be predicated by what happens in the overall economy, particularly that consumer sector. We continue to get very strong reports from our customers regarding their ability to win bids going forward. So we're bullish on that part. I think you've heard in other places, though, that many times those bids, the volumes are not manifest themselves at the rate that they were advertised so to speak, because the demand is not there. We're keeping a very close eye on the inventory sales ratio, which is about normal now, there's still maybe a little bit of replenishment to do in certain sectors, but we're close to normal on that front. So we're watching very closely what's happening in the macro economy, I firmly believe that as the market rotates, we will be very well positioned to take advantage of that first growth that comes out of the gate. Alan Shaw : Yes, we're aligned with the best channel partners in the industry. And they're investing for growth right now through the soft patch. So we're going to grow with them. And Ed, you were able to take share from truck and the international market. Claude Elkins : No, that's exactly right. I would also say we're putting a lot of emphasis on the quality of our Intermodal product at the terminal level. And we are also focused on first and final mile markets and how we can deliver additional value there. So we're very well positioned, we believe to come out of this as the market rotates. Operator : Our next question is from Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed. James McGarragle : Hey this is James McGarragle on for Walter this morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask a question though related to the new Scout Motors EV plant in our South Carolina. Are you able to discuss -- any other opportunities like this that you have in the pipeline? And now looking a little longer term, what's the team strategy to bring more of this type of business to the railroad. Is it utilizing excess real estate or selling and eventually improved service product? Or anything else you can speak to? Thanks. ClaudeElkins: Sure. Absolutely. We have over 600 active projects in our pipeline. And while we can't talk about really any of those, many of them under NDA, what I can tell you is that we are really well positioned to serve the EV and battery ecosystems including support for additional battery manufacturing and as they search for plant sites for manufacturing. The recent Scout Motors assembly plant and proposed reopening of a lithium mine nearby, present some more unique opportunities for us. There's three opportunities really for us to participate in the EV space. One is moving raw materials, one is moving components and one is moving the finished vehicles. We're actively working on all three of those segments. Operator : Our next question is from David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed. David Vernon : Hey guys, thanks for fitting me in here. So Mark, can you talk a little bit about the trajectory for cost per employees to kind of go throughout the year, the $140 million level, is that a good number to be modeling off of and then, Ed, if you wouldn't mind, maybe -- I want to take a run at asking you to mention how much the accessorial and surcharge revenue headwind could be inside of the Intermodal ARPU. I just want to make sure we're not confusing the minus 1 in ARPU ex-fuel with core price as opposed to accessorial. And if you could help us to mention that, that would be helpful. Thank you. Mark George : Yes. David, real quick, on the comp and ben per employee. First quarter was pretty much like I had guided last quarter that $35,000 range. And I do expect it to kind of go sideways from here throughout the course of the year. We will have a step up in the third quarter just from the wage increase that happens for the agreement folks, another 4% here in the third quarter, but that should be mitigated by a wind-down and in some of these service-related costs. So I'd say it's going to be in that $35,000 and change territory throughout the year -- per quarter. Claude Elkins : Yes. And on the road side, we made a I think we expect year-over-year declines in accessorial revenue. It really be a significant headwind to revenue or ARPU less fuel for the remainder of '23 and that's going to be offset by some positive impacts from price and volume, our plan. And then beginning in '24, the revenue from accessorial charges is likely to be much more in line with what we've experienced pre-pandemic. First quarter, we took a significant step towards normalization, as I noted. Operator : Our next question is from Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please proceed. Jonathan Chappell : Thank you. Good morning. Mark, on your Slide 7, when you lay out the OpEx components, I understand there's a lot of inflation associated with that. But is there any way to talk about some of the costs associated with just running the one line at a reduced speed from the beginning of March. What we should think about that cost component to be in the second quarter as you go through June? And do you think that those will really be ring-fenced then into the second quarter with kind of normalization starting in early 3Q? Mark George : Yes, Jon, I'd say the cost related to the service disruption we've had, they show up a little bit in the comp and ben with regard to recrews and overtime -- they show up in the purchase services as well. Part of that is related to drayage costs that we have to incur, taxis and we've even had to enter into some short-term land leases just to relieve some congestion in the terminal. So that's kind of where you see that play out. And I think that will persist into the second quarter and diminish in the second half. And similarly, in materials is kind of where I'd say the bigger impact was, and that's related to the locomotive restorations that we've had to do here, just to try to provide some immediate relief to the yards and to our line of road to deal with this disruption. So that, again will probably, we'll probably still have some incremental cost of materials in that second quarter and start to diminish in the third and fourth quarter. Operator : Our next question is from Ari Rosa with Credit Suisse. Please proceed. Ariel Rosa : Great, good morning. So Alan, you mentioned that the crew is operating properly and there were no track defects in the East Palestine incident. Just curious to hear what do you think could have been done differently to avoid that incident? And then with the six-point plan that you guys have proposed, just wanted to get a sense for what you think the costs are associated with that and kind of what the steps are moving forward. Is that included in the $387 million? Or is that a separate cost? Thanks. Alan Shaw : Yes. Obviously, as CEO, I think about that every day. What could we have done better? What could we have done differently? And I asked my team in the immediate aftermath to come up with some solutions. As soon as we got the preliminary results of the NTSB report, you saw the six-point safety plan, which included adding 200 hot box detectors across our network. And I'll note that the spacing of our hot box detectors was already amongst the lowest in the industry. But you know what, we can do better. We're augmenting that. And so we're adding about 25% more hot box detectors. We're partnering with the Georgia Tech Research Institute on next-generation machine visioning, inspection portals. And the first one is going to go up outside of East Palestine. So there are a couple of things that we're doing there. They're all to enhance safety because we're going to continue to focus on doing better. That's our goal. Mark George : And Ari, the cost related to that six-point plan, it's really largely the capital associated with those incremental hot box detectors, which we said would be in that $50 million neighborhood over the next couple of years. So not a meaningful impact to our overall CapEx budget. Ariel Rosa : Got it. Okay, thank you for the thoughts. Operator : Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Alan Shaw for closing comments. Alan Shaw : Yes. Thank you for your interest in Norfolk Southern and your time this morning. Have a good morning. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to introduce Luke Nichols, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, sir. You may begin. Luke Nichols : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Please note that during today's call, we will make certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to future events or future performance of Norfolk Southern Corporation, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and may differ materially from actual results. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. Our presentation slides are available at nscorp.com in the Investors section, along with a reconciliation of any non-GAAP measures used today to the comparable GAAP measures. Turning to Slide 3. It's now my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's President and Chief Executive Officer, Alan Shaw. Alan Shaw : Good morning, and welcome to our discussion of second quarter earnings. Here with me today are Mark George, our Chief Financial Officer; Paul Duncan, our Chief Operating Officer; and Ed Elkins, our Chief Marketing Officer. I would like to begin by thanking all of my colleagues at Norfolk Southern for their tremendous work this quarter. As you will hear this morning, we are delivering on our commitment to recover service quickly. We are delivering on our commitment to make a safe railroad even safer. We are delivering on our commitment to address quality of life issues for our hardworking craft railroaders, and we continue to deliver on our commitment to make things right for the people of East Palestine and the surrounding communities. We have a vision for a better way forward for Norfolk Southern. Last December, we outlined a groundbreaking strategy that balances service, productivity and growth. It is designed to create long-term value for our customers, employees, shareholders and the communities we serve. Our commitment to that strategy was tested on February 3 with the derailment in East Palestine. Adversity reveals character and tests resolve. I'm proud of the way our team rose to the challenge. Our response in East Palestine has been fully aligned with our better way forward, making decisions in the best long-term interest of the community and surrounding areas has achieved significant progress. Our financial results were challenged this quarter as we noted in May that they would be. They reflect the decisive actions we have taken to advance our strategy and keep our promises in East Palestine. With every step forward, we are doing exactly what we said we would do when we announced our strategy last December. We are investing in the long-term success of our company. With our strategy as our road map, we made significant progress in the second quarter, building the foundation for long-term value creation. This morning, I'll share a few notable examples of our progress. I'll start with service. In the first quarter, we expressed confidence that our service challenges were a temporary disruption due to deliberate management actions in response to the derailment and that our recovery plan would show results quickly. We delivered. As Paul will describe shortly, service is now at levels comparable to our best performance in 2019. When we announced our strategy last year, I indicated that we will continue to make disciplined investments in our business through economic cycles. As Mark will describe, we are doing exactly what we said we would do. We continue to expand the ranks of our frontline craft railroaders, and we are investing in locomotives, intermodal infrastructure, new sidings, technology and other assets that will drive service, productivity and growth. We are looking beyond this cycle to be ready to serve our customers and support their growth during the recovery and into the future. Another important way we moved our strategy forward in the second quarter was through our continuing progress engaging more effectively with our frontline railroaders. This is one of my top priorities as CEO, and it is a reason I spent so much time in the field. I've learned from every conversation with my craft colleagues. After the conclusion of our national labor negotiations last year, I promised to work with union leadership at the local level to address quality of life issues. We kept that commitment, and I'm especially proud Norfolk Southern was the first Class 1 railroad to provide paid sick leave for all of our craft employees. We are building on that momentum. It was an extraordinary moment to co-author an open letter with the leaders of 12 railroad unions committing to collaborate on safety. And then a few days later, to share a stage with many of those same leaders in an all-employee town hall meeting to talk about safety and our strategy. Our people are excited to be part of a vision that focuses on growth. Our actions this quarter to advance our strategy extend well beyond operations. They run throughout our company. In marketing, we reorganized the team to align with our strategy, positioning us to maintain the deep customer relationships that characterize Norfolk Southern while simultaneously pursuing growth in high-value markets that make sense for our network. As part of that change, we made the innovative move this quarter to create the industry's first Vice President of First Mile Last Mile, building an entrepreneurial spirit and growth mindset into our organizational structure, continuous productivity improvement through cost management and smart revenue growth is a core element of our strategy. In the second quarter, we created a new performance excellence team within operations, charged with building additional rigor and discipline into our processes. This work is foundational to our strategy. Standardizing our processes supports a high degree of planned compliance, which in turn gives us greater flexibility to innovate and test, targeted improvements that enhance consistent and reliable service and provide productivity opportunities, thus unlocking growth potential. Additionally, we continue to make progress this quarter, strengthening our safety culture, implementing best practices and accelerating technology improvements. We look beyond the rail industry for a partner that would challenge and inspire us. We chose Atkins Nuclear Solutions, which brings experience from the Nuclear Navy, the gold standard of operational excellence and industrial safety. Then, we reached out to the leaders of the national unions representing our frontline craft railroaders, and ask them to work with us to enhance rail safety. Our work is producing results. As Paul will describe in more detail, our safety metrics demonstrate significant improvement. As a result of these initiatives and more, Norfolk Southern today is a railroad poised for long-term value creation. We are implementing our innovative strategic plan and correlating to serve our customers and capture growth when demand inevitably returns. And now, I'll turn it over to Mark for a detailed look at our second quarter results. Mark George : Thank you, Alan, and good morning to everyone. Before we get into the operating results for the quarter, Slide 6 illustrates the financial impact from the Eastern Ohio derailment. There was another $416 million of costs recorded in Q2, primarily driven by environmental cleanup activities. Our estimates reflect the significant progress we've made remediating the site and the continued efforts we expect to undertake related to further restoration efforts. While our estimates reflect our expectation that activity at the site will meaningfully moderate in the fourth quarter, any changes in the nature, extent and duration of the remaining cleanup activities and government oversight activities may impact our current estimate. Additionally, developments with respect to the healthcare fund, which we are creating for affected residents as well as the potential fines, penalties or settlements and ongoing legal expenses will all likely impact our costs in future quarters. Of the $803 million recorded so far this year, only $287 million of the cash has been paid through June 30. We currently expect about half of our accrued balance to be paid over the remainder of the year with the rest in 2024 or later. Our 2023 results do not reflect potential recoveries from third parties or under our insurance coverage. Importantly, you will see in the quarter that we have started the process of pursuing recovery from third parties, a process we will continue to explore where appropriate in connection with our other lawsuits. As for our insurance coverage, we expect to begin filing insurance claims here in the third quarter. This will be the first of many claims that will be made over the coming quarters. To remind everyone, we can only make claims upon payments being made not based on accruals. As you can imagine, insurance reimbursements and third-party recoveries will take time to materialize. Turning to Slide 7. Here, we illustrate the accounting impacts of the incident and response on our key metrics for Q2. At the bottom, you see the adjusted results excluding those impacts. Revenues were down 8% to last year, while adjusted operating expense was flattish. It's important to understand that the incident meaningfully harmed revenues in the quarter because of the resulting service disruption, but that impact is not adjusted from our GAAP figures and mitigating those service impacts cost us money to fix and those costs are also not accounted for in the $416 million operating expense adjustment. Consequently, the adjusted operating ratio was 66.7%. Had we been able to move a couple of hundred million more of revenue with our Q2 cost structure, our margins would have been much stronger. On an adjusted basis, operating income was down 22%, net Income was down 18%, and EPS was down 14%. Moving to Slide 8. Adjusted operating expenses for the quarter were up slightly on a year-over-year basis. Compensation and benefits were up $79 million or 13% in the quarter due to wage inflation and ongoing hiring to primarily shore up the remaining challenged locations on our network and in support of our strategic plan to build long-term network resiliency. Materials and other expenses in the quarter were up $33 million or 19% driven primarily by a continuation of the locomotive related work we discussed during the first quarter call, bringing part of the stored fleet back into service to successfully accelerate the network, which you will hear more about from Paul. Additionally, in other, the quarter was impacted by lower gains on the sale of property. Purchased services and rents were up $25 million or 5% this quarter as the challenge network created more headwinds to the category in addition to our continued investments in technology. Depreciation was up $17 million in the quarter, in line with our guidance. Mitigating these increases were fuel expenses which were down $145 million or 36% in the quarter. Turning to Slide 9. Let's look at the adjusted P&L results below the line. Partially mitigating the $279 million reduction in adjusted operating income was a $71 million increase in other income, driven by favorable investment returns and compares from company-owned life insurance. Net income and EPS were down 18% and 14%, respectively, in the quarter. Moving to free cash flow and shareholder returns on Slide 10. Through the first six months, free cash flow was lower by $276 million due to combined pressure from the derailment-related expenditures as well as investments in roadway and equipment. Shareholder distributions during the first half were $918 million, thanks to our solid dividend and share repurchase activity. I'll now turn it over to Paul for a discussion on our operations. Paul Duncan : Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Let's jump right into our safety update on Slide 12. Everything starts with safety. We continue to make progress this year enhancing safety. Our injury frequency ratio is trending down 12% year-to-date versus last year. Our accident rates for the first half of the year is also down from prior years and our mainline train accident rate is trending improved 40% year-to-date versus last year. I want to take a moment to thank our leaders and our craft colleagues for collectively enhancing safety and driving these outcomes for our team, the communities we serve and our customers. We'll transition to our progress in safely delivering a reliable and resilient service product on Slide 13. You will recall during our last earnings call that we expected service to improve in summer and we have delivered on that promise. We've successfully restored our double-track mainline through East Palestine in a safe and environmentally appropriate way and we wasted no time resetting network performance levels our customers expect in this quarter between the Midwest and the Northeast. We have significantly improved train velocity, dwell and service across our network to two-year best resulting from these improvements. With service improved, our focus now is driving further reliability, productivity and resiliency in our network aligned with our strategic vision outlined in December. Touching on Slide 14. Now, what we told you would be an important measure of our service recovery reduction in cars online. Following the first quarter service interruptions, we had an inventory buildup. We set in place a plan to work down to build up as quickly as possible while also restoring our mainline and overall network conditions. We successfully executed on that plan and railcars are now cycling throughout our network faster than they have since before 2022, achieving greater railcar fleet productivity. Turning to Slide 15 for an update on our hiring progress. Our efforts to right-size our team accrual based have continued the first half of this year. We are now at a point at which the training pipeline has crested and will begin to taper down over the back half of the year. We are committed to maintaining an appropriately-sized workforce to drive reliability and long-term resilience as part of our strategy. Our productivity metrics are shown on Slide 16. Our short-term service challenges described earlier contributed to productivity impacts as we work to restore service and velocity. Mark mentioned earlier that we return to serve as a portion of our road locomotive fleet to expedite our service recovery. With service and locomotive velocity much improved as we enter summer, we have now right-sized our road fleet and are now achieving velocity near 200 miles per day with our locomotives. As part of our strategy to become not only reliable, but more resilient we have allocated a portion of our road locomotive fleet to surge capacity to be hot and ready to run at key locations of our network when needed. We continue to have a solid outlook for our locomotive fleet. Our DC to AC program is ongoing, which will provide us with a capacity dividend not only in terms of AC traction but also improvements in fuel efficiency. Transitioning to the workforce. T&E productivity was challenged due to the effort we put in place to accelerate the network, coupled with the contraction in volumes. Moving forward, we expect to improve T&E productivity through a variety of initiatives improving velocity, absorbing volume on existing trains and normalizing our CT pipeline. Lastly, on fuel, we took a step back for the first time in seven quarters. This was largely due to lower velocity and fewer GTMs on the network as we are restoring service. We are very confident that our initiatives that have been paying regular dividends will continue driving us towards further fuel efficiency as we continue to see the benefits of an improving network. Moving forward on Slide 17. Our focus will be on safely and productively delivering reliable and resilient service. Every conversation will start with safety as we continue to enhance it through the initiatives that we discussed. With service improved, our goal now is to continue to build further reliability and resiliency in the network but to do so productively. Velocity and service improvements will provide us further opportunities to leverage and spin our assets while pushing to drive further process standardization into our scheduled network to drive productivity. This is the primary focus of our new performance excellence team, which was created this year. We will also continue to leverage the capital investments we have made to increase productivity, including recent siding projects between Chicago and Cincinnati that will allow us to increase train length and capacity in this quarter. Thank you and I will now hand it off to Ed Elkins. Ed Elkins : Thanks, Paul, and good morning to everybody on the call. Beginning on Slide 19, I'll review our commercial results for the quarter. Now as we expected, the second quarter came with challenges related to ongoing soft freight demand, lower commodity prices and still recovering service levels. In total, we generated just under $3 billion in revenue for the quarter, down 8% from the second quarter of last year and that's driven by a 6% drop in volume and lower revenue from fuel and accessorials. ARPU was also down year-over-year. However, revenue per unit less fuel improved 1% reflecting gains in price and favorable mix, and that's driven by tempered demand for intermodal and utility coal. I'd like to note here that underneath this favorable overall mix narrative, there was significant negative mix within markets that tempered overall revenue per unit performance, which I'll note below. Now merchandise results were varied as favorable conditions in the markets for automotive and agriculture products were offset by headwinds in chemicals markets. And that's a good example of the challenging RPU mix within markets that I just mentioned. Automotive volumes were driven by robust finished vehicle production and agriculture shipments were strong due to new lane offerings and a weak local crop in the Southeast. Offsetting this growth was weakness in several of our chemical commodities as well as challenges to meet customer demand in key markets such as metals, aggregates and finished vehicles. Taken together, total merchandise volume and revenue for the second quarter came in 1% below prior year levels. Revenue per unit was flat year-over-year, but RPU less fuel grew 2%, which makes 32 out of the last 33 quarters that we've achieved growth in this metric. And I think that is a clear signal that our diverse portfolio and strong pricing discipline are delivering results. Turning to Intermodal. Continued market headwinds were felt the strongest in our domestic lines of business where volumes declined 14% year-over-year as weak freight demand, high inventories and excess truck capacity weighed on performance. Conversely, in a continuation of the first quarter trend, international volumes increased 1% year-over-year and 5.8% sequentially over last quarter. As we guided to before, our customers have continued to shift highway freight back into IPI services and storage charges have declined as supply chain fluidity and container dwell have returned to pre-pandemic normalcy. As you would expect with this performance, Intermodal is another segment where ARPU mix with end markets was challenging for us. Both RPU and RPU less fuel were down significantly due to lower revenue from fuel surcharge and storage charges. Lastly, coal volume was flat year-over-year, but coal revenue fell 4% as RPU declined. Utility volumes were down 17% year-over-year due to historically low natural gas prices and elevated stockpiles. These declines were offset by gains in export shipments as a result of increased production and robust overseas demand. Although export volumes increased, the mix between export steam and export metallurgical coal shifted unfavorably and comparatively lower seaborne coal prices yielded lower revenue per unit. Again, a key segment where ARPU mix within markets was a headwind. With that, let's turn to Slide 20 and review our outlook for the remainder of 2023. Overall, we're confident that our service product positions us to realize growth when market conditions improve. And as the year progresses, we are focused on pursuing the opportunities in markets that have the highest potential for growth for Norfolk Southern. We expect to increase our share in these markets as an improving service product and a sharply focused organization allows us to realize more of the ongoing demand for our services. Beginning with merchandise markets, conditions vary by individual market, and we see strong levels of nonresidential construction as reshoring and infrastructure projects increase which will drive strength in metals and construction volume. Pent-up demand for U.S. light vehicles will continue to support metals and automotive volumes. However, we expect continued weakness in our chemicals markets in the second half. Turning to Intermodal. We expect international volumes to continue its growth trend with an expected rebound in import volumes and the continued share growth of IPI. Storage charges will continue to be a revenue and RPU headwind compared to last year. On the domestic side, overall growth will be dependent on the U.S. consumer, retail inventory levels and the truck market. We worked really hard with our best-in-class channel partners to sustain our service levels throughout the quarter during the crucial climax of bid season, and we're hearing from our key partners that our strategy is helping them increase their share of bid wins. We look forward to leveraging our capacity to realize this growth as market conditions improve. And finally, within our coal markets, we expect overall volume growth as continued strength in export markets more than offset weakness in utility coal. Coal production levels at NS-served mines will drive growth in export shipments, although we do expect lower seaborne coal prices to negatively impact RPU. The utility outlook is largely dependent on the weather, on existing stockpiles and natural gas prices. The net result is we expect total coal RPU to sequentially decline by a low double-digit percentage. Despite uncertainty across the economy, our focus on service, productivity and growth remains at the core of our strategy, and we're confident in our ability to grow our franchise and deliver value for our customers. On that note, I'd like to draw your attention to Slide 21, which highlights the strength of Norfolk Southern's network and our ability to drive growth both now and in the future. The ecosystem for electric vehicles has been steadily developing in recent years as demonstrated by last quarter's announcement of the new Scout Motors plant on Norfolk Southern. We are focused on all facets of this emerging EV supply chain, including the EV battery and battery components. Over the last 18 months, more than $70 billion in new investment has been announced for building out EV battery manufacturing plants across North America. Our commercial team has worked to help locate nearly 1/3 of that investment on our network, including most recently in the second quarter, a new $3 billion General Motors and Samsung battery manufacturing plant in Indiana, on a Norfolk Southern main line. Norfolk Southern's network is well positioned for future industrial development. We reached 60% of the U.S. population and cover 50% of our manufacturing base. We look forward to amplifying that strength through continued industrial development wins. Year-to-date, our industrial development team has reported $2.6 billion in industry investment that's been completed along Norfolk Southern lines, bringing 3,200 new jobs to the local communities that we serve. We continue to invest in site readiness for our highest potential industrial sites, and we're confident our diverse portfolio of shovel-ready sites combined with the strength of our network, we'll continue to land new opportunities across our network. With that, I'll turn it back over to Alan to bring us home. Alan Shaw : Thanks, Ed. Let's turn to Slide 22. As we have reached midpoint of 2023, I want to provide you with an update to our outlook. Although we entered the year expecting to achieve revenues comparable to 2022, the first half revenue shortfalls require us to modify our full year outlook. We now anticipate revenue to be down at least 3% in 2023 implying some modest volume improvements in the back half. We're also expecting modestly higher capital expenditures for the year as we accelerate investments in safety, service, productivity and growth. Finally, I want to close our prepared remarks by reconfirming the commitment of the entire Norfolk Southern team to delivering long-term shareholder value through top-tier revenue and earnings growth at industry competitive margins with balanced capital deployment. I'm confident that our strategy will help us achieve our full potential, and I'm encouraged by our progress and investments. We will now open the call to questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Brandon Oglenski : Alan, I guess, can you give us an update on lessons learned here as you've reworked your train makeup, I think, through the second quarter? And how has that impacted your operational planning going forward? And does that create incremental capacity for you guys if markets recover, which I think Mark was alluding to earlier. Alan Shaw : Brendon, we remade our train makeup and starting in March. And we guided to the fact that we would expect service to improve as we moved out of the second quarter and into the third quarter coupled with the fact that we're going to get the second track back in East Palestine that's absolutely what we delivered. Our service is on the trajectory that we had guided to. And what we're seeing as a result over the last couple of weeks is real strength in our volume sequentially and also relative to the rest of the industry. With respect to our updated operating plan and train makeup rules, it gives us an opportunity to create more capacity as we've increased the utilization of distributed power which helps our cost structure, helps our service product and helps our capacity for growth. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Ken Hoexter : Just before I get to the question, two clarifications, Mark. You said 1% ARPU gain ex-fuel on mix and price. So if mix was positive, are you saying pricing is less than 1%? Or are you saying intra-category mix hides the pricing gain. And then second, you mentioned the real estate gain. Did you mention what it was in the quarter? And then my question is on carload growth. Alan, you mentioned accelerating growth in the second half of the year. Peers are talking about RTMs or industrial production being down slightly. I just want to understand how you're targeting that acceleration in the second half, maybe detail that a little more. Mark George : Yes, Ken, we were talking about intra-category price there. And then with regard to the real estate gains in the quarter, I think we said it was $19 million absolute in the quarter itself. Go ahead... Alan Shaw : Yes. Ken. And with respect to volumes moving forward, clearly, our volumes were pressured in the second quarter and in the last two months of the first quarter because of the service degradation. That's why it was really important for us to hit the service targets and the service recovery trajectory that we had committed to publicly and with our customers. We've done that. And as a result, our equipment is turning faster and customers are talking to us about incorporating Norfolk Southern into their long-term supply chain solutions. Ed, do you want to give a little bit more color on that? Ed Elkins : Yes. When we look at our volumes compared to the other Class 1s over the course of 2023, our volumes outperformed the industry average for nine of the first 10 weeks of the year and we were feeling good. And then as you know, the network slowed and congestion build up, our performance suffered, but as we started to speed up, our relative performance also has started to recover. And over the last 11 weeks, I think this is important. We've outperformed the industry average for nine of those weeks. And the outperformance that we've been experiencing is accelerating placing us in the top two of the Class 1 railroads for four of the five last weeks. And I will tell you, I spoke about it in the prepared remarks, there are a few bright spots out there where we're focused on delivering growth for our customers through better service. That includes in the automotive industry where we see clear line of sight on continued demand. And then you think about infrastructure spending that's going on all around the country, but particularly in our footprint as well as residential construction that's really tied to new home construction because people with low interest rates are just staying in those houses. So folks who need a home are going out and building a new one, we see some clear bright spots there. And the real key is, we're focused on those markets. We're present in those markets with our sales teams and our operating teams. And as the network continues to speed up, we're going to deliver more value for those customers. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Amit Mehrotra : Just wondering what inning we are here in terms of the sequential drawdown in intermodal yields. I assume you've got some new pricing that's being implemented on July 1. You've got more runoff of the storage fees. What's the right way to think about intermodal yields from here? And then Mark, there's a lot of like puts and takes on profit cadence from here. On one side, there's a lot of service issues and inefficiencies related to that in the second quarter, but then you've got the coal yield dropping off, maybe a little bit more yield pressure on fuel that impacts operating income. I mean do we grow operating income off of the second quarter in the back half? If you can just kind of give us some of the puts and takes there. Alan Shaw : Ed, you want to take the first question? Ed Elkins : Yes. Yes. If you want to -- let's talk about RPU first, particularly within intermodal. Core pricing remains positive for Intermodal. And more importantly, I think I highlighted it during the prepared remarks, the mix within Intermodal has been pretty dynamic. And because of our success in those international markets and delivering value through more IPI business, that mix is negative for overall ARPU within intermodal. Sure. Again, when we think about supply chain congestion, I think it's pretty much gone. I'd say supply chains are really about as fluid now as they were prior to the pandemic. And in fact, there may be a little bit more capacity. We monitor warehouse activity pretty closely and the supply chains index -- or excuse me, the Logistics Managers Index, which we pay attention to noted that warehouse capacity has increased at the fastest rate since the start of the pandemic. It's a challenge, and we've seen those storage charges roll-off and essentially turn to really a pre-pandemic normal. Alan Shaw : You've also seen us take share from truck in the international market. Ed Elkins : Yes, that is what I was referring to with increased IPI shipments. The international markets are looking for ways to add value for their customers and the service we're providing in IPI is a clear way for them to do that. Mark George : Amit, let me go through a little bit of the first half, second half dynamic because there are some changes here for sure. We do expect some modestly higher volumes from the better service product we have here in the back half. So that's definitely going into the tailwind category. We will start to see a partial wind down of the service costs here in the second half as well. And fuel expense is going to be less of a headwind than it was in the first half. But we got some sizable headwinds here in the back half, principally on the ARPU side. The fuel surcharge really starts to diminish here and the lag benefit disappears on us. So this fuel will be a real negative in the back half, certainly to margins. And as Ed mentioned, intermodal storage is basically back at pre-pandemic levels now, which means we're going to continue to have quarter-over-quarter headwinds until we lap this probably in the second quarter of next year. And then, of course, if the futures hold, we're going to have international seaborne coal pricing headwind as well in the RPU side. So that's pretty much the headwind and tailwind equation. So if the volumes come in, like we think a little bit of back half tailwind, we should get some OR improvement from here and the more the better because we got a lot of capacity on the railroad right now. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott Group : So Mark, you're saying hopefully, some OR, just you're saying, hopefully, some OR improvement from Q2 into the back half of the year? Mark George : Yes. Volumes, we expect to really provide us a little bit of tailwind here. And I think it's all going to depend on how much volume we're able to bring on to the railroad. Alan Shaw : Look, we were really clear in May that OR would be really pressured in the second quarter because we're going to have three months of service disruption as we've delivered on our commitment to improve service throughout the quarter and moving into third quarter. That creates more opportunity for volume and it creates a better cost structure for us. We will still have those headwinds that Mark called out, particularly with respect to fuel surcharge and comps on... Mark George : On coal pricing Alan Shaw : On coal pricing but the underlying product and our ability to onboard volume at strong incrementals is improving. Scott Group : And so ultimately, I guess, you've given us a little bit of color on OR and some color on coal RPU. But how should we think about overall RPU when I factor in the fuel headwind, some of the maybe continued storage headwind? Like what's -- how much do you think is overall RPU going to be down in Q3? Just that I think it would be helpful. Ed Elkins : This is Ed. When we look at the second half of the year, on the RPU front, reduced storage and fuel surcharge revenues are going to persist. We've talked about that. I talked about that in our prepared remarks. Collectively, those current projections for us fuel storage and coal pricing is roughly $650 million. Mark George : Year-over-year revenue contraction. Ed Elkins : That's right. Mark George : So that's the headwind we're swimming against. Scott Group : 650 in what period? Mark George : Second half versus second half. Scott Group : Okay. That's revenue. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Chris Wetherbee : So maybe a little bit on hedge here. I guess I'm curious, how do we think about -- you talked about the pipeline of string new rolling kind of moderating in the back half of the year? So how do we think about actual employee levels in the back half of the year, maybe 3Q, 4Q? And then, Mark, in the past, you talked a little bit about OpEx and maybe putting the profit aside, I know obviously, there's RPU headwinds on the revenue piece. Is OpEx kind of flattish from where you were in the second quarter? Or is there an ability to actually improve on that given the network kind of reopening and getting some of that productivity back into the model? Alan Shaw : Why don't you address the question on conductor trainees and craft colleagues. Paul Duncan : Yes. Thanks, Alan. So as you saw on the -- hunting chart on the stats, we continue to make progress on staffing. And really, at this point, we plan to reduce the CT pipeline to around 600 or less as we continue to focus on attrition and filling in some of those remaining locations. But at this point, with what we've been able to do from a hiring standpoint, we have further leveraged and gained velocity across the network and facilitate having those folks that are at healthy locations send to some of those hotspots. And again, that is a contributor to the velocity improvements and the service improvements that we've seen here over the past several weeks that we expect to continue through the latter half of the year. Alan Shaw : And Paul, your guidance on a pipeline of around 600 is more pointed towards the end of the year. Paul Duncan : Correct. Correct. Mark George : And Chris, with regard to OpEx, I think we've obviously seen a step-up in our cost structure as we've been dealing with a lot of the service issues and trying to start to build some resiliency going forward. I think what you'll see now is emanation of those service-related costs as we go through the back half of the year. However, don't forget, we've got that 4% wage increase that took effect July 1. So, those kind of start to wash each other out. And with regard to some of the other P&L line items, in aggregate, probably flattish sequentially. We see those kind of holdings. So that's why the leverage is there now to take on to take on volume. We believe we've got the capacity to handle a lot of volume without much incremental cost and really gets down to facing these RPU headwinds that are going to provide pretty sizable headwind for us on the margin side, $650 million as we just touched on. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. And average heads are up a little bit in the back half of the year, I think is what I heard. Mark George : I'm sorry, can you repeat that? Chris Wetherbee : Average head count is going to be up a little bit sequentially in the back half of the year. Mark George : Yes, correct. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, please limit yourself to one question so we allow as many as possible to join us. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Jon Chappell : Mark, I thought Slide 7 was super helpful. And then also, you noted that there's volume, revenue and cost impacts that you wouldn't kind of strip out as being onetime in nature. Is there any way to quantify those two, let's call them, non-adjusted impacts to the second quarter results? And as we think about a return to normalization, is that kind of a slow grind as the line comes back on and builds the full capacity where you can be kind of on an apples-to-apples basis at the start of the fourth quarter? Or do you think that it's going to take all the way until 2024 to say kind of base revenue and base costs from the entire network. Mark George : Yes. So, the way we look at it, and we've done some analysis here with Ed and his team, we think we left about $175 million to $200 million of revenue behind because of the service disruptions and the shutdown of the line there in East Palestine. So, that's kind of on the revenue side. And on the cost side, we were dealing with growing a lot of costs and trying to accelerate the network, and we've done that successfully. So, now we're going to probably use the next six months to really work those costs off and get back to more productive levels of service. So, I think you'll see that those costs will wind down here in the third quarter. And I think by the fourth quarter, most of those costs will be removed from our system. So, we talk about probably $40 million to $45 million here in the second quarter of kind of poor service related costs, and that will start to unwind here. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Brian Ossenbeck : Maybe just go back to the average comp per employee. And Mark, you were talking about the 4% increase for the craft employees. Can you just give us a sense of what that looks like on an all-in basis because you've got over time, you've got mix, you got trainees in there. What does it look like in the back half of this year and how does that carry forward into next year? And then beyond that point, can you just talk more broadly about the cost for paid sick leave, what role changes and how we should think about those, including any potential offsets and when you might see them? Mark George : Thanks, Brian. So I think I guided earlier in the year to about 35,000 and change each quarter, anticipating that we were going to have this 4% step-up in rates in the third quarter, but that would be neutralized by the wind-down of service-related costs. So that guidance pretty much holds. I would -- if I were you all, I'd be modeling around 35 and change average comp per employee each quarter. Sorry, the second part of that one question was what? Brian Ossenbeck : The work rule changes... Mark George : Oh, yes. Sorry. Clearly, these things aren't free. So there's definitely a little bit of a headwind that we're swimming against with a lot of these work rule changes. I'm not going to put a fine number on it other than to say that, obviously, we're going to have to pay for that with some productivity initiatives in the future. And that's what Paul and his team are looking at now. But clearly, some short-term headwinds from a lot of what you've seen published. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Jordan Alliger : Sort of curious maybe from a sensitivity perspective, you've done a really good job getting the network back into shape in the second quarter. And you talked about maybe hopefully improving OR with some volume sequentially versus the second quarter OR. But I'm actually curious, is there -- given the headwinds you've talked about and maybe even looking into next year, is there a level of volume growth that needs to come into the network to show year-over-year OR improvement? Mark George : Well, I'll jump in and just say that you go back to our financial framework, our goal, the one we launched back in December, kind of -- we're aiming for mid-single-digit revenue growth on average in most years. And that would imply a few points at least of volume and a couple of points of pricing. So we think that, that is the right equation for us where we can then leverage it and drive productivity so that we have op income growth that's greater than the revenue growth. So, that's pretty much the model. And I would expect in '24 that to play out. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Ravi Shanker : Now that you've had a little more time to digest the aftermath of the accident, do you have a better sense of when we might know the final kind of financial impact here? Kind of is that 3Q event, is a 2024 event? Is it going to take several years? How does that play out? Alan Shaw : Mark, why don't you address that, please? Mark George : Sure. I mean, this is going to take a little bit more time. The way to look at this, Ravi, is as we've entered Q2, we've got a lot more visibility now than we did in Q1. And our current estimates assume that the cleanup activity continues into October and then kind of moderates meaningfully during the fourth quarter. Future periods are going to be impacted by ongoing legal costs and may be impacted by other items as well such as fines and penalties, which are currently unknown. And frankly, we can't estimate. So what I would encourage is that maybe you look at the 10-Q disclosures later today related to the matter, we kind of go into a fair amount of detail of the types of things that could continue to impact us in the future. And we'll continue to monitor this and keep you all apprised as things change. But right now, the largest part of what we're accruing for has really been the environmental cleanup costs. And the visibility now is we think as we get into October, things really start to wind down, and that's the basis of these estimates. Now I'll take a moment and just say, we've started the process, like I said in my prepared remarks of seeking recovery from third parties, and we are going to start here in the third quarter, making claims against our insurance -- making claims against our insurance policies. So that's going to take some time to play out. And we're probably talking quarters, not months. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens Inc. Please proceed with your question. Justin Long : We had another Class 1 rail yesterday come out and announced that they're pausing buyback activity for the second half. So I wanted to get your thoughts around buybacks as we move into the next couple of quarters? And any update on the timing of the Cincinnati Southern acquisition closing and how that deal will be funded? Mark George : Yes, thanks. We continue doing some share repurchasing in the second quarter similar levels to what we had done in the first. And again, we get back to what our model is and nothing changes. The first thing we do with our returns is reinvest back in the business to drive safety, resiliency, growth productivity. And this year, that is going to be $2.2 billion of CapEx spend. After that, we pay a dividend in that 35% to 40% payout ratio range. Sometimes it goes outside of that a little bit, but we'll grow back into it. And then with the remaining excess cash, we've been very mindful of our leverage, we return that cash to shareholders through the repurchase of shares. This year is a little unique in that we have signaled we're going to do that CSR purchase. The timing of that is also becoming clearer. That is likely toward the end of Q1 of next year of closing should the citizens vote affirmatively in Cincinnati to go forward. So we will be mindful of that because part of that purchase will be coming from internally generated cash flow. That doesn't mean we're stopping share repurchase, but it will definitely be at much lower levels than we've seen in the prior couple of years where we were doing $3 billion a year or more. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Kauffman : A lot of my questions has been answered, but let me ask this one because you threw it out earlier. You talked a little bit about bringing in first mile, last mile head. Now not the right time, we're focused on rehabbing the network and fixing what needs to be fixed. But could you talk a little bit about longer term why this makes a difference and why you're one of the few rails that's actually stepped in that direction? Alan Shaw : Ed, why don't you address that? Ed Elkins : Sure, I'd be glad to. We know from talking to our customers, and we've done this over a long period of time and spent a lot of time with our customers. First and last mile is a critical component of the customer experience. And we know that there are a few key vectors of value that we're going to be -- that we have to focus on delivering. Service quality is one of those. And first and last mile is a portion of service quality. It's also customer experience, it's also commercial sophistication. In all three of those categories, first and last mile plays a significant and substantial role. And it's not just in the merchandise business. It's also in our TBT or bulk transfer facilities. It's also with our third grade directed product. It's also with Triple Crown. So we view it as a key component of our future success. Alan Shaw : And it's all part of our long-term strategy to drive service, productivity and growth. Mark George : We've got to do different things if we want to grow. Yes. So this is a great example. Alan Shaw : Yes. And we're willing to take a lead role in the industry on that. Mark George : That's right. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Tom Wadewitz : So I wanted to ask you, I think you talked a little bit about maybe what you need on the volume side to -- or revenue side to improve OR. But I guess I'm thinking if you look, I don't know, into '24 or just let's say, beyond the next quarter or two, it does seem like you identified a pretty big revenue headwind in the second half. And I don't know that those revenues would come back in terms of storage or coal RPU and fuel surcharge, obviously, can be up or down. But I'm just -- and on the cost side, it doesn't seem like you're going to cut headcount. So is it just all about volume? And should we be optimistic about moving out of the mid-60s? Or is there an operating ratio? Or is there a challenge where you're kind of stuck in the mid-60s for a period of time on the operating ratio. It just seems hard to see what's going to move in a big way out of the mid-60s OR other than volume really being a lot better. Mark George : The single biggest lever we've got right now is to absorb volume growth into our current cost structure. So, that is really going to provide a bit of peel out from where we are today. And then I think at the same time, Paul and his team, in particular, are working hard on productivity initiatives because we've dug service out of the hole we were in, maybe not in the most productive way. We've been growing a lot of costs and resources to accelerate the network. So now there's a lot of opportunity to take the costs out and start driving productivity again. And that's what Paul and his team are heavily focused on. We're not going to give an OR projection here or the pace at which we're going to improve. There are a lot of levers. And you touched on most of them. RPU being a big piece. We'll see what happens here with coal pricing in the future. That's been a driver. The same thing with fuel. That's going to be -- it's been very supportive fuel to our OR in the first half, and it's going to be equally negative now here in the back half. So that dynamic could change going forward. So we're not in a position to project where the OR goes in the next 12 or 18 months. But I will tell you, we are coiled up with the investments we've made to start driving improvements by taking on volume. We are reading employees to take on volume. Tom Wadewitz : It just seems like the revenue headwinds are a lot bigger than the $45 million a quarter cost inefficiencies? Mark George : Yes. I mean we laid them out. There are some revenue RPU type of headwinds, but we do think that there is volume out there for the taking. And as long as we don't go into an economic downturn, which is we're feeling a little bit better about lately, we think there's some share recapture opportunity that's out there and other areas where we can take the volume on. But yes, we're going to have short-term headwinds. Alan Shaw : And look, as the service product has stabilized, it gives us the opportunity to continue to iterate our plan and drive productivity and efficiencies into the base plan as well. So it's not just the elimination of the service recovery cost. We're going to make the base plan better. And that's exactly what we're doing now, and that's the structure that Paul has built into his organization. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Allison Poliniak : Just going back to that $2.6 billion that you highlight on industrial development, is there a way to better understand how that converts to a potential volume opportunity for you. And I would say similarly with the EV battery plants per plan, is there a kind of an algorithm to think through in terms of the volume opportunity as they come online? Ed Elkins : I appreciate the question. I'm not sure, I think, in terms of algorithms for that stuff. The value of the product that we're delivering varies by the size of the project. And it could be months to manifest volume. It could be years depending on the size of the project. We're encouraged by the EV battery facilities that have located along our lines. But let me be also clear, we're encouraged by EV battery production or facilities that are not on our lines because being the largest producer we serve more auto plants than any other railroad. We're going to benefit from that off-line production as well. So I don't -- I think when we think through it, it is a multi-year manifestation of volume over time. Alan Shaw : Yes. I think the salient point is the macro trends in the economy play to the strengths of our unique franchise. That's why we have a lot of confidence moving forward. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Jason Seidl : Two quick things here. One, how should we think about sort of other income below the line, you guys did a great job of laying out sort of what you think about revenue, what you think about OR but there's a big swing year-over-year in other income, so just curious about second half? And Alan, any thoughts on potential regulation and maybe the recent steps by the FRA to do a public comment period on train size and weights. Mark George : Jason, other income, remember, a big driver of other income is the Company owned -- the returns on company-owned life insurance investments. And here in the first half, we had some pretty good compares because last year, in Q1, Q2, we had losses on those company-owned life insurance policies. So now, we've swung to returns again, which is historically long term, been the more normal. And so the $64 million or so in Q2, which is year-over-year compare on company-owned life insurance will probably not be as big in the back half. So, I'd get back to more back half numbers like you've seen historically in that $20 million to $30 million a quarter range. Alan Shaw : And Jason, with respect to your question about regulation, I've been fully engaged with our elected officials and our regulators, really advancing and offering my full throat in endorsement for a lot of the provisions that are in the various bills that are moving through the house or moving through the Senate. A lot of them make perfect sense to us or just they're commonsensical. I don't see anything out there right now that is going to be too onerous on the rail industry cost structure, which includes railroads or our customers. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna International Group. Please proceed with your question. Bascome Majors : Mark, you gave us a lot of color on the timing of recoveries versus spend and some of the issues with East Palestine. I think it would be helpful if you could kind of frame what you're feeling for free cash flow this year, and just ballpark, any amount that might be a shift into 2024? Or that's how we should look at it given that claims and recoveries will be ongoing and could take years? Thank you. Mark George : Yes, Bascom, it's really because of the timing with EP and the uncertainties around. I had mentioned that the accrued balance that sits there today, $287 million of cash has gone out. We've got over $800 million that we had accrued for. So the remaining $500-or-so million, half of that is going to come out in the back half of this year, the other half probably next year, some may slip into 2025 even. Beyond that, we have no visibility to the timing on recoveries. It's unlikely that we'll see any recoveries actually here in 2023. It's a matter of when in 2024, they start to come in. And we'll get back to, again, the insurance process where you can't really ask for insurance coverage on costs you've incurred until you actually incur the expense, meaning the cash goes out. So we're only just now starting to make those claims. So it is going to take several quarters probably before you go through the process and get the free cash flow benefit on the proceeds. Bascome Majors : Do you have any thoughts without really tying you to the timing of when those recoveries may or may not happen? What free cash flow could look like for the business this year? Mark George : I don't want to get into that level of guidance right here. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Nolan with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Ben Nolan : Yes. We've heard a little bit about the possibility of seeing some intermodal shifting back to the West Coast from the East Coast given the hopefully, normalization of labor over there. Curious if you guys have seen any initial signs of that at all or if you see that as a potential risk or not? Ed Elkins : I would say we haven't seen any real signs of it yet, but let's be clear. We have a network that's built for volume growth from the West as well as from the East, and we can benefit from freight that comes in either cost. Operator : Thank you. Our final question today comes from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. David Sanford : So is there a way to quantify the share loss in 2Q that has happened from the East Palestine derailment? I'm just trying to get a sense for some -- how much volume might have moved away related to the weaker macro? And then, Mark, is there a way to think about as you look forward to all the things that are potentially out there, obviously, we've accrued for a lot of things. We're going to get some recoveries. If we think about the net, the good guys versus the bad guys. Is there a way to think about whether the liability from this thing is going to net grow or maybe say constant or maybe shrink a little bit when you think about all the puts and takes on a multiyear view? Ed Elkins : This is Ed. I'll start. There's no doubt, we went through a tough stretch there with service that for some of our customers to find alternatives to keep their supply chains running. Those alternatives probably included additional inventory, truck substitution as well as other railroads. And I think Mark actually mentioned $175 million to $200 million in the quarter that we -- we wish we had back. I think that's a fair number. We work pretty closely on that. But we also know that our customers recognize the long-term benefit that we deliver. And I told you earlier that I'm already encouraged about the recent trajectory of our volumes. We're able to save our customers money, and they are looking forward for us doing that. We focused on two things during the quarter as we got service back. Number one, get it back as quickly as possible. And number two, make sure we stayed really close to our customers, so they knew that they could unwind those alternatives and come back to us. We think we're seeing that. Alan Shaw : Look, that's a central point to our long-term strategy and consistent service as consequences. And that we're going to make service -- competitive service, excellent service and enduring competitive strength for NS. Operator : Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Shaw for any final comments. Alan Shaw : Thank you for joining us this morning, and we look forward to further conversations at start of the third quarter. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to introduce Luke Nichols, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Nichols. You may now begin. Luke Nichols : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Please note that during today's call, we will make certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to future events or future performance of Norfolk Southern Corporation, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and may differ materially from actual results. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. Our presentation slides are available at nscorp.com in the Investors section, along with a reconciliation of any non-GAAP measures used today to the comparable GAAP measures. Turning to Slide 3; it's now my distinct honour to introduce Norfolk Southern's President and Chief Executive Officer, Alan Shaw. Alan Shaw : Good morning, and welcome to our discussion of third quarter earnings. Here with me are Mark George, our Chief Financial Officer; Paul Duncan, our Chief Operating Officer; and Ed Elkins, our Chief Marketing Officer. I want to begin by thanking my Norfolk Southern colleagues for working safely, serving our customers, and driving our strategic plan forward. When we charted a new course in the industry, we understood unlocking the full potential of our powerful franchise would require an enhanced focus on resilience and operational excellence across every aspect of our business. Our transformation into a more customer-centric, operations-driven service organization reveals opportunities to strengthen our franchise. We saw some of that in the third quarter with two technology outages. The first, on August 28, was caused by a defect in a vendor's software. The second, on September 29, involved a firmware maintenance issue. These incidents were unrelated and were not cybersecurity issues. We are taking measures to prevent a reoccurrence, and importantly, we are not stopping there. We have launched a top-to-bottom review of our technology infrastructure with the assistance of leading third-party experts. Operations driven means pursuing operational excellence in every aspect of our business and that includes IT. Demonstrating our progress in building resiliency, our strengthened operations leadership, enhanced operating plan and greater crew capacity enabled us to manage the technology incidents with limited disruption to our customers and grow volume through the service recovery. Throughout the third quarter, we continued to do exactly what we said we'd do when we announced our strategy. We are making smart investments and safe, reliable and resilient service. Although the macroeconomic environment of abnormally low volumes is an unwelcome headwind, it has not changed our approach or diminished our confidence that our strategy is a better way forward. The market will recover and we will be poised and leveraged to capture growth with strong incremental margins. Mark will provide detail on other cost drivers in the quarter including fuel prices and higher labor costs as a result of last year's historic wage increase for our craft colleagues. These costs combined with investments in our strategy and the backdrop of historically low volumes in the quarter contributed to significant pressure on our operating ratio, which deteriorated year-over-year and sequentially. We are clearly not satisfied with these results. We will recover from these short-term impacts to our operating ratio. As we articulated when we launched our strategy, continuous productivity improvement is a core element of our balanced approach. We are committed to achieving and maintaining industry competitive margins over the long term. Our focus on productivity is unrelenting. Under the strong leadership of Paul and his team in operations, we have an increasingly stable network with a high degree of plan compliance allowing us to iterate the plan for service and productivity and as Paul will describe, we are reducing our pipeline of conductor trainees through year-end to more normal levels among other steps. Balanced against the challenges of the quarter, there were several encouraging developments that demonstrate progress on our strategy and point to growth and profit improvement in the quarters ahead. Notably, service in the third quarter improved both year-over-year and sequentially, allowing us to onboard more business. Volume improved as well and appears to have turned a corner with each of the last four weeks running above 136,000 carloads. That's a level we haven't seen consistently since the second quarter of 2022. In part, this was a function of customers awarding us new business. Our customers see the commitment we are making to deliver more consistent, reliable service and our marketing team is creating innovative solutions to amplify the value of that service, even in a weak freight environment. Ed will talk more about this later. In addition to service and volume gains, we delivered improvements in safety as well. Our mainline train accident rate is down more than 40% year-over-year as we strengthen our safety culture and performance. In East Palestine and the surrounding communities, we continue to deliver on our commitments. Mark will provide an update on costs associated with our ongoing efforts to make things right. I visit regularly as we make significant progress cleaning the site and investing in the community's future. I'll now turn it over to Mark. Mark George : Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 5 with an update on our accruals related to the Eastern Ohio derailment. We are pleased to report that we will be completing soil removal from the derailment site shortly, but expect that there will be ongoing testing efforts to ensure continued safety of the air, soil and water through April of 2024. And as such, we accrued $118 million in Q3 to account for this timeline extension. Additionally, we recorded another $70 million for legal and other costs incurred in the quarter. Of note, we did file our initial claim for reimbursement with our insurers during the third quarter and will continue to file claims as costs accumulate. We did receive notification of our first reimbursement under our policy of $25 million and accordingly recognize this as an offset to the costs incurred in the third quarter. The cash was actually received last week. While we were encouraged by the speed of this initial reimbursement, there are dozens of parties sharing exposure at 10 layers in the insurance tower. So we expect this cost recovery process to be protracted. Also, of the $966 million recorded as expense thus far, just more than half has been paid through September 30. Of the remaining $450 million, I'd expect roughly half to be spent in the fourth quarter and the rest to be spent in 2024. I will remind you that this situation remains fluid and we will continue working through these issues for many quarters to come. We expect that there will be additional costs that have not yet been incurred related to future settlements, fines and penalties, as well as legal fees, and we cannot predict the amounts at this time. Moving to Slide 6, where we illustrate the impact of these third quarter costs on our results; our GAAP results are in the first row, while on row 2, we isolate the accounting to our Q3 financials related to the incident and our response. At the bottom of the chart, you'll note the comparisons of the adjusted financial results to the prior year. I'll be talking about our adjusted results for the remainder of the discussion. Revenues were down 11%, adjusted operating expense was down modestly, the adjusted operating ratio for Q3 was 69.1%, which notably includes 270 basis points of headwind from net fuel price impacts. On an adjusted basis, operating income was down 28%, net income and EPS were down 37% and 35% respectively, but recall last year, we enjoyed a benefit from a state income tax change of $136 million, distorting the year-over-year comparison. Let's turn to Slide 7 for an overview of our operating revenues; and it's a quick look at the drivers of the revenue change from last year in advance of Ed getting into the market details. The biggest driver in the year-over-year revenue decline is the meaningful reduction in fuel surcharge revenue. Volumes were down 2%, which equates to a $74 million revenue decline and we are highlighting here the reduction in intramodal storage revenue of $71 million, as we are now back to more normal levels and will continue to have tough compares through Q1 of 2024. Ed will talk later about the traction we have on pricing as well as mix dynamics in the quarter that collectively inform the positive $27 million of rate mix and other. On Slide 8, let's drill into the operating expenses. Adjusted operating expenses for the quarter were down $19 million, or 1%, on a year-over-year basis. Fuel expense was down $94 million, or 25%, driven mainly by lower fuel prices. Comp and ben was down $20 million, or 3% year-over-year, as higher pay rates and employee levels were offset by a favorable comparison with Q3 last year from the $85 million charge we took related to the retroactive wage accruals. Depreciation expense was up in line with our earlier guidance. Purchase services was up due to higher costs associated with engineering activities on our network, as well as technology spend. The increase in materials and other was up $42 million and driven primarily by an adverse comp on a favorable legal settlement last year, as well as higher consumption of materials for locomotive repairs. Property sales were also lower this quarter. Moving to Slide 9, while we expect costs related to the past service issues to begin unwinding in the third quarter, additional service challenges in the quarter resulted in a delay with only moderate easing. We expect the unwind to accelerate here in the fourth quarter. Now, offsetting these fourth-quarter savings will be an increase in incremental costs related to building resiliency in a couple key areas that will pay dividends in the years ahead. Firstly, there are investments in the continuation of our hiring and locomotives in order to support both future growth and faster recoveries. Second are the investments in our craft workforce, including the quality of life enhancements like paid sick leave. These investments overall should allow for the accommodation of higher volumes that will help cover these costs along with more productivity. And on Slide 10, let's talk to a couple P&L items below operating income. Other income was up $42 million in the quarter, driven by favorable returns from our company-owned life insurance. The adjusted effective tax rate was 22.7% in line with what we normally guide. And turning to free cash flow and shareholder distribution on Slide 11, through the first nine months, free cash flow was $1.1 billion lower than prior year, with half due to derailment-related expenditures and the remainder from a combination of lower core operating results and higher CapEx. Shareholder distributions over the same nine months were $1.4 billion, thanks to our solid dividend and continued share repurchase activity. I will remind that the citizen vote in Cincinnati to approve the proposed $1.6 billion purchase of the CSR asset will take place in November. So we are reserving capital capacity for that potential transaction, which would close in mid-March of 2024. I'll now hand off to Paul to provide an update on our operations. Paul Duncan : Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. At Norfolk Southern, everything starts with safety, so let's turn to Slide 13 for an update. In the quarter, we have made significant strides. Our injury rate is up slightly versus last year, but it has improved 30% from where we were just three years ago. Our accident rate is trending down from where we have been the past two years, and we also continue to maintain a significant reduction in our mainline accident rate through the many efforts and initiatives we have put forth, including the enhancements to our train-maker rules implemented earlier this year. While those enhancements required a significant period of operational adjustment earlier this year, they are now paying off in terms of our mainline accident rate improvement. We also remain very focused on reducing exposures and improving outcomes in our yard and terminal operations. We have made further investments in our people, including enhancements to our training and PPE programs, as well as leadership development. On all of these fronts, the results are encouraging, but we are not satisfied and will continue to drive towards our goal of being the industry leader in safety. Turning to Slide 14 for an update on service; this is another area where we have made sustained progress this last quarter. Train speeds have resumed the improving trajectory they were on before our challenging second quarter. We have also pushed to reduce dwell and improve schedule rigor in our terminals, which well now improved to its best level in two years. We're sustaining this progress in October while bringing weekly car loadings up to their highest level since Q2 2022, and while developing new service offerings that Ed will outline. As part of our scheduled railroad model though, we will drive further progress. We have to continue to minimize car dwell, maximize velocity across the railroad, sustain safe, reliable and resilient service and drive productivity. On the next two slides, we will cover how we plan to accomplish this. Turning to Slide 15, our locomotive velocity was flat year-over-year. Now that we are seeing improvements in train velocity and terminal dwell, this is an opportunity we are focused on driving further velocity and productivity in. As our terminal discipline initiatives take further hold and as network velocity takes the next step above 21 miles per hour, we expect to see this metric improve along with fuel efficiency as we bring additional tonnage onto the network. We now have a qualified teeny workforce that is sized appropriately in aggregate, although we are still investing to get them all in the right locations. We're on track to have our conductor training pipeline below 600 by yearend as indicated last quarter. As our initiatives take hold and as GTMs increase, this measure of productivity will improve from here. Moving to Slide 16 to discuss how we are driving service improvement aligned with our scheduled railroad model and how it will translate it into additional gains in resilience, productivity and ultimately growth. First is disciplined terminal execution. This starts with strict adherence to the operating plan to ensure trains are arriving on plan to balance terminal flows in both our merchandise yards and intermodal facilities. We're minimizing dwell by switching cars within six hours of arrival. At our intermodal facilities, it's ensuring we're driving precision execution to the trip plan of containers and leveraging our high frequency intermodal model. It involves maximizing connection performance, getting the right cars on the right train and departing our trains on time. The second bullet point, we are driving a culture of strict compliance to the operating plan, both at the train, car, and intermodal unit level and expect that this will drive further reductions in dwell and even greater consistency in our terminals. Next, we're investing in our people and modernizing our workforce to become more resilient and productive. For example, 250 conductors are receiving locomotive engineer training this year. This gives us resilience and flexibility to fill assignments whether the need is an engineer or a conductor or protecting future growth with an investment today. We are moving forward with the first phase of extra board consolidations, cross training 260 employees at seven key terminals across the network. Let me explain what this is. As railroads and labor agreements evolved and merged over the decades, territorial boundaries remained that prevented certain employees from working assignments that were within their geography. At many of these locations we've worked collaboratively with labor to remove those boundaries but have yet to get folks qualified to work all potential assignments. With our new focus on resilience, we're investing in our craft employees and getting them qualified to hold more assignments, providing them with greater work opportunities and offering Norfolk Southern enhanced operational flexibility and efficiency. To complement these labor modernization efforts, we are implementing predictable work scheduling, a groundbreaking work-life balance initiative negotiated with our craft colleagues, which will also streamline our back office crew management functions and drive further productivity. Lastly we are kicking off a system-wide initiative that will drive productivity and enhance our first mile last mile service. This is a substantial initiative aligned with delivering reliable service, productivity and most importantly driving additional growth of the network. To close, running a safe reliable and resilient scheduled railroad using these principles is going to improve service consistency, generate greater productivity and create capacity for growth. I'll now turn the call over to Ed. Ed Elkins : Thanks Paul and good morning to everybody on the call. Now before we get into the numbers, I want to call out the collaboration between our teams and marketing and operations as we improve service and innovate solutions to deliver value for our shareholders and for our customers. I'll talk about it more as we move along here, but I think it's important to recognize the steady progress that we're seeing deep in these organizations that's starting to pay off. Let's start on Slide 18 and review our results for the third quarter. Norfolk Southern volumes and revenue was down 2% and 11% respectively year-over-year in the third quarter. Revenue declines, outpaced volume due to lower fuel surcharge and intermediate storage revenue compared to the prior period. Within merchandise, weakness in several energy markets was the leading driver of a 3% decline in total volume. Crude oil shipments were challenged by unfavorable fuel price differentials that discouraged crude by rail to East Coast refineries that we serve. Also, low natural gas prices negatively impacted shipments of sand and NGLs. Helping to offset those declines in energy markets was strength in automotive where volume increased 7% year-over-year in the third quarter. Growth was driven by continued strength and demand for finished vehicles as well as high shippable ground counts. Merchandise revenue was down 7% due to lower revenue from fuel surcharge and lower volume. However, revenue per unit excluding fuel set a new record as it improved 3% showing sustained price and mix improvement. This quarter marks 33 quarters out of the last 34 consecutive quarters where we've been able to achieve year-over-year growth in merchandise revenue per unit excluding fuel. Moving on to intermodal, volume was down slightly compared with last year as growth in international intermodal largely offset declines in domestic. On the domestic side, persistently abundant truck capacity and weak freight demand challenged volume. While on the international side, volume improved as customers continued to return freight to IPI service. Intermodal revenue was down 22% as revenue per unit excluding fuel declined 15%. Lower intermodal storage fees represented more than two-thirds of this decline, followed by adverse mix effects from strong international volumes and the impact of persistent competitive pressure in a loose trucking environment. We're also seeing negative mix effects within the international business. First, shippers are returning to lower yielding short haul lanes that shifted to the highway during the pandemic and second, growth in lower yielding empty shipments is also outpacing loaded shipments. Intermodal storage has returned to a normal level and we expect a lap this headwind in the second quarter of next year. Lastly, within coal, volume dropped 9% year-over-year with weak conditions in our utility markets, which more than offset strength in our export markets. Utility coal volume was down roughly 26% from prior year levels driven by high stock piles and low natural gas prices and prolonged customer and producer outages. Export volume increased year-over-year driven by strong Asian demand. Coal revenue declined 8% primarily due to lower volume. Revenue per unit excluding fuel set a new record and revenue per unit also increased as positive mix and stronger than expected seawarm coal pricing and modest liquidated damages more than offset a decline in fuel surcharge revenue. Turning to slide 19, for the fourth quarter, we expect to see slow volume recovery amid uncertain economic conditions. September presented us with some encouraging data that the contraction in manufacturing is slowing and onshoring to the US is on the rise. However, we remain cautious in our optimism as uncertainty surrounding future Fed actions, strike outcomes and geopolitical tension is very pronounced. Although the macro environment is unclear, we are steadfast in our business development initiatives and I'll talk about those in a few minutes. Our merchandised markets have upside potential in the automotive and metals markets. We expect growth in automotive as we continue to work through the backlog of shippable vehicles, improve our cycle times and grow our fleet size. We also still see unmet demand in our metals market, which we should realize as improving service should drive year-over-year growth. Offsetting anticipated growth in the fourth quarter will be sustained, soft conditions in energy markets as the headwinds that pressured crude, NGL and sand volumes in the third quarter are expected to continue through the remainder of the year. Automotive production is a key driver for many of our merchandised markets beyond automotive, so the duration and scope of the ongoing UAW strike is a downside risk to our overall merchandise volumes. Our marketing and operations teams are collaborating to deliver incremental business wins across the portfolio of carload markets that we serve by identifying and solving business challenges for our customers at an accelerating pace. This innovation and collaboration will be a driver of future growth for NS. Intermodal volume is expected to improve year-over-year in the fourth quarter from sustained service recovery and improving market conditions. We're encouraged by the momentum that we're seeing in our domestic market. Our customers are seeing improvements in bid compliance and demand, which has us trending positively in October, but we continue to see a relatively muted peak season which will temper overall volumes. International markets will benefit from strong East Coast import demand and favorable ocean rates driving demand for IPI. We expect the negative mix effects from the shift back to short haul lanes to persist in the fourth quarter, and we continue to experiment and develop new services for our intermodal customers, and I'll talk about that in just a minute. Coal volumes should be stable in the fourth quarter with upside potential in export markets as new production comes online. In addition, recent trends in seaborne coal prices suggest higher prices throughout the remainder of the year due to supply constraints out of Australia as well as continued strong demand out of China and India. Domestic coal shipments should improve sequentially in the fourth quarter on improved service and fewer outages, but headwinds from low natural gas prices will continue to be a limiting factor and while uncertainty in the economy continues to persist, we're confident in our ability to collaborate with our customers to drive incremental volume and to continue providing value in a manner that drives growth in the future. Now before I turn it back to Alan, I would like to expand briefly on how we're providing value in ways that drive growth in an unfavorable market. Slide 20 features key examples of new service offerings we developed this quarter aimed at making Norfolk Southern the preferred option for freight transportation and driving modal conversion. It's important to recognize that collaboration and teamwork invested by both marketing and operations to bring these projects to life. In October, we partnered with CN to expand intermodal service and connect customers in Atlanta and Kansas City with markets on the CN in Canada. We also partnered with Florida East Coast Railway to expand both domestic and international intermodal services in Florida. These new services are designed to give our customers flexibility, expand the reach of the NS intermodal network into key growth markets, and give more ways for our customers to reduce their supply chain greenhouse gas emissions. Early in September, we also announced an investment in DrayNow, a company focused on modernizing technology solutions for intermodal. DrayNow is revolutionizing intermodals' first and final mile journey through an app that provides customers with real-time shipment tracking and document capture of drayage shipments. Norfolk Southern is the operator of the most extensive intermodal network in the Eastern US and together with DrayNow and our best-in-class customers, we will drive more transparency into a fragmented supply chain and increase the ability to best serve our intermodal customers. And lastly, our persistent industrial development efforts paid off as both new and expanded industries turned on additional volume in the third quarter, including a new cement transload, an ethanol terminal, and a container board warehouse, as well as expanded rail operations and an established grain elevator. We'd like to thank our customers for locating on our network and allowing NS to serve their market needs. Together, these diverse projects will generate over 7,800 new car loads annually at full production. We're aggressively pursuing project-oriented growth to enhance the NS network in a fragile freight environment. We're not sitting back and waiting for car loads to come to us, but rather we are proactively making enhancements to our service portfolio to become a preferred service provider for our customers and drive sustainable and smart growth in the future. And concluding on Slide 21, let's look at our 2023 outlook. Based on lower Q3 revenue, which included significantly lower fuel surcharge, we're now expecting 2023 revenue to be down closer to 4% year over year. With that, I'll turn it back over to Alan to bring us home. Alan Shaw : Closing on Slide 22, although this year has presented a number of challenges, we are emerging a stronger company due to our response and our decisive action to effect necessary improvements. I'm more confident than ever that our innovative strategy is a better way forward. We are already seeing the benefits from leadership changes, plan refinements and resource investments as we drive towards our strategy. We are achieving wins with our customer base, and we are incorporating operational discipline that drives consistency and enables productivity enhancements in the quarters ahead. I am extremely optimistic about our future. We will now open the call to questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question and answer session. [Operator instructions] And our first question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Chris Wetherbee : Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. I guess maybe we want to start on Slide 9. Mark, you laid out some of the temporary service costs and the incremental resiliency investments that you're making. I guess I want to make sure I understand how to think about that as we move into the fourth quarter, and then also really more 2024. I guess, are you able to absorb these costs and generate sequential OR improvement in the fourth quarter? And then as you look out to next year, how much of this cost kind of sticks around? How much of it actually will go away and any thoughts around the cadence of that? So thanks for that. Mark George : Okay, thanks, Chris. Yeah, so if you start first on the service costs, we saw a slight reduction here in the third quarter. We were hoping for a little bit more, but obviously we had some disruptions to the network that delayed that. We do expect the reduction to continue here in the fourth quarter, and eventually this should unwind over the next couple quarters. As fluidity on the network improves, as we qualify more of our T&Es in the right critical locations as well, and we start to build some solid processes around delivering service as opposed to putting the band-aids on, like we are today with overtime, etcetera. So those will start to unwind here in the next couple quarters. The right-hand part of that slide, those are -- I think you need to think about those as structural cost increases. And those are really around developing and building resiliency. That's the whole point. A lot of this is related to the T&E ramp-up that we've seen as well as the investments in our locomotives. There are also costs related to the quality of life improvements that we've announced with our craft workforce and I'd say that of these costs, 75% of those will probably reside in the comp and band line, and then after that you'll see costs sitting in purchase services and also in some materials. But in terms of cadence as we go into Q4, like I said, service costs will start to come down, but that will be offset by another increase there in the structural resiliency costs.by another increase there in the structural resiliency cost. And then I think at that point, we should probably be moderating going forward into '24, but we'll give you more '24 guidance when we reconvene in January. Alan Shaw : And Chris, one way to look at this is, our investments in resiliency are investments in the elimination of the service recovery costs and it's also an investment in top-tier growth and in industry competitive margins. That's our vision for the future and that's what we said we were going to do when we laid this out in December of last year. Mark George : Yeah. Ultimately, these are going to get paid for by the elimination of those temporary service costs, but also by accommodating more volume than we typically would be able to, as well as, pricing and productivity. So it's exaggerated here because we're in a down cycle. Chris Wetherbee : And does this give you the ability to improve OR in fourth quarter still? Mark George : Yeah, I think we're at a trough. I think we're at a trough right here. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Pleased proceed with your question. Amit Mehrotra : Thanks, operator. Hi, guys. Maybe first question, can you just give us the liquidated damages in coal and where we think coal yields can trend from the high 3Q levels? And, Alan, just a bigger picture question, every rail right now has a cyclical challenge. Everybody has a fuel headwind. You guys are still reporting margins that are 600 basis points, 700 basis points worse than your direct competitor and just generally industry. I look at that as an opportunity because obviously with top SPG you've fixed the network, you're improving the service, the volumes are coming. So there's obviously progress made there, but is there an opportunity to look deeper inside the cost structure of the organization to say, listen, we're dealing with all these headwinds just like all our competitors are, but we're still our cost structure is still seemingly very, very high and what's the opportunity there if you're looking at it and how you're going about addressing those differences? Thank you. Alan Shaw : Amit, thank you for that question. Why don't I address the second part of your one question first and then turn it over to Ed and talk about coal yields. Look, we're committed to industry competitive margins. We said that from the get-go. We've also said that returns follow the investment. We're investing over the long term and we're not going to chase short-term OR targets. We illustrated very clearly, Mark had a chart, I believe, at Investor Day that showed during a economic trough, right, our margins would get a little worse as we invested over the long term, but as you evaluate this through an economic cycle, this is the better way forward for Norfolk Southern to invest in long-term growth, deliver top-tier growth, industry competitive margins, and drive long-term shareholder value. We're not happy with our cost structure right now. As we drive operational discipline into our network, as we refresh our operations team, as we drive a high degree of plan compliance, it allows us to continue to iterate the plan for productivity and service and that's exactly what we're doing right now. Ed, you want to talk about gold yields? Ed Elkins : Sure. Yeah. I think you asked about LDs in the quarter and I think I said in the prepared remarks, these are episodic. We don't expect them to continue. Its high single digits in terms of millions of dollars and when we look out into the fourth quarter, and again, restating what I said in the prepared remarks, we're forecasting prices to be sideways through the end of the quarter and the year and that's really predicated off the continuation of strong demand out of India and China for next quarter. Amit Mehrotra : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Ken Hoexter : Hey, great. Good morning and Ed, solid job on the new lanes. Interesting stuff. Alan, I just want to follow up on that question maybe a little bit more, right? So you have a lot of temporary costs and restructuring costs. Do you think you need to bring in PSR expertise to handle some of that network resiliency? That seems to be the thing that PSR does, right? It allows the quick snapback, at least for some of the peers that have implemented that process. And I'm a little confused on the resiliency investments. It sounded like when Mark went through some of them, is it paid sick leave or is there more on the resiliency expenditures? I just want to understand what's outside of agreements or costs that you've already implemented on the resiliency side. Thanks. Alan Shaw : Yeah. Well, thank you, Ken. Look, I've been CEO for a year and a half. We've been kinetic here. We've refreshed our operations leadership. We've implemented a new operating plan. We've launched a brand new strategy, something that's never been done in this industry. We've revamped the marketing organization. We brought in a number of outsiders and leadership roles; outsiders to the rail industry, outsiders to Norfolk Southern. I believe we've got the right team going forward. We will continue to look for opportunities to improve our strategic talent base. With respect to the resiliency costs, some of that has to do with predictable work schedules. Some of that has to do with the historic wage increase that the rail industry and labor came to agreement on last year. Some of it has to do with hiring or investing in additional resources and as a result of that, what you're seeing is third quarter service is better year over year and better sequentially. Our safety figures improved in the third quarter and our volume growth right now, our volumes the last four weeks are at levels that we haven't seen in the last, say, second quarter of last year. So we are making progress. We're doing exactly what we said we're going to do. This is the better way forward for Norfolk Southern to drive long-term shareholder value. Ed Elkins : And Ken, just to put a fine point on the resiliency expense, about a third of that cost in the third quarter is related to the quality of life benefits, which are essentially paid sick leave. That has a cost to it. And the rest is really around the headcount additions for primarily T&E, but also some mechanical staff and then the rest is locomotive investments as well to be able to accommodate and accelerate the network. Thanks for the question. Operator : Our next question is in the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Scott Group : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Mark, I wasn't sure what you were trying to say on overall cost, ex fuel in Q4 versus Q3, so if you have any color there. And then, Al, I just want to go back to that big picture question. You've been clear and consistent with your message. We're not going to chase short-term OR, but long-term we want to have industry competitive margin. I guess my question is, what does 2024 look like in that short-term versus long-term view? Like, are we committed to margin improvement next year? Are we committed to starting to narrow this margin gap next year, because it is getting pretty wide right now. So I just want to know, when do we start to see it get to industry competitive again? Alan Shaw : Mark, you want to address the first one? Mark George : Oh, yeah. Sorry. Scott, look, I think the way you look at cost, ex fuel, to answer your specific question, it should be largely sideways and then, you sprinkle in the nice uptick we've seen in volumes. I think we've definitely probably troughed here in Q3, and we should see sequential margin improvement. Model out what you think that volume is going to be as we navigate through the quarter, and we report our volumes and you can pretty much assign traditional incremental margin rate to that. So I think we've troughed here in Q3, and it should improve from there. Alan Shaw : And Scott, with respect to industry competitive margins, we are committed to it. We're committed to it over the long term. Now, what we'll see is that as service continues to improve, we'll have greater opportunity to eliminate the service recovery cost. We'll have greater opportunity to drive productivity throughout our organization as we standardize our operating practices. We'll have greater opportunity to generate more volume. We'll have greater opportunity to generate more price, reflecting the value of the product that we sell and all of those things will contribute to improvements in our margins and industry competitive margins and I think we're going to see improvement in that next year. Scott Group : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Tom Wadewitz : Yeah, good morning. So I think it seems fairly clear that it's not so much a cost story, but it's much more volume and a revenue story that you need to drive that margin improvement and correct me if you think I'm wrong on that, but the question is really, what do you think is necessary to really get that revenue story improving? I think we look at the intermodal revenue per car was pretty weak in the quarter. I know there's some mix, but how do you think about that intermodal revenue strengthening? Is that mix going to improve over a couple quarters? Do we really need to see some tightening in the truckload market? I know a lot of your business is truck competitive, so is that something that truck rates are key. Just maybe if you could offer some thoughts, I guess intermodal on that revenue per car, but broader thoughts on '24, what should we be looking for to really potentially drive that revenue story stronger? Alan Shaw : Yeah, Tom, to be clear, this is a balanced approach. It's not just about revenue growth. We will continue to drive productivity into our organization. I'm committed to that. Our improved service product is going to help us with productivity. Our improved service product is going to help us attract more volume. Our improved service product is going to help us price to the value of our product. So there's a lot of value in there as we continue to invest in network resiliency long term. Ed, why don't you talk about what you're seeing in the market itself? Ed Elkins : Sure. It's a really important question that I appreciate you asking and we want to unpeel the onion here and make sure that everybody understands. First of all, let me say, year to date, we are positive in our core pricing in every single market we serve, okay. Now, let's dig into intermodal. The largest impact once we stripped fuel out was a decline in our intermodal storage revenue. We knew that that was going to happen. And as I think I said in the prepared remarks, that storage figure accounts for over two-thirds of the RPU decline that we saw in the quarter and then we had a couple other things that were very important for folks to understand. We had substantial negative mix in the quarter, and that comes in two forms. The first is international shipments grew while domestic shipments were very anemic given the amount of pressure that's out there in the truckload market. Our domestic shipments have a higher yield than international, so this was a substantial headwind. We also saw negative mix in two different ways within our international business. First of all, we're seeing much higher growth in short haul lanes, and those are lanes that really shifted to the highway during the pandemic and then are now rolling back to us. 85% of the growth in the third quarter in international came from those short haul lanes, and those are intrastate lanes, so it's very important to understand that. Lastly, the amount of empties that we moved is, frankly, much faster-paced growth than the lows that we saw. That is another decrimental pressure on RPUs. So a lot going on there. The truck market continues to be loose. I think the cash rate index has been down for 21 straight months. Contract rates on the highway peaked in March of last year. There's a lot of downward pressure, but here's what I'm confident of. Number one, I'm confident that the market in general will rotate back to growth. It always does. The excess capacity that's on the highway will evacuate. It always does and Norfolk Southern is going to be really well positioned, exceptionally well positioned to take advantage of not only the volume increases, but also the opportunity to reprice. Operator : Our next question is in the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Brian Ossenbeck : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. It may be a two-parter for Ed. Can you just give us an update? I think last time you mentioned that the $650 million headwind in the back half of the year for coal and accessorials or intermodal storage fees. Is that sort of still tracking in line with expectations? And then secondly to your point about core pricing, can you just give a little more color on where that is relative to inflation? I think we have seen a decent disconnect in terms of just the core pricing realization for Norfolk and for some of the industry in terms of how that trended versus inflation, which is higher than expected. So when do you expect to really sort of catch up with that? Is there something structural that's been keeping it lower than what we would have anticipated? Or is this more a matter of timing with contracts, repricing and service? How do you expect that rolling forward? Alan Shaw : Well, let me try to answer both of those. First one, I think you were asking about some of the known headwinds that we had coming in the second half and if they're intact. And I would say yes. We've seen the storage revenue really normalized to pre-pandemic levels and that's persisted and it's been very consistent throughout most of the year. We all know what fuel's doing. On that storage piece, we expect to lap that probably second quarter of next year and so that's going to be a headwind until then. Coal pricing is a surprise to the upside and we'll see where it goes from here. So that's sort of the known pieces of this. On the core pricing side, I think it's probably worth reviewing, what our strategy is and that's, number one, we're always compelled to deliver a competitive price in the marketplace that our customers can recognize value in, but we define that by long-term contract pricing, not by what's going on in the spot markets. That recipe over time has generated above-rail inflation pricing for many, many quarters now. We're confident that it will in the future. Okay, it's a very unusual truck market right now. We know that. But on our merchandise business in particular, we recognize our mid-single-digit pricing in this quarter and again, we're positive for price here today. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Justin Long from Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Justin Long : Thanks and good morning. Last quarter, you talked about $175 million to $200 million of lost revenue from the operational disruptions associated with East Palestine. Any updated thoughts on the timing of when this revenue can be recovered? I'm curious if that's something that could be driving some of the improvement in volumes and then on the two tech outages, any way you can quantify the impact you've seen from those thus far? Alan Shaw : Ed, why don't you talk about revenue outlook and the cadence? Ed Elkins : Sure. As service improves, and it is improving both sequentially and year-over-year. Our customers are very encouraged by that, and they're telling us that. That improvement in service is going to bring freight back to Norfolk Southern. We know our customers are very sophisticated supply chain managers and purchasers and when we're not on plan, they have to make other plans to keep their factories running. Some of our customers are going to see that value faster and as we cycle equipment faster, they're immediately going to be able to load more revenue onto Norfolk Southern. I think of markets like metals, like automotive, even though there is a strike right now, I think of that in the construction market and the aggregates market and some of the more flexible freight markets, we have to demonstrate persistent value in the form of reliable, sustainable service over a longer period of time, but we're making sure that our customers are well aware of our progress. Alan Shaw : Yeah, with respect to the tech outages, really, the revenue impact was largely inconsequential. It was more of a service issue and a cost issue associated with the slower network and the recruits. Really, what it does for us is it reaffirms the importance in investing in the resiliency of our network so we can weather anything that comes at us. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jonathan Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Jonathan Chappell : Thank you. Ed, Alan pointed out you've had four weeks now of volumes that have been back to the 2Q '22 levels, but it seems like you still have a lot of red traffic lights or yellow traffic lights on the freight category that you laid out in your slides. How much can we see acceleration if some of those traffic lights turn in your favor? This run rate that you've had the last four weeks seems to be kind of a catch-up and service-related, but if you get a macro tailwind behind you, what can those levels go to with the service operating at the levels that it is today? Alan Shaw : I'm going to try to be very tight with this answer. Number one, we're really glad to see a peak season happen this year, and we're encouraged by that. Our services allow us to deliver that. This network is built for a lot more freight than we're handling right now and as our customers recognize and are able to deliver that value to their customers, we're going to be able to handle a lot more freight. I'm confident in that. The fact is, and this is the last thing I'll say on it, economic uncertainty and geopolitical uncertainty are very high right now and I think we see that in the headlines every single day and it's just something that we have to keep in mind. That's probably why some of those lights are colored the way they are right now. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Allison Poliniak : Hi, good morning. I just want to go back to Intermodal and I would say the share recapture there. I know you talked about service and you talked about sort of that time to sort of regain that confidence. Is that something you're starting to see now or hear now from your customers where we could see that start to accelerate in the next few months despite what's going on in the overall macro Intermodal market? Just any thoughts there on your opportunities set for that? Alan Shaw : Well, you're right. We are seeing volume come back and I can't say enough about the quality of the customers that we have in our portfolio. We're very lucky to have our customers. They are certainly best in class. They're out on the street everyday converting freight from the highway to Norfolk Southern and it's because we're able to offer value that they can demonstrate to those customers. So, yes, I think that we have the opportunity here to deliver additional value to our shareholders in the form of more volume, more revenue, particularly from the Intermodal market. We have a network that's really built for that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Brandon Oglenski : Hey, good morning and thanks for taking the question. Alan, I think in response to a question earlier, you talked about standardizing operating practices across the network as you look into next year. Maybe I'm mischaracterizing what you said, but I guess can you put that in context for us? I thought the op plan had been set. You guys had learned the changes from the train makeup rules, but maybe there's more to come. Alan Shaw : Yeah, that's been an ongoing effort by Paul and his team to standardize the operating practices within our terminals, which allows us to drive further productivity and further capacity improvements and further service improvements. And that's just part of, you know, the PSR principles. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Jordan Alliger : Yeah, hi. Just a follow-up, with Velocity and Dwell recovering so well of late, is there a way to assess, how much of that comes from the better operations, the changes you've made there versus adding the headcount to get it closer to where you need to be? And do we think about headcount sort of flatlining from here on out, roughly? Thanks. Alan Shaw : Yeah, Jordan, we've always said that service is a function of leadership, plan and resources. We've refreshed our leadership within operations. We've implemented a new plan and we're driving a high degree of compliance to the plan. And we're investing in resources, whether that's additional T and E employees, cross-training conductors to become engineers or investing in quality of life issues. Those are all generating results for us, and you can see that with the service metrics. You can see that with the volume metrics as well. Mark, you want to talk about overall headcount? Mark George : Yeah, the headcount certainly helps. We've augmented in a lot of our critical locations, the staffing in order to improve our fluidity there. So that's a big driver. We've invested money in locomotives, so we have more locomotives available as well. And frankly, Paul, why don't you talk a little bit about the process changes that we're making in the terminals, which really are sticky and fundamental drivers for running a scheduled railroad? Paul Duncan : Well, you're spot on. We are seeing results from refreshing our operating leadership, resourcing up, and executing the plan in both volume train speed, and terminal dwell and as Alan highlighted, matched to our premise of running as a scheduled railroad, it's a focus on running the plan; right car, right train, right day, enforcing a high degree of compliance to the plan. Again, that is a fundamental tenant of running a scheduled railroad. It's driving that accountability. We expect to see further consistency as the year progresses. Certainly expect to see dwell continue to improve, train speed continue to improve and as we have seen these metrics quarter our velocity improve, we're going to layer on productivity initiatives as we talked, and that's going to be the focus of us in 2024. Running reliable service and layering on productivity. Alan Shaw : Jordan, you asked about where headcount's going. Let me just put a fine point on that. I do think that our conductor training pipeline really starts to taper down here in the fourth quarter, and I'd expect that we'd probably end the year just under 600. We have enough qualified T&E here probably in the fourth quarter to start capturing meaningful growth that might be on the horizon. And it's really about balancing where those T&E are amongst our hiring locations and we want to make sure that we're not just adequately staffed, but we're at resilient levels in those critical locations. But probably, I would say the other area of headcount, we're going to need some more supervisors now as you add a lot more T&E. So that's probably the remaining pickup you'll see in some of the resilience investments that we're making in the fourth quarter is really around the area of field supervision. But in terms of overall T&E, I think we're cresting here. And now we'll be able to handle more volume and start driving productivity to also take another step up in volume absorption. So that's kind of the roadmap on T&E. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Jason Seidl : Thank you, operator. Alan and team, good morning. Wanted to follow up a little bit on the automotive side. You guys mentioned that there's a backlog of finished vehicles that you could move. Can you give us a sense of how many weeks you think that backlog is for you guys just in case the UAW strike drags on longer than most people would want? And then you made a comment about near shoring and how that is looking really good for you potentially down the road. Do you have any numbers from your industrial development projects? If you can compare in the prior years, that'd be great. Thank you. Ed Elkins : Sure. And thanks for the question. This is Ed. On the automotive side, yes, there have been high shipable ground counts at a lot of places that we originate from. The strike duration is probably longer than I want it to be right now, to be honest with you. And those shipable ground counts are going to dwindle over time and we'll see where it goes. I really can't be more granular than that because of the nature of the strike, which has moved from place to place. On the industrial development side, there's over 600 projects in the pipeline right now. We've seen tremendous investment, mostly in the southeast and the Midwest, which is very beneficial for our network and for our customers. I highlighted a few of those during the prepared remarks and just to be more anecdotal about it, in September we had three new lumber shippers that either originated or started receiving traffic just that month and that's really highlighting, number one, the strength of that, what I would call non-res or manufacturing construction economy, which is, I think, higher now than it was during the entire 2000s for the U.S. Most of that is focused east of the Mississippi River, and most of that is focused again in the Midwest and the Southeast. So we think we're really well teed up, really well positioned for what I think Alan has referred to as a manufacturing super cycle in the coming decade. Jason Seidl : Well, I certainly hope so. You mentioned 600 projects. How does that compare to, say, pre-pandemic? Ed Elkins : Still elevated from a pre-pandemic level. The EV supply chain is really a new frontier that's out there and I think in one of our previous calls I mentioned that there's been over $70 billion invested into that, and about 30% of that is on our lines. Whether it's the Infrastructure Act, the Inflation Reduction Act, the CHIPS Act, there are a lot of compelling reasons, along with geopolitical instability and affordable and reliable energy, to make the U.S. a very compelling place to be. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Ravi Shanker : Thanks, everybody. Just to follow up, the comments on the customer preference for short-haul moves and the empty moves is pretty interesting. Do you have a sense that this is cyclical, or could this be structural given evolutions of supply chains and when the up cycle comes, are you confident that shippers will not choose to prefer faster, shorter-haul truck moves over rail moves? Alan Shaw : Thanks for the question. On the international side, we saw those lanes suffer the most during the pandemic, where steamship lines were basically moving port to port and then allowing customers to pick it up there. That naturally is the part that has reverted back the most and I would say it's naturally reverted back the most strongly because of the capability that we have in some of those markets, like from Savannah into the Southeast, like from Charleston into the Southeast, like from Norfolk into the Midwest, and even from the Port of New York into the hinterland markets. We have a really good portfolio of intermodal services and I'll remind you that over 100 million Americans wake up every morning within 50 miles of one of our intermodal terminals. That is a compelling strength that we think is going to allow us to succeed both on the international end and the domestic side. Ed Elkins : Yeah, look, this is a positive for us, right? This shows that we can add value into the market and even short-haul lanes where rail traditionally has not been competitive and we can do that because of our focus on productivity. We can do that because of our focus on the value of our service product. In the East, that's why we're very confident, right, that we've got a franchise that faces the fastest-growing segments of the U.S. economy. Operator : Next question is from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question. Bascome Majors : Mark, thanks for all the detail you gave us on the Eastern Ohio spending in the plan forward. Can you talk about, without necessarily quantifying, but the timeline of any major charges or outflows that you have a little bit of visibility into that are still ahead of you and is there a point where your ongoing spending tapers off, but the insurance and legal recoveries are still coming in, and your response to this incident shifts from a cash flow burden to a cash flow tailwind? Thank you. Alan Shaw : Okay, Bascome. Thank you very much for that, for the question. We're certainly pleased that we're winding down the site remediation work, which obviously has been costly, as you've seen from my chart and the impact there, but I do think we've got issues that we're going to be working through for several quarters to come and it's really impossible right now, Bascome, to predict the amounts or the timing and, there could be a lot more developments that lead to additional costs, and in particular with regard to litigation matters, fines, penalties, legal fees and these could end up being material, but at the same time, we do have insurance recoveries that have started. We actually got our first cash recovery, that $25 million I cited, that we recorded in the quarter. We actually got the cash last week for that, so that's good. But I don't think that you should expect to see significant, meaningful cash recoveries from insurance in the near term. I think these things are really going to become protracted, but so it's hard to even match the timeline of those inflows with what potential future outflows might be. I think with regard to insurance in general, I think, just bear in mind, it would be reasonable to expect significant premium increases going forward as a result of an incident of this size. So hopefully that's helpful, Bascome. Thank you. Operator : The next question is in the line of Ben Nolan with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Ben Nolan : Yeah, hi. I appreciate it. I wanted to go back to some of the development that you're seeing from some of your customers, and specifically, it's sort of a little bit of a mixed signal. It sounds like there's a lot of people moving forward, but then the lights are not all green. I guess I was curious, have you seen any, as a function of higher interest rates or ambiguity in the market or whatever, any of those projects that make up that $600 on your book here, have any of those shifted to the right, or is there any reason to think that maybe those aren't all full steam ahead? Alan Shaw : Yeah, and well, let me start by reminding everybody, those lives are just for the fourth quarter, so to speak, near-term outlook. Here's what we've seen. We've seen an acceleration in projects associated with manufacturing, probably seen some tail-off or deceleration in projects associated with warehousing and I think that's a direct function of some of the pressure that's coming from interest rates out there. But, you think about whether it's aggregates, whether it's lumber, whether it's structural steel, there is a lot of pent-up demand out there to move product into these building sites. You think about any energy-intensive industry around the world, if you want to be in a place that is not only ecologically responsible, but has reliable, stable, predictable, affordable energy, and great infrastructure to connect you to the rest of the world, the U.S. is compelling. The eastern U.S. is very compelling with its customer base, and the southeast is exceptionally compelling for those. Operator : Our final question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. David Vernon : Hey, good morning, guys, and thanks for the call today. So, Mark, I wanted to go back to one of your earlier comments about sort of expecting average incrementals when volumes do turn. I'm just trying to figure out how I can get comfortable with that, thinking about costs being structurally higher and some of the mixed headwinds that Ed's pointing to in terms of both the short-haul intermodal, bringing back more international entities into the network, and seasoning some of these new intermodal services. Is that average incrementals, is that sort of the day one when volume turns, or should we be thinking about that more as the middle part of the cycle when we think about incremental margins? Thank you. Alan Shaw : Yeah, look, I think we've had a challenging mixed environment here the past couple quarters that have been consuming a lot of the positive pricing, core pricing that Ed and his team have been capturing. At some point, that mixed headwind will reverse, it usually does. But as we think sequentially going into Q4, we're going to have some of the structural headwinds for sure, but that should be offset by the temporary costs related to the service. So I think we're kind of neutral there. And then we're not going to have the same type of fuel headwinds that we had in the third quarter. In fact, I don't think, I think it could be probably flat neutral, maybe slightly, slightly positive. So really, we're talking about volume dropping through. We have seen a nice uptick sequentially in volume, and that should drop through with those normal incrementals of call it 60% or plus. So that's the way I think about Q4 and then longer term, things should play out that way. In any given quarter, obviously, mix is playing a role and hopefully, it's not adverse going into 2024, the way it's been here these past couple few quarters. Operator : This concludes the question and answer session. I'll now turn the call back over to Mr. Alan Shaw for closing comments. Alan Shaw : We certainly appreciate your participation and your questions this morning. Thanks for joining. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",

Turning to Slide 3, it's now my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's President and Chief Executive Officer, Alan Shaw. Alan Shaw : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Norfolk Southern's fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. Here with me today are Mark George, our Chief Financial Officer; Paul Duncan, our Chief Operating Officer; and Ed Elkins, our Chief Marketing Officer. Last year was historically challenging, with a major derailment to start off the year, followed by network disruptions and compounded by a stubbornly weak freight market. The Eastern Ohio incident tested our resolve. I'm proud that our team responded decisively and responsibly to protect this great franchise and our shareholders, and to address the community's concerns. With an unwavering commitment, we have strengthened our safety and service. We have kept and will continue to keep our promises to make things right in Ohio, to improve our service to our customers, and to make a safe railroad even safer. A crisis allows you to accelerate change, and we acted. This includes a number of positive changes to how we design the network and assemble trains with measurable results. As we show on Slide 4, our improvement in safety is already being highlighted by a dramatic 42% reduction in our mainline accident rate in 2023. 2023 was also historically important for Norfolk Southern because we began to implement and advance our new strategy to position our business for sustainable growth and success. The Intermodal Service Composite chart on the right side of Slide 4 tells an important story that speaks to the clear gains we have made in both resiliency and service, following significant strides in service in 2022. With our investments in resiliency through leadership plan and resources, we demonstrated the ability to execute our strategy to run a safer railroad that delivers a compelling service product to our customers and handles increased business, a balanced approach to safely delivering service, productivity and growth. We overcame multiple significant network disruptions in 2023, and exited the year with the best intermodal service we have delivered in over three years, all while intermodal volume grew 5%. Entering 2024 with a safer and more fluid network that is attracting growth, we have the platform to narrow our focus to specific areas to drive increased productivity, and we are building positive momentum by executing on our strategic vision. Part of that strategic vision is our commitment to industry-competitive margins, and we are determined to deliver on that promise just as we have delivered our promises on service and safety as volumes grew. We will leverage our PSR operating plan with our current resource base to meaningfully improve velocity and resilience within our merchandise network, which accounts for two-thirds of our train starts. As we achieve a high degree of compliance to the plan and merchandise, we will reduce variability, complexity and costs. We are driving that forward now with the results already seen in December and January. It will drive asset velocity that will lead to productivity gains and cost savings. And in 2024, we are targeting a double-digit percentage improvement in terminal dwell, which is a good barometer of the health of our and fluidity of our merchandise network. Paul will go into more detail about how we are planning to build on our success in intermodal, deploying changes to accelerate our merchandise network, which I have noted will be a major source of productivity for Norfolk Southern in 2024 and beyond. To further describe what we are doing to improve profitability and drive smart growth in 2024, Ed will talk about how his team is winning business and pushing hard to negotiate price in excess of inflation. Importantly, we are streamlining our cost structure and eliminating inefficiencies. We invested in 2023 to enhance safety and service. We will see the benefits of this in our cost structure in 2024. We'll take actions this year to reduce costs in other areas. This includes a program to reduce management headcount by roughly 7% to help offset increases in critical operating areas. Our groundbreaking transformation will take time. We recognize the necessary investments in resiliency and service have temporarily increased our cost structure, particularly visible during the trough in this freight cycle. On Slide 5, you'll see we laid out the scenario where during a down cycle, we may modestly underperform in order to be coiled to secure volume and incremental margin when the freight cycle recovers. While we didn't expect 2023 to be a continuation of a soft freight market, coupled with numerous disruptions, we are optimistic that recovery is on the horizon and our investments will yield returns. We will deliver near-term margin improvement as we implement our strategic vision, a balance between safe service, productivity and smart growth. We are on the path to achieve that balance. In the aftermath of the derailment and network disruptions, we have improved safety and service in a responsible manner and are in securing new business. With a stabilized network and a high degree of compliance to the plan, we will continue to iterate the plan, reducing complexity and enhancing executability and balance. All of this will unlock productivity and fluidity, which, in-line with our strategy, will allow us to attract more volume at accretive incremental margins and deliver top-tier revenue and earnings growth at industry-competitive margins. With strong franchise advantages that will serve us well as we move through this economic cycle, we are poised for a bright future as we balance safe service, productivity and growth. I'll turn it over to Mark and the rest of the team, who will add some context around the timing and magnitude of our planned improvements in performance and profitability. Mark George : Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 7 with an update on our costs related to the Eastern Ohio derailment. During the fourth quarter, we reached a significant milestone with the bulk of the soil remediation being completed. It's an encouraging achievement, however, as you'll note, we incurred $137 million charge in the quarter, which related to an extension the timeline for ongoing testing as well as additional work that will be completed in nearby streams. There was another $89 million incurred in legal costs and other fees. But of note, we received $76 million of insurance recoveries, bringing the total recoveries in 2023 to just over $100 million. From a cash perspective, the net outflow in 2023 was $652 million after the insurance recoveries. While we're pleased with our remediation accomplishments, we currently expect ongoing monitoring efforts and cleanup efforts will continue through 2024. There will be additional costs in the future related to legal settlements and fees, although the amounts and timing cannot currently be estimated. Moving to Slide 8, where we illustrate the impact of these fourth quarter results on our results. Our GAAP results are in the first row, while on row two we isolate the accounting to our Q4 financials related to the incident. At the bottom of the chart, you'll note the comparisons of the adjusted results to prior year. I'll be talking about our adjusted results for the remainder of the discussion. Revenues were down nearly 5%, while adjusted operating expense was 3% higher. The adjusted operating ratio for Q4 2023 was 68.8%, which represented a year-over-year deterioration, but notably was a 30 basis point sequential improvement from our third quarter performance. The sequential improvement is encouraging, but we fell short of our expectations as service-related costs did not come down as we anticipated. While our recovery efforts related to the IT outages in late Q3 restored service quickly for our customers and allowed us to handle more business, it costs more money in the form of crew-related expenses that persisted well into the fourth quarter. On an adjusted basis, operating income was down 19% year-over-year. Net income and EPS were down 19% and 17%, respectively. Turning now to Slide 9, adjusted operating expense for the quarter was up $59 million. The increase excluding fuel decline was up $123 million. The largest drivers of the increase were employment growth as well as inflation across all categories. In comp and ben, looking to '24, we plan to keep overall headcount levels flat versus the year end 2023 exit rate with some additional mechanical craft hiring to be offset by upcoming reductions in the non-agreement category that Alan discussed. Purchased services was up due to higher costs associated with technology spend, as well as increased mechanical services, including repairs around our auto fleet as we prepare for growth opportunities in 2024. The increase in rents was driven by short-term locomotive resources and increased car supply for our auto fleet. We expect quarterly rents in 2024 to remain slightly above these fourth quarter levels due to more adverse TTX equity costs and volumetric-related increases, partially offset by benefits coming from improved velocity. The increase in materials relates to locomotive and freight car repairs. Claims were lower year-over-year. Recall that in Q4 2022, we had a large adverse adjustment. The other component is unfavorable, driven mainly by fewer real estate gains. Moving now to Slide 10. Last quarter, we introduced this slide to help investors think about our service costs and resiliency investments, which are two components of our current cost structure. On the left side, we see costs that should not be part of our cost structure and have grown out of service that has not met planned levels, mainly related to recrews and overtime. These costs did not step down as expected in Q4 due to the crew-related costs we incurred to accelerate service recovery for our customers after the IT outages. So, while service has been at strong levels exiting the year, Q1 costs will remain somewhat elevated in part from the cold weather we are seeing here in January. Overall service costs should meaningfully unwind in Q2. On the right hand, we show costs tied to our investments in resiliency, mainly related to additional T&E crews that we have added in locations where we were understaffed, as we position Norfolk Southern to realize outsized growth in revenue and margin in a growing volume environment. Our total T&E headcount is now on an appropriate level that will allow us to absorb volume growth in '24 and beyond. There will be some additional hiring in mechanical crafts that will be offset by reductions in non-agreement positions. The additional craft hires mean that resiliency costs will settle in roughly in the $55 million per quarter range in 2024. Adding those resources will drive benefits over time of being an even safer and higher velocity operation. Moving to Slide 11 and results below operating income, other income of $38 million was up $4 million in the quarter, driven by higher interest income on the extra cash we are carrying ahead of the CSR closing. The adjusted effective tax rate was 19.2% due to a rate adjustment on our deferred state income taxes and tax-free gains on favorable company-owned life insurance. For 2024, we expect our tax rate to be in the usual 23% to 24% range. Turning to Slide 12 and recapping our full-year results. We started the year planning for modest top-line growth that would afford a level of expense growth to help drive our strategic track toward resiliency. The disruptive events of the year and an adverse macro environment upended this. Revenue declined 5%, which was meaningfully affected by about 6 points of pressure from lower fuel surcharge revenue and a sharp year-over-year decline in storage fees. At the same time, OpEx rose 5%, fueled by inflation and investments in our business. As a result, operating income fell 18%, with the operating ratio rising to 67.4%. Favorable below-the-line items and benefits from share repurchases held the EPS decline to 15%. In 2023, free cash flow was $1.4 billion lower than the prior year, representing the impact of the $650 million derailment-related outlays, as well as the lower operating income, coupled with higher CapEx. Shareholder distributions in '23 were $1.8 billion, with two-thirds being driven by our rock solid dividend and the remainder from share repurchase activity. I'll mention that we did issue debt in November and built up our cash balance to $1.6 billion at year-end, as we prepare to fund the strategic CSR purchase that is scheduled to close on March 15. As a result, we will see higher interest expense in 2024 and we will temporarily suspend share repurchases while we absorb the asset and bring our credit metrics back into our target range. It's important to remember that CSR is a highly strategic critical artery in our network, for which we had a rare window to secure and guarantee control of the asset forever. This also enables us to control longer-term costs that could have begun to escalate sharply with the upcoming lease renewal. I'll now hand over to Paul, who can provide an update on our operations. Paul Duncan : Thank you, Mark, and good morning. Turning to Slide 15 to begin our operations discussion with safety. We made progress in enhancing safety in 2023. We finished the year with our second best injury rate in eight years, but we are striving for better. We enhanced our conductor training program and continue to leverage our partnership with Atkins Nuclear, a foremost expert in safety across all industries. We also closed 2023 with a 42% reduction in our mainline accident rate and the fewest mainline accidents since 1999. Thank you to all of our craft colleagues and leaders for enhancing safety at Norfolk Southern this last year. While these are very noteworthy accomplishments, we must become even safer. When the major incident in Eastern Ohio happened in early 2023, we were already in the process of reviewing and adjusting our train makeup rules and it was a high priority of mine. We ended up accelerating that work by a lot. What we produced was an even better product than we already had, which helped us make such progress in mainline accidents and we are striving to become even safer. This is the platform for which we can now lever up our train plan to deliver productivity and growth. Though the change in our operating rules was implemented on an accelerated timeline and caused network disruption, we know it was the right move for the long term and we kept our promises to restore fluidity and service levels in the second half of 2023. The future of our operation is very bright and I am proud of the work we did in 2023 on this front to keep our promises. Moving to Slide 16 for further discussion on service levels. We took a modest step backwards to begin the quarter related to the system outages that we experienced, but quickly regained footing and continued our glide path of improvement in November and December. It is important to note that we deliberately chose to deploy additional resources so that we could balance restoring fluidity, while delivering peak volume. We were successful on that front. We delivered a very strong service for our intermodal customers during peak season and pushed overall volumes to their highest levels in over two-and-a-half years as you will hear more about from Ed. But as you heard from Mark, it did result in higher-than-planned service recovery costs in the quarter. We remain sharply focused on reducing those and have actively been unwinding more T&E crew expense in recent weeks in areas such as temporary deployments, overtime, recrews and other crew-related expenses. This has included reducing our intensity of Go Team members deployed on the network. Now that we have made this next step function improvement in intermodal service, we expect to remain there as we transition to leveraging our resources to drive greater productivity and growth. Turning to Slide 17 for a discussion on productivity. We've improved 4% sequentially within workforce productivity and expect an improving glide path to continue. We are driving this in four ways : one, by improving fluidity; two, by maintaining strict discipline and accountabilities to plan compliance in our operation; three, through discrete productivity initiatives that we'll discuss in a moment; and finally, through converting trainees to productive employees. As promised last quarter, we ended the year with 600 conductor trainees. We are now confident with the overall size of our T&E workforce to efficiently serve the growth that is on the horizon. On the locomotive front, referencing our service commentary, miles per day remained lower as we kept additional power and service to jumpstart the network with peak volume. This is an area that will benefit significantly from further improvements in velocity as faster train speeds allow us to drive our locomotives in the terminals on time and send them back out on their scheduled connections. And lastly, fuel efficiency finished flat despite the additional locomotives online, thanks to our initiatives, and this is an area we are intensely focused on improving in 2024. Moving to Slide 18, the next phase of our operational improvement will be marked by enhancing the velocity and resilience within our merchandise network. Recall that our TOP|SPG operating plan, which we launched in 2022, brought further PSR principles to our intermodal network, driving enhancements to container velocity and resilience within intermodal. That successful evolution enabled intermodal service to remain strong throughout 2023, particularly in Q4, where we delivered the best intermodal service in over three years, while delivering on peak season. Now we are building on that success with further enhancements in our merchandise network. First, we are improving our execution and discipline to run with a higher level of planned compliance. We're tying together the improvements we've made around our operational strategy, leadership accountabilities and resource allocation by sweating our assets further and strict execution to the plan. Next, we are leveraging precision train building processes embedded into our terminals to optimize connections and depart trains on time. We're already seeing the benefits that arise from success in driving scheduled network velocity. Our success will be demonstrated by making sustained improvement in terminal dwell, whereas Alan mentioned in his opening remarks, we expect to drive a low-double-digit percentage improvement in 2024 versus 2023. Investors can also track our progress in the AAR train speed, particularly the subset of manifest train speed, which has an outsized impact on our cost structure as well as merchandise trip plan compliance and car velocity, the outcomes of improving speed, dwell and disciplined execution of plan. Of course, there is always week-to-week noise in these measures, so we would look for improvements in trends on a rolling 12-week basis. On Slide 19, I'd like to provide more detail on how sustaining these velocity improvements will drive down our cost structure. First, we will see reductions in various buckets of T&E-related expense, and that will also help to lower our headcount intensity. Next, as we spin up the flywheel, we'll get cars moving faster, a critical element to scheduled railroading and overall productivity. Having our yards and mainlines more fluid will indicate that cars are flowing unimpeded through the network. This will drive a capacity and productivity dividend within our fleets in our yards and on our mainlines. That in turn will allow us to bring on growth at low incremental cost, lifting overall workforce and locomotive productivity and achieving service resilience that will allow us to take further share from truck. Driving these benefits in our operation by improving the velocity and resilience of the merchandise network will be a key aspect of delivering progress in 2024. Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Ed. Ed Elkins : Thanks, Paul, and good morning to everybody on the call. Beginning on Slide 21, let's cover our commercial results for the fourth quarter. Overall volume improved 3%, led by growth in intermodal and our automotive markets. Now, despite volume growth, total revenue and revenue per unit declined for the quarter due to lower revenue from fuel surcharge and intermodal storage and fees, along with negative shipment mix within the portfolio continuing from last quarter, as well as headwinds from a weak truck price environment due to the persistent overabundance of capacity. Looking at merchandise, volume was flat compared to the prior period and revenue was challenged by lower revenue from fuel surcharge compared to that prior period. RPU less fuel increased 1% as price gains more than offset the impacts from negative mix. This increase set a new quarterly record for Norfolk Southern and marks the 34 of the last 35 consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth in merchandise RPU less fuel. We're committed to driving value through price, and this commitment is demonstrated through quarterly records set in our automotive market for revenue, revenue less fuel, revenue per unit and revenue per unit less fuel. Let's move to intermodal. Volume in the quarter increased 5% year-over-year with gains in both our domestic and international lines of business. Revenue for intermodal was down 13% year-over-year, primarily driven by significantly lower revenue from storage and fees in the prior period. Also lower fuel prices and an excess supply of available trucks as well as negative mix within our international business impacted revenue per unit negatively. Excluding the impacts of fuel and elevated storage and fees, which are related to supply chain congestion, intermodal RPU declined 1% in the quarter. We're confident our domestic franchise is a coiled spring, positioned to yield strong incremental value as the truck market recovers. Turning to coal. Overall volume increased slightly with strong demand for export more than offsetting declines in our utility coal franchise. The market for utility confronted persistently high stockpiles and low natural gas prices. Coal revenue was down 4% year-over-year with lower commodity prices and lower revenue from fuel surcharge negatively impacting RPU. Now, let's turn to Slide 22 and review results for the full year. Total volume came in at 6.7 million units, a 1% decrease from 2022. Volume declines were most significant in intermodal and our energy-related chemical commodities. On the positive side, lower ocean freight rates, advanced demand for international intermodal and rising vehicle production activity drove growth in our automotive franchise, both of which contributed meaningfully to offsetting larger declines. Revenue for the year was $12.2 billion, down 5%, or $590 million from 2022, driven by lower revenue from fuel surcharge and storage fees, as well as lower volume. I do think it's important to point out, however, that if we exclude the $650 million revenue hit from fuel and storage fees, which is essentially a post-pandemic normalization of those items, underlying revenue was actually positive, even with volume down 1%, which speaks to our commitment to core pricing smart growth. RPU, excluding fuel, intermodal storage and fees, increased 2% as we realized above budget price results in merchandise and in coal. In fact, we set annual records for merchandise revenue, revenue less fuel and RPU less fuel. Objectively, the freight environment in 2023 was soft, with weak demand for goods, lower levels of manufacturing activity, and generally less freight coming in from overseas. These conditions amplified the excess capacity in transportation, pressuring margins and growth opportunities. Our focus throughout the year was creating value with a resilient network to drive growth. In the fourth quarter, we saw that growth materialize with improved volume, and that volume will bolster our revenue performance in the coming year as we execute our pricing strategy to grow core revenue per unit. Let's look ahead to 2024 on Slide 23. Our market outlook is for modest volume growth. In merchandise markets, overall volume growth is expected to be driven by gains in steel shipments. Automotive will grow on continued strength in vehicle production, including new EV business. Improved fluidity and increased network velocity will lift our effective capacity in both of these markets. Shifting to intermodal, we are optimistic that increasing levels of international trade will boost demand for both our domestic and international services. There's still uncertainty around how quickly capacity in the truck market right-sizes. Additionally, the strength of the consumer could pressure growth if the economy softens. Lastly, our coal outlook is for relatively flat volume levels compared to last year. Demand for export coal is forecasted to be high, but some of this demand will be met via a shift of historically domestic coal to export markets. Utility demand will be driven by stockpile levels, which are forecast to remain elevated in 2024, aside from extreme weather events. Looking at price, we expect strong pricing conditions in our merchandise markets, aided by our improved service product. However, as mentioned, a persistently weak truck market will mute the opportunity for intermodal price, with contract truck rates expected to trend roughly sideways from their current levels throughout 2024. We also faced some headwinds on coal pricing this year related to difficult comparisons for seaborne coal prices, with additional pressure from high stockpiles and weak natural gas prices. All said, we still expect to generate pricing above rail inflation in 2024. When we take all this together, we are reasonably confident that overall market fundamentals will create opportunities for us to bring on new freight and further the volume trend we achieved in the fourth quarter of 2023, while delivering incremental top-line revenue growth through core pricing gains, as we price into the value of our enhanced service product. Finally, let's turn to Slide 24. I'd like to give you some examples of how our customer-centric approach is yielding smart and sustainable growth. Last February, our team met with FedEx Ground with the intent to enhance Norfolk Southern service for their transportation network. We listened to their business forecast and made strategic adjustments that we knew would set us up to better serve this valued customer. We charted a better way forward for both of our organizations. As a result, we were able to significantly increase our volume for FedEx Ground during peak season, and we look forward to continuing that growth into the future. We also landed a new plastic recycling plant in Ohio with our new customer Pure Cycle, which is expected to launch this quarter. This is a great example of the circular loop that is possible within the plastic supply chain and how Norfolk Southern can deliver that resin in a carbon-friendly manner. Finally, 2023 was another successful year for the Norfolk Southern Industrial Development team. We partnered with 62 customers to facilitate the completion of strategic industrial development projects in 2023. Collectively, these projects represent $3.1 billion in customer investment and the creation of more than 4,150 new jobs along Norfolk Southern lines. As we look into 2024, we're encouraged by the continued robust pipeline of customers that are looking to locate facilities along our lines. These successes in 2023 are indicative of the success that we expect in '24 and demonstrates our strategy to deliver a better way forward for our customers, our communities and for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it back over to Alan. Alan Shaw : We overcame a number of challenges in 2023 and we are moving forward with confidence. Our resolve to deliver on all aspects of our strategy has never been stronger. We restored service and improved safety in a responsible manner to protect our franchise and long-term shareholder value. We ended 2023 with the best intermodal service we've seen in years and with an encouraging 5% increase in intermodal volume. Now, we enter 2024 with a fluid network, which will drive productivity gains and further growth this year. Turning to our outlook. We anticipate roughly 3 points of revenue growth in 2024. This growth, combined with our productivity initiatives, will yield strong accretive incremental margins, with operating income growing in excess of revenues. Net income and EPS growth will be suppressed in 2024 versus 2023, owing to higher interest expense from the highly strategic acquisition of CSR, along with the temporary suspension of our share repurchase program. As for the progression through the year, typical seasonality suggests that second quarter and third quarter should be our strongest in terms of margin performance. Obviously, the first quarter will have some industry-wide impact from widespread cold weather in January, and our first quarter still has year-over-year headwinds from storage fees, fuel revenue and export coal price. In-line with the Investor Day guidance, over the midterm horizon, we anticipate delivering strong incremental margins, presuming a normal freight cycle and mix, and 3 points to 4 points of revenue growth. A combination of volume absorption, productivity initiatives and a commitment to cost control will be key drivers. We aren't going to give you a specific margin target, but it should result in between 100 basis points to 150 basis points of margin improvement annually, on the pathway to narrow the margin gap with peers and deliver industry-competitive margins. You'll start to see progress along those lines in 2024, once we lap some of the revenue compared challenges in the first half. We see a path to outsize gains on the upcycle, leveraging volume growth within existing resources, ample productivity runway, and strong core pricing that can outpace inflation pressures. As we narrow our margin gap over time, the secular growth prospects of our powerful franchise will deliver shareholder value through earnings momentum and free cash flow generation. And with that, let's open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Chris Wetherbee : Yeah, hi. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to think a little bit about the bigger picture here, Alan. You talked about the 100 basis points to 150 basis points of OR opportunity per year over a three-year period. As we kind of think about you guys relative to some of your closer peers, that's about half of the gap that exists today. So, I guess as you think over, is there more opportunity beyond that? It just takes time to get there? Do you think that there is the potential for a structural gap between you and your closest geographic peer? I just want to get a sense of how you think about the opportunity maybe beyond that three years and how it might play out. Alan Shaw : Chris, we've committed to industry-competitive margins. And in '23, we overcame a lot. We made a lot of progress on our strategic plan. We enhanced safety, we improved service, we attracted new business, we overcame challenges. As we look into '24, it's really a focus on productivity, and we feel like we're going to be on that pathway of 100 basis points to 150 basis points a year, particularly as we get into the second half of the year and lap some of these revenue comps. But we gave a three-year outlook, but that's not an endpoint. We have talked about continuous productivity improvement as one of the three components of our balanced strategy of safe service, continuous productivity improvement, and smart growth. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Ken Hoexter : Hey, great. Good morning. I guess I'm still surprised by that timeframe, right. Should seem like there's still moves that would get you that leverage a bit quicker, I guess, just compared to some moves we've seen some other rails. So, maybe just was the impetus for some of these changes the headcount, the three-year OR targets? There's been some activist chatter in the market. Is that something that's edging you behind in terms of making some of these changes? And then, I guess ultimately the question is, is pricing accretive to margins in '24? Thanks. Alan Shaw : Hey, Ken, with us entering the third year of a freight recession and with the investments that we've made in safety and service that are delivering meaningful results, it's clear that our cost structure is too high for our revenue base entering 2024. And so, we addressed service, we addressed safety, we addressed growth in '23. We did it in a responsible manner to protect our franchise and our shareholders. Now, as we enter 2024, we've got a much more fluid network, much safer network and network that is attracting growth, and it's a focus on productivity. And so, yeah, we're looking at every cost out there. And we're looking at discretionary costs, we're looking at management costs, and we're focused on productivity, because it is a balanced plan. I'll let Ed talk about price. Ed Elkins : Yeah. We were successful in '23 on price. And in '24, we have a good price plan that's strong and really is going to produce value every quarter of this year. So, we feel good about where we are with price. And there's a couple of things that I'll add to that. We're feeling really good about where we are with our service trajectory at this point. We're hearing from customers that they appreciate the value that we're providing for them, and we're doing it at the facility level, going out and talking to customers, focused on that first and final mile and how we add value, and that's going to produce value for us and for our shareholders all year long. Ken Hoexter : Thanks. I appreciate it. And I know one question, but I'm just trying to understand, are you saying then we get better margins in '24? Is that pricing outpacing that cost? Sorry, just trying to understand the answer there. Mark George : That's part of the equation. Yeah, that is part of the equation, for sure. Ken Hoexter : Thanks, Mark. Thanks, guys. Alan Shaw : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott Group : Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. So, Alan, you've been telling us for a little while now that maybe we'll see weaker decrementals at the trough, but then we'll see better incremental on the way back up. I think about Q4, where we started to see the way back up. We saw some pretty good volume growth, and the incremental margins were still really muted even with a nice fuel lag tailwind. So, how do I think about why we didn't see it this quarter? And then, maybe just going-forward, you just said the cost structure is too high. I don't know that I heard that you're telling us that costs come down from here maybe I misheard. Or do cost come down from here? And then, I don't know, just to put it all together, Mark, sometimes you just give us some color on near-term OpEx and margin. How to think about Q1? That would be helpful. Thank you. Alan Shaw : Yeah, Scott, we had to overcome a lot in '23, And we made investments in a prudent manner to enhance safety, enhance service and attract growth, particularly in our most service-sensitive markets. And so, we're putting -- with respect we're putting proof points up on the Board. As we move through into the fourth quarter, we were still wrestling with a service product that was off plan, which adds complexity, adds variability and adds cost. We're operating in a really tough freight environment and we were dealing with pretty healthy year-over-year inflation, and we're still lapping some difficult comps with respect to the fuel surcharge revenue and with respect to storage revenue, right? Mark George : And mix. Alan Shaw : And mix. And so, as we move into '24, those things are going to start to unwind themselves, right? We've got a much more fluid network. We're operating on plan. That will drive out our service recovery costs. And then, after that, we're going to continue to iterate to our plan. That's going to help drive productivity, and we're going to attract new business. And as you noted, our strategy is all about outperforming during an upmarket. I don't see that in the next six months. When the economy does recover, it always does, when the freight market does recover and it always does, we're going to be called for growth. Scott Group : Mark, any color on the OpEx, the OR, Q1, again, just I don't know that I asked -- you said the cost structure is too high. Does it come down or not? I guess I'm not sure what the answer is. Mark George : So, I think as you go into Q1, you're going to have some of the normal seasonality that has an impact on your OR. So, I think you need to expect that the first half, Q1 in particular, is probably going to step back, but then we feel much better as we lap a lot of the headwinds that we've been talking about from this first half, the intermodal storage charges, some of the fuel price and some of the other RPU challenges we're having on coal price, I think as we get to that back half is where you're going to really start to see much stronger incrementals and drop through. Scott Group : Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Amit Mehrotra : Thanks. Hi, everybody. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, Alan, if we look at the three-year plan, I think if you ask every railroad in North America, they tell you that they also would expect to improve margins by 100 basis points to 150 basis points a year from where we are today. So, I guess the negative implication of that outlook is that you're not actually narrowing the gap, you're just improving your position from where you are, but the gap actually stays intact. So, I'd be curious to get your perspective on that. And I think the cost structure is high, which is you're addressing that by taking these difficult actions with non-salaried workers. And I know that's a really difficult decision. But it seems also like when I look at the cost structure, it seems like the answer to something going wrong is throwing as many resources at that problem as possible. If I look at materials expense or rents expense, and if I talk to any kind of operating intensive railroad, their answer is, you never really drown a problem with resources. That's the opposite of what you should do. So, I'm trying to understand the removal of the non-union or the rationalization of the non-union employees is one step in that direction. But are we having a rethink about how we actually operate the railroad day-in and day-out and how we respond to issues? Because it seems like that's kind of the root cause of the problem in terms of where the gap is today. Sorry for the long-winded question, but just want to get your perspective on that. Alan Shaw : What was the first part of your question, Amit? Amit Mehrotra : Well, just in terms of the -- yeah, sure, Alan, the three-year outlook, 100 basis points to 150 basis points, every rail on the continent will think that. So, you're not actually narrowing the gap. So that was the question. Alan Shaw : Well, that's our commitment. Our commitment is industry-competitive margins and top-tier revenue and earnings growth. And we said we were going to do that through an economic cycle. We said we would have difficulty within industry-competitive margins during a trough and the freight market. And candidly, we didn't expect some of the incidents that occurred in 2023, the network disruptions, the Eastern Ohio incident, and a continuation of a very difficult truck market. We invested throughout 2023 for the long term, and in the long-term best interests of Norfolk Southern and our shareholders. And we improved service. We improved safety. Volumes grew in the fourth quarter. Now, we can really narrow our focus, right? We can narrow our focus into productivity, and that's exactly what we're doing. And we're going to drive that by operating to the plan, a high degree of compliance to the plan, that will shed resources, that's going to shed a lot of the service recovery resources that you just referenced. As we get on plan, we'll continue to iterate the plan and look for additional ways to drive out complexity, drive out costs and improve balance. Mark George : And just adding to what Alan said, as we think back to the fourth quarter, it was all about driving intermodal service, recognizing that the service sensitivity of that was going to directly drive growth to this railroad, which we did see. The shift in the layering on now is towards driving that discipline and rigor inside of our merchandise network. We recognize that is where our single biggest opportunity is. Total T&E is as a result of that, essentially troughed in October. And we expect that we're going to see greater productivity as we continue to dial-in our merchandise network. That's going to be a reduced number of recrews and all the associated costs, taxis, hotels, deadheading, overtime, car hire, equipment expense. We're going to see improved capacity in our merchandise network as cars per carload improves. So that's the flywheel impact that we're talking about. So, to your question about what is fundamentally changing moving forward, it's from where we are now moving forward, a direct focus on merchandise, recognizing that's our next single biggest lever for productivity. Alan Shaw : That's where two-thirds of our operating costs are. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Jon Chappell : Thank you. I hate to keep on the guidance a bit, but I'm going to move up to the revenue line here. I'm just trying to understand the roughly 3%. I get that there's macro headwinds. I understand the first half may be difficult. But by the same token, you have incredibly easy volume comps, given all the disruption from February until August. And Ed talked about the continuation of the pricing above inflation. So, one would probably expect the volumes to be a little bit better than 3%, just given the comparisons. So, are we saying that all in yield may be down this year? Or is there just like a healthy element of conservatism that you're putting into the macroeconomy in the first half of the year that may be tamping that number down? Ed Elkins : I think there is -- this is Ed, by the way. There is a lot of uncertainty around what's going to happen here in the first half of the year. I think the Street has baked a lot of expectations around Fed actions and we'll see where that goes. But frankly, you look at first quarter and we see pretty sedate volume opportunities here in the first quarter, and the recent weather events for the entire industry has kind of confirmed that. But then, we see a steady progression of volume improvement throughout the year. And I think volume improvement will probably lead the parade, so to speak, in terms of revenue and yield improvement for us. But we're pretty confident we might be conservative around coal price, but that's, I think, the right thing to do for ourselves as well as for the rest of the industry. Jon Chappell : Okay. Thank you, Ed. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes in line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Tom Wadewitz : Yeah, good morning. I want to ask you one granular one and then kind of a higher level one. So, I guess on the granular question, for Paul, should we think about with a fairly muted volume backdrop that train starts would come down in '24? Or are you thinking kind of, hey, the schedule is set and we'll keep that where it is? And then, the higher-level question, I think when investors look at Norfolk, they say, okay, there is a potential idiosyncratic opportunity to run the system better. Maybe that runs on its own regardless of freight market. But I don't know that that's clear. So, should we look at it as more of a kind of idio improvement story or is this really a freight market, freight cycle leverage story, right, that it is really -- when the freight market improves, if that second half, if that's '25, then you're just really well positioned for that. So, I think just trying to figure out what's really the right way to look at the Norfolk story. Thank you. Alan Shaw : Paul, why don't you address the first question? I'll take the second. Paul Duncan : Yeah, absolutely, Tom, thanks for the question. So, we think about it not just as train starts, but overall T&E productivity, it's all about getting the most from our crews. And we're going to see that improve through not only what we've seen here over the past several weeks for improvements in network velocity, but running more discipline to plan and layering down initiatives. We know running more discipline to plan is already starting to show itself in reductions in T&E expense. You've seen it in the productivity measures from the slides. We're going to make further iterations to the plan as we get more disciplined, particularly in our merchandise network. And that's only going to drive improvements in GTMs per horsepower, but also on the T&E side. We've got a number of initiatives beyond just running the plan more disciplined and seeing that cost come out again that we're layering on. We've got pool transitions taking place. So, as we have gotten more fluid and more consistent, we have transitioned more short pool runs to long pool runs, again because we've got greater consistency and velocity in the network that has productivity benefits. We have put more towards assigned service from a T&E standpoint. That means we've got assigned crew pools and turns that reduces hotels, van expenses, has a quality-of-life benefit. We are going to roll out predictable work scheduling this year on our conductors -- or with our conductor, excuse me. More than 80% of our schedule -- our network is scheduled, meaning as we layer in predictable work scheduling, we will see a benefit in reductions in displacement time. We've got a number of board consolidation initiatives that are taking place, and we're driving accountabilities to run lean and two plan inside of our merchandise yard. So that all translates into we're going to see train length on the merchandise side. We've got line of sight on some improvements we can make there. Not only through further iterations of the plan, we've also got some investments planned this year in some of our major merch channels that are going to drive productivity and train length. Intermodal train length went up in Q4 as a direct result of us not only delivering great service, but customers rewarding us with business. And again, we're going to continue to work on that. And from a bulk standpoint, you've heard us talk about the various longer-term initiatives we have with our customers to invest in facilities, particularly in our [indiscernible] network. Several elevators are investing, and we expect to really see the benefits as those investments come to play. Alan Shaw : And Tom, to your second question, as we've gone through 2023 and we've made the necessary improvements in safety, in service, and attractive growth, we can really start to focus on productivity in our own plan and execution of that plan. That provides benefit as well. And then, our whole strategy is about outperforming during the upcycle. Our franchise is built to outperform during the upcycle. You've seen us recover from network disruptions much faster than we have in the past. So, there's a proof point as well. We're not calling when that upcycle occurs, but when it does, we do believe that we will outperform, and we will attract new business with high incremental margins. So, it's improving our own operations and executability with the plan as we can now narrow our focus on really operating to the plan and driving efficiencies and then participating and outperforming during the upcycle. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Brian Ossenbeck : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just quick follow-up for Paul. If you can just give us some sense in terms of how much of those productivity metrics you're talking about are actually independent of volume? I'm sure that would help. But how much do you have line of sight if volume stays flat or maybe doesn't recover in the back half? And then just to ask more broadly, do you think there's a structural margin gap that will always be here for this network versus some of your peers? You do have roughly 10 percentage points more intermodal. It's more truck competitive. You can have shorter length of haul dynamics with international as well, lighter weight, more touches. So, I'd just be curious to hear if that's something you think about in the long term in terms of closing that gap, that might be a hindrance or if there's something I'm not thinking about from a productivity density perspective, that could make that an incorrect assumption. Thank you. Alan Shaw : Brian, each franchise has unique strengths. We have committed to top-tier revenue and top-tier earnings growth, coupled with industry-competitive margins. We're going to deliver that. We've got a franchise that faces the fastest growing segments of the U.S. economy and a franchise that's poised for growth. We're entering the third year of a freight recession. That will unwind. And when it does, the enhancements that we've made to safety, the enhancements that we've made to service, the ability to attract business in the fourth quarter, and automotive and intermodal, which are our most service-sensitive markets, right, give us a pathway to success going forward and allow us to unlock our full potential. And Paul and his team and entire executive team are intently focused on driving out cost inefficiencies and driving productivity. Mark George : Let me just add real quick. This entire team recognizes that a margin gap exists today between where we are and where we should be, and we're focused intently on closing and narrowing that gap before we get to an area of talking about why any remaining gap exists. There's a lot of runway still for us organically and self help. Paul Duncan : Yeah. The specific around how much is initiatives versus volume adjust, many of those initiatives that I spoke to are going to continue regardless of the volume environment. The iterations to the plan are always going to continue, but that is going to be the lever that is most sensitive to volume. But we're going to continue to drive train life. We're going to continue to drive crew productivity regardless of the volume environment. Brian Ossenbeck : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Brandon Oglenski : Hey, good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking my question. And I guess maybe the frustration from the investor side is that if we go back a couple of analyst meetings, maybe even back to 2015, the mantra here has always been that we're trying to close the gap. But I guess constructively, Paul or Ed, can you help us understand where you are in trip plan compliance with your customers? Because I think ultimately, it's consistency of service that matters, right? So, what can you talk about what did you learn through changing the make-up rules through 2023? And where is the future on service to your customers? What are you seeing today? Paul Duncan : Well, let me start off, and I'd love to have Ed jump in here as well. From an intermodal perspective, as we look at where we finished fourth quarter, we delivered the best intermodal service we have put across this railroad in several years, and customers rewarded us with volume as a result. We expect to maintain that level of service based on what we've heard from our customers is their expectation. From a merchandise standpoint, we continue to see improvements in merchandise trip plan compliance throughout the year. To your point around the train makeup rules, we said that we were going to recover after we had moved forward with those, meant to again drive greater safety and resiliency across our network. We feel very confident that we've seen -- merchandise trip line compliance continue to come up throughout the year, and we feel that we're very confident as we look at 2024 based on the further discipline that we are going to build and drive inside of our merchandise network. Ed Elkins : I'd offer a couple of proof points just to think about that are recent. The first one is we had one of our very largest customers comment to us that come emerging from the weather events that just happened in the past year -- or, excuse me, in the past week, that we recovered better than just about anybody else. And we really take that to heart because they themselves are a broad survey of many other railroads. So, we think that that's really important as a proof point for resilience. As we return back to plan faster and faster after inevitable events, that's going to define a large part of the value that we're offering customers. Brandon Oglenski : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens Inc. Please proceed with your question. Justin Long : Thanks, and good morning. So, for 2024, there are a lot of moving pieces that you've talked about. But when you put it all together, do you think you'll be within that targeted longer-term range of 100 basis points to 150 basis points of annual improvement in the OR? And, Mark, I think you and Alan both mentioned the interest expense headwind you'll have this year. I was wondering if you could help quantify that year-over-year headwind. Mark George : Yeah. Thanks, Justin. Let's be explicit with interest. We ended 2023 with about $17.2 billion of outstanding debt. The effective interest rate is about 4.7%. So, I would model about $210 million a quarter for interest expense on the go forward. We've essentially kind of pre-funded that CSR acquisition, so that should be relatively steady within a couple of few million dollars per quarter of that. And as we look at the moving pieces, again, we've got some headwinds here in the first half. I think as volume starts to grow as we go from Q2 to Q3 and then into Q4, we should really start to see, with the compares, a pretty good improvement year-over-year. So, I don't see so much in the first quarter certainly. I think there's a risk of regression there. But I think as we navigate the second quarter depending on volumes, but in particular in the second half is where you'll see most of the improvement. And, look, I think that 100 basis points and 150 basis points that we're talking about kind of on the go forward, we should definitely be there in the back half. Whether it translates into a full year amount or not, I think depends on a number of other factors. Justin Long : Okay. Thanks. Mark George : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Jason Seidl : Thank you. Good morning, guys. I'll put the bat away for the horse, that is guidance here, and turn the attention a little bit to what you're seeing in terms of impacts from any diversions on the port side, whether they're from geopolitical events or from the Panama Canal. And if you haven't seen them yet, do you expect to see them? And what sort of impact should we look going forward? Alan Shaw : Ed, what do you hear from customers? Ed Elkins : We're talking to our customers a lot about this. It's a situation that has grown over time. We haven't seen any impact yet to our volumes. Fact is, our East Coast port volumes continue to be remarkably strong, and we are hearing customers start to evaluate their West Coast options, and that makes sense, given some rather unprecedented things that are going on. But regardless, the great thing about our network is we're well positioned to pick up that volume growth, whether it comes in the East Coast or the West Coast. And I think we're going to be able to very ably serve our customers and satisfy their needs. Jason Seidl : Ed, is there a preference on East Coast versus West Coast in the network? Ed Elkins : Well, I've got all kinds of preferences, but no, we've got the network built to take on volume, whether it comes through the East Coast or the West Coast. I think there's probably more intermodal conversion opportunity when it comes through the West Coast. But we've gotten very good at doing short haul intermodal with our international customers. Alan Shaw : Frankly, that's one of the benefits of our franchise, right? Ed Elkins : Ture. Alan Shaw : We've got the most powerful intermodal franchise in the East, which serves 60% of the consumers. So, no matter whether it comes in the East Coast or West Coast, we're going to handle it. Ed Elkins : That's right. Jason Seidl : Appreciate the time, as always, gentlemen. Alan Shaw : Thank you. Ed Elkins : Thank you, Jason. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Allison Poliniak : Hi, good morning. So, with the focus on long-term growth, could you maybe talk to the growth investment embedded in CapEx? Is it higher? Is it lower? And then, with that longer-term margin roadmap, is there an offset embedded in that given just sort of the ongoing investment in service that NS is making? Just any thoughts there. Thanks. Alan Shaw : Mark, you want to talk about the capital program, please? Mark George : Yeah. I mean, the capital guidance actually for '23, I think I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that was going to be largely flat with 2022. And I would say that the mix within that between reinvesting in the business and safety and resilience, it's about the same as what it was in 2022, call it about 60%, 65%, and the growth element to that is the balance, call it, 35%, and that's pretty consistent between the two years, Allison. Second part of your question again, I don't recall. Allison Poliniak : Yeah. Just that longer-term margin roadmap, obviously you're investing in service. Is there sort of an offset embedded in that margin just given this ongoing investment? It certainly doesn't end here. Just trying to think through that. Alan Shaw : Well, I know that a faster network is a less expensive network. So, as we invest in service and we invest in resiliency, it translates to fewer recruits, fewer network disruptions, fewer -- less overtime, less equipment rents, improved fuel consumption and fuel efficiency. So yeah, that's the part of our franchise -- or pardon me, of our strategy, right, it's that balance between service, productivity and growth, and they build on each other. Thank you. Mark George : The velocity piece plays into the growth. Alan Shaw : Thank you, Allison. Allison Poliniak : Got it. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Jordan Alliger : Yeah, hi. Just a couple of clarifications here, make sure I understand. In terms of thinking about this year, in light of the -- you mentioned, steadily increasing volume assumptions and then increasing incrementals, particularly in the second half and the year-over-year improvement in margin, notably in the second half. I guess the question is what needs to happen to do better than to -- the 100 basis points to 150 basis points, the longer-term target? I would imagine part of the plan for the back half of this year is probably to exceed that, I would think. And then, secondarily, can you give a little more color around the use of cash this year? I think you said you're suspending the buyback, but the interest expense is pretty high. So, is debt reduction part of it? Because I think you also mentioned you want to get the liquidity ratios more in line. So, maybe where do you hope to end the year on that front? Thanks. Mark George : Yeah, Jordan, on the cash side, yeah, we've got the big CSR purchase here in March. We've gone outside of our preferred debt to EBITDA range at the very end of the year, in part because we've had to also fund these Palestine costs. So that will continue to consume some cash as well in 2024, and then we've got the CSR purchase in addition to that. There are no debt redemptions planned this year. So, it's really an issue of operating cash minus CapEx, gets you to free cash flow. And then, in that free cash flow, we've got our CapEx budget, which is flat with last year, as well as the CSR purchase. From there, we don't expect to have remaining cash to do share repurchase. So, as we go into 2025, we should be in a better track with EBITDA growth to start to have a more normal capital allocation cycle like we've experienced in the past. Jordan Alliger : Thanks. And then just the first part. Mark George : Yeah. Why don't you repeat the first part? Jordan Alliger : Yeah. I mean, sure you've mentioned a few times that you expect steadily increasing volumes and steadily increasing incrementals as we move through the year, with the second half seeing the lion's share, I suppose, of the margin improvements. I guess I'm just curious would the plan contemplate in excess of the 100 basis points to 150 basis points in the back half? And what needs to happen to do that? I assume it's volume, but... Mark George : Yeah. So, Jordan, I think as you look at it, one thing that's going to happen on the cost side is these service costs that I laid out in my chart will come out. They may not come out as great in the first quarter, largely because of what we're doing to mitigate the cold weather, but they're going to come out and they're going to start coming out in the first quarter. And the plan is that most of those will start to release here in the second quarter, if not, it will be completely gone. So that provides us some traction for sure. A lot of the other fluidity and improvements that Paul mentioned will start to really take hold and provide traction, where we actually think our T&E counts may end the year a little bit lower than where they started the year, which means you're taking on more volume and you're actually having perhaps fewer crews, that's embedded productivity right there. And then, of course, we're doing actions on the non-agreement side that will also yield some benefits. So, we feel really good about our back half and our margin profile. I think a little bit stronger revenue, we can absolutely outperform that 150 basis points in the back half -- the 100 basis points to 150 basis points in the back half, and possibly be there for the full year because of it. Jordan Alliger : Thank you. Mark George : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Ravi Shanker : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Maybe just a high-level question here, maybe going back to some of the previous questions asked and just tying it up. I mean, look, there's obviously a margin gap to your peers and it's kind of easy to point the cost to the reason why. But you guys have been cutting costs for many years and you've taken a lot of resources down and you've done a lot to improve the service product. I think you have the lowest cost per carload of any of your peers. At what point is this not really a cost problem and is more of a revenue problem and that needs the bulk of the resources addressing that rather than trying to take out more cost? Alan Shaw : Look, it's a balanced approach, and we overcame a lot of Norfolk Southern specific headwinds in 2023. And we enter 2024 with a safer network, a more fluid network and a network that is attracting business from our most service-sensitive customers. Once we get through this freight recession, and we will, we are poised for outperformance during the upcycle. That is the essence of our strategy. We're doing what we laid out at our Investor Day 14 months ago. And I'm proud of the way that we've overcome these obstacles in 2023 and set the stage for margin improvement in 2024, while protecting the best long-term interest of our shareholders and the Norfolk Southern franchise. Mark George : Yeah. Make no mistake, Ravi, this franchise, this network is built to handle a lot more volume, but we have a lot of cost runway ahead of us. And that's what we're focused on right now and we're certainly going to welcome the revenue when it comes. And I think again that's going to drive the high incrementals at that point. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. David Vernon : Hi, thanks guys, and thanks for taking the question. So, Mark, on the topic of cost, I think there were some headlines last night about some headcount actions, non-union workforce. Is there a specific cost program in place with a quantifiable number that we can be thinking about in terms of pursuit of sort of the non-operational costs as we kind of await the flywheel starting to spin? Mark George : Well, with regard to the non-agreement program, maybe I'm going to assume that's what you're referring to, we had mentioned about 7% was our target and that's kind of deal over 300 people. But I think that the timing will probably start to take effect here in the second quarter, just the way the voluntary program works. So, we'll start to see the cost relief take place here in the second quarter. And frankly, the savings amount will depend upon the mix of the folks that put their names in. So, we certainly internally have a number in mind and we'll see where it settles after that. But we're going to -- aside from that, there are other areas we're going to go after. Again, we're not happy with our purchased service spend. We were in a year of very difficult, challenging situation where we had to quickly get our network up and running again from a number of challenges, be it weather or accidents. So, we've put a lot of money into quickly revamp using some outside services to quickly revamp our network on the mechanical side as well as engineering side. I would hope that those things start to really settle down. That's our focus, Paul and I, as well as even on the technology spend, we've been using a lot more software as a service, cloud-based services, which show up in purchased services as opposed to CapEx. So that's been putting pressure on our purchased services, but we've got to try to again put a lid on that growth. And I will mention that can't discount inflation. Inflation in 2023 was well over 4% in our cost structure. As we go into 2024, I expect to see inflation maybe be half of that impact. So that's going to be another area of tailwind. So, thanks for the question, David. David Vernon : That's helpful. And maybe just to squeeze one in here on the CSR purchase. Obviously, you're going to be adding depreciation on the rent side. Is there any sort of like net benefit of owning that property versus just renting, or is this just more about avoiding future lease payments? Mark George : Yeah. Look, I think the biggest issue is these costs could have quickly run away from us upon lease renewal. We did not control what the lease rate was going to be. We knew that, that would go to arbitration and it could be a significant multiple of where we were. So, it's really a benefit when you think about what it could be on the go forward, overall. There is some above-the-line benefits that we have in our depreciation today, that lesson, as well as the rent payment that goes away. But again, the interest burden and a pause on share repurchase provides a temporary hurdle for us. All right, we've got it wrong. We got another question before we wrap up here. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Walter Spracklin : Yeah. Thanks for squeezing me in here. So, Alan, I just want to understand again, at the end of the day here, you're talking about top-tier volume growth at industry-competitive margins. And when I look at industry-competitive margin, say, consensus estimates for next year, it's in the 60% to 61% range of OR for each of these -- each of your peers. And even if they do nothing and they don't move in their OR at all and I just take the midpoint of your 100 basis points to 150 basis points, I mean that's six years before you can get to industry-competitive margins. So, is that what we're communicating here? Is that the setup? Or we just look -- am I looking at it the wrong way? And maybe you can help me there. Alan Shaw : [Bascome] (ph), we've given you a roadmap for the next three years on how we're going to narrow the gap with our peers with respect to margin. Our commitment is industry-competitive margins. We've given you an outline of where we're headed based where we see markets. If there's more lift in the freight market, then I fully expect we're going to outperform, because our investments in safety and service and our ability to attract growth in the fastest-growing markets and the most service-sensitive markets are going to yield outsized benefits to Norfolk Southern and our shareholders during an upcycle But we're not calling that yet. Operator : Thank you. Our final question this morning comes from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna International Group. Please proceed with your question. Bascome Majors : Hey, Mark, you've been candid about the lumpy legal outflows and the insurance inflows on the cash flow front you're going to see from the Eastern Ohio incident and how that's going to be with you for some time here. But as we think about the cost structure, can you talk a little more about the ongoing operating cost increases that came from that and how fully burdened what we saw in the fourth quarter was for that and what may still be ahead? And I'm thinking things like insurance premiums or depreciation or say maintenance or testing contracts, but really anything you can share on the ongoing cost increase and how far along we are in that process would be really helpful. Thank you. Mark George : So, I'm interpreting the question beyond the East Palestine specific impacts that we reported and kind of the aftereffects of it that are in the operating results. And I'll ask Paul to help, but clearly there were impacts that consequential from East Palestine where we accelerated those train make-up, little changes that certainly had an impact in the second quarter and probably going into the third quarter. I think we've ingested that now, and that's no longer really providing any adverse -- adding adverse impact. We have installed more additional wayside detectors that we're carrying. We're doing more testing. We've got some more people monitoring our wayside deaths, et cetera. I wouldn't say that the incremental direct safety costs that come out of EP are consequential. And frankly, I think ultimately they're going to yield to better results in the go forward, because we are running a safer railroad. We're having a much better derailment experience in terms of less frequency, as a result of some of the operational changes, including the make-up rules have had. So, overall, there's probably some -- for sure, some lingering incremental cost, because we're doing things different, but there will be a benefit longer term. Paul, do you want to add anything? Paul Duncan : Yeah, I'll just add to -- thanks, Mark. The proof is in the pudding that we saw a 42% reduction in our mainline accident rate this year. So, as Alan described, part of our strategy has been to safely deliver reliable and resilient service, and 2023 was a challenging year for us, but those are the types of things that are going to move the needle in driving towards \"We have a safer, more resilient product on the railroad.\" So yes, there are going to be some of those costs as Mark just outlined very well that remain embedded, with the offset being, we're going to see and deliver a safer product for our customers and through the communities we serve. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Shaw for final comments. Alan Shaw : Thank you for joining us today. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

It is now my pleasure to introduce Luke Nichols, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Nichols, you may now begin. Luke Nichols : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Please note that during today's call, we will make certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to future events or future performance of Norfolk Southern Corporation, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and may differ materially from actual results. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. Our presentation slides are available at norfolksouthern.com in the Investors section, along with our reconciliation of any non-GAAP measures used today to the comparable GAAP measures, including adjusted or non-GAAP operating ratio. Please note that all references to our prospective operating ratio during today's call are being provided on an adjusted basis as referenced in our earnings release. Turning to Slide 3. It's now my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's President and Chief Executive Officer, Alan Shaw. Alan Shaw : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Norfolk Southern's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Here with me today are Mark George, our Chief Financial Officer; Ed Elkins, our Chief Marketing Officer; and our new Chief Operating Officer, John Orr. I am excited to have John on the Norfolk Southern team. John is a 40-year railroad industry veteran and a proven PSR expert who has worked with Hunter Harrison, Claude Mongeau and Keith Creel to implement PSR railroads across 3 countries. I promised you that we would focus on productivity in 2024, and we're taking action to do just that. Bringing in someone of John's caliber was another step to accelerate our operational improvement. John is going to share the progress in our operating metrics that he and his team are already driving and his plans for furthering productivity in our merchandise network to deliver immediate margin enhancement. Our strategy is about balancing service, productivity and growth with safety at its core. This strategy is anchored on a PSR-driven operating plan and designed to deliver top-tier earnings and revenue growth with industry competitive margins. When we say industry competitive margins, it has to be within 100 to 200 basis points of the industry average. Let's recall where we've been and discuss our path forward. Last year, in response to East Palestine, we prioritized investments in safety and service to protect our franchise and our shareholders, and we delivered on both fronts. We are operating one of the safest networks in North America and are producing service levels better than anything we've seen since 2019. Despite that progress, more work remains to be done to get us back to industry competitive margins. We were not delivering the productivity, and we were not running fast enough or efficiently enough. I needed to make changes to accelerate our progress and to introduce greater operational discipline into our culture. To that end, we started making organizational and process changes last fall, culminating with the recent hiring of John Orr. Now we have safely built the foundation to drive substantial gains in productivity, and we've committed to a 400 to [ 450 ] basis point OR improvement in the second half of this year. We will close that margin gap with peers. We will deliver a sub-60 operating ratio in the next 3 to 4 years, and we will do it at a safe, sustainable manner that recognizes our current operating environment and brings key constituents, including our shareholders, customers, employees and regulators along with us on our mission. We will urgently deliver productivity through disciplined operational excellence that continues to safely serve our customers, positions us to grow by meeting markets as they evolve and allows us to generate outsized returns for our shareholders. I'll now turn it over to Mark to review our first quarter financial results. Mark George : Thanks, Alan. As seen on Slide 5, our GAAP results in Q1 were impacted by 4 items that we've called out for you. Earlier in the month, we announced the $600 million agreement in principle to resolve a consolidated class action lawsuit relating to the East Palestine derailment. That addresses the most significant remaining legal exposures for our shareholders. Including other cleanup costs and insurance recoveries in the quarter, our operating income was adversely impacted by $592 million. You'll note at the bottom, another $108 million of insurance recoveries in the quarter. That brings our recoveries to date in excess of $200 million toward our $1.1 billion insurance coverage tower. Moving to the right. We told you last quarter about our initiative to drive a 7% reduction in non-agreement headcount, for which savings will begin to materialize in Q2. That initiative, along with our operations leadership change resulted in a $99 million charge. Next, our advisory costs associated with our now very public shareholder matter recorded in nonoperating. Finally, we also called out here a favorable deferred tax adjustment affecting our income tax expense. For the remaining slides, I'll speak to our adjusted results, excluding these items, as shown here on the far right. Moving to Slide 6, let's focus on the adjusted variances compared to Q1 of 2023 in the year-over-year columns. Those results were impacted by 4% lower revenues driven by meaningfully lower fuel surcharge as well as headwinds in Intermodal that Ed will detail later. Operating expenses were up 3% from inflation and the increased workforce. You'll see an OpEx year-over-year waterfall in the appendix that provides more detail. Not on this page is nonoperating income, which was down $17 million from lower gains on our company-owned life insurance. That decline, coupled with the lower operating income drove the net income and EPS reductions you see here on a year-over-year basis. Let's talk on the right side about the sequential variance from Q4 2023, where we guided to a 100 to 200 basis point deterioration in our OR, which is in line with normal seasonality. That's exactly where we landed right at the lower end of that range. On the next couple of charts, we'll detail the sequential revenue and OpEx walks from Q4. So revenue here on Slide 7 moved down sequentially driven by fuel surcharge headwinds and overall lower volumes driven by coal and Intermodal. Coal pricing was weaker and Intermodal faced difficult conditions with volumes down 3% and continued adverse mix from softness in our higher-yield premium business. Slide 8, turning to our operating expenses. They were down 1% as compared to Q4. We faced typical sequential headwinds associated with the reset of payroll taxes, and we had meaningful headwinds from returning to normal incentive compensation accrual levels as well as no property sales in the first quarter. We offset those headwinds by lower spend in purchased services, efficiency gains in comp embedded as well as favorable fuel prices. While fuel expense was down 6% sequentially, recall that surcharge revenue was down 17% sequentially, and that drives a 40 basis point OR headwind on a sequential basis. As we turn to the balance of the year, we will see our margins improve materially from here. We are finally starting to see excess service costs unwind and they will accelerate downward in Q2. That trajectory, along with the reduction in non-agreement headcount as well as other productivity initiatives leave us confident in a strong productivity story for Q2. We anticipate a modest seasonal volume lift sequentially, although there is some pressure to our Coal business from the Baltimore Bridge disruption. Despite the port closure, we still believe we will be within the first half 67% to 68% OR guidance range, assuming that the channel reopens at the beginning of June. The revenue impact from the channel closure is in the $25 million to $35 million per month range. More productivity momentum builds in the back half as well as stronger volumes, and that provides us with confidence in the 400 to 450 basis points of OR improvement. John will talk more about the productivity runway in front of us. But first, I'll hand over to Ed to discuss revenues. Ed Elkins : Thank you, Mark, and good morning to everyone on the call. Starting on Slide 11, I'll go over our commercial results for the quarter. Overall, volume grew by 4% versus last year, driven by Intermodal. Revenue for the first quarter came in just above $3 billion, down 4% year-over-year as total RPU fell 8%. Starting with merchandise, volume was flat versus last year, while revenue ticked down 1% driven by lower fuel surcharge revenue. RPU less fuel increased by 3% year-over-year setting an all-time quarterly record, which also led to a new all-time quarterly record for revenue less fuel. This marks the 35th out of the prior 36 quarters that merchandise RPU grew year-over-year, and once again, reaffirms our commitment to price and the increasing value of our service. Turning to Intermodal. Volume grew 8% year-over-year, primarily on strength in International. However, revenue decreased 8% as RPU excluding fuel and storage and fees declined by 6% overall. Revenue was also impacted by the lane rationalization across Intermodal that simplified our network. This decision demonstrates how marketing, operations and finance are aligned to increase productivity and drive smart and sustainable growth. Digging into coal, volumes for the quarter declined by 4% as weakness in the utility market was only partially offset by export strength driven by a historically strong export quarter as our cross-functional efforts to boost throughput at our Lamberts Point terminal yielded positive results. These results are a great example of NS pulling together to deliver strong value for our shareholders and for our customers. Let's move to Slide 12, where I'm introducing a new view of our results that helps frame the main first quarter drivers of revenue and revenue per unit. Overall, fuel surcharge revenue was the single largest headwind in the quarter, declining by $115 million.  The first quarter was also the last one where Intermodal storage and fees are a substantial year-over-year headwind with revenues declining by $35 million. In Coal, we experienced positive mix from higher export volumes and higher utility shipments in the South. This positive mix was more than offset by lower realized price and export shipments as seaborne coal prices weakened significantly throughout the quarter.  Merchandise revenue, excluding fuel, was driven higher by pricing gains across the entire book. Overall pricing and volume increases in our metals franchise were boosted by improved network fluidity from increased car velocity. That same velocity and fluidity helped volumes in automotive remained flat despite manufacturing headwinds at several of the plants that we serve. Intermodal revenue, excluding fuel and storage and fees increased as higher volumes more than offset adverse mix and continued slight capacity in the domestic truck market created headwinds to RPU. Higher international shipments and lower domestic premium shipments were the main drivers of adverse mix. Additionally, RPU was impacted from higher international empty shipments as these grew 57% year-over-year in the quarter. We believe elongated ocean transit times are a driving factor pushing ocean carriers to deploy their capacity back on the water as soon as possible, which increases the need to reposition empty containers back to the ports. Turning to Slide 13. Let's go over our market outlook for the remainder of '24. The macro landscape presents a mixed bag with uncertainty regarding inflation and future Fed rate actions overshadowing the recent recovery in manufacturing. However, our improving service product places us in an excellent position to capitalize on growth opportunities. Starting with our view on the widely varying merchandise markets, we generally see support from volume from the normalization of auto production and the continued strength in infrastructure projects across our network. A positive price environment will continue, which is supported by the increase in network fluidity. Improved cycle times, equipment availability and network velocity will be a broad positive tailwind across our portfolio and merchandise. And we also expect to drive incremental volumes through project development, such as our recently announced Great Lakes reload acquisition, the merger of TDIS into Triple Crown Services and continued industrial development wins. Intermodal volumes are increase as international trade remains robust. We expect continued mix impacts from higher international empty shipments as geopolitical tensions remain elevated, but a weak truck market continues to drive stubbornly low truck rates, which will dampen domestic nonpremium Intermodal pricing. Additionally, we expect volumes in our domestic premium business to fall as challenging LTL market forces reduced freight demand for parcel shipments. Finally, coal volumes will be challenged as high stockpiles and low natural gas prices reduce utility shipments. In addition, export shipments will be affected by the Baltimore port shutdown. We are diligently working with our customers to provide alternate supply chain solutions, and the increased network fluidity is providing the capacity necessary to execute on those solutions. Finally, seaborne coal prices have weakened as supply has outstripped global demand and this headwind is expected to continue throughout the remainder of the year. Before I turn it over to John, I'd like to close by making our customers for trusting Norfolk Southern to move their freight. John Orr : Thank you, Ed. I arrived at NS in late March and immediately got to work immersing myself in the operations and connecting with our people. I've had boots on the ground assessing terminals and engaging craft colleagues and frontline supervisors. I've also met with our stakeholders from labor, regulatory and community leadership. What I've seen confirms that NS is a robust franchise with a talented team and the resources to deliver impressive results when properly executed. Our safety performance as shown on Slide 15, has trended favorably. I have observed a strong safety commitment, and we are building on that. My first action as COO was a system safety blitz to provide clarity around the value of safety. Turning to Slide 16. It is imperative that we closed the profitability gap with our peers. We are now delivering encouraging trends in productivity. Our strategy is balanced. Our operating efficiency and service excellence are achieved in tandem. Our approach is a flywheel of value creation where people, processes and accountability intersect to drive performance, anchoring our service and profitability proposition. Accountability is key. We're providing our team with the metrics they need to track their performance.  In my first 30 days, we have removed approximately 200 locomotives from the available fleet. Most of these have gone into stored status or driven off-line for [indiscernible]. Our availability count is now below 2,500 units. As shown on the slide, we will be able to increase locomotive drawdown over the next 6 months. Terminal 12 has improved by 8%. We are driving more waste by fine-tuning workload in our terminals through disciplined planned execution. Near term, we are targeting 20% improvement. Car miles have improved by 8%. And this is another productivity measure, we target for double-digit improvement. Recrews are trending down 22% as network and terminal improvements are combining to improve fluidity across the main line. And lastly, we are reviewing the entire train service plan. This will drive core rationalization in the range of 4%, resulting from these initiatives. We are driving out excess cost as we close the gap to our peers. Referring to Slide 17, network update. To accelerate improvements and address network underperformance, I have established a network optimization team that identifies areas for immediate improvement. I have deployed 2 task force to drive field productivity and throughput at 2 major terminals.  The outcomes from these efforts will rapidly go out to scale throughout the network. We are training our operations leaders to think differently to make faster decisions and to eliminate waste more vigorously. My commitment is to develop PSR railroaders to instill the discipline for continuous improvement and to streamline execution by relentlessly managing assets in context to our commercial obligations. The initial results across the entire network have been promising. Our people are driving PSR results. To create accountability and to track progress, we're introducing a comprehensive set of metrics. I've laid out challenging and urgent near-term targets, and I'm taking an aggressive disciplined approach to achieve our long-term financial glide path. And I can tell you, now we have a significant runway on cost reduction. As our fleet becomes more efficient, we benefit in rents and materials by shedding assets and from improving the fleet composition and getting out more costly cars. Our locomotive fleet now has significant capacity. I believe we will be able to scale down discretionary capital spending on the fleet. And we have a robust terminal footprint, covering a rich array of industrial activity. And as we optimize our terminals, we are challenging the historic use to create value through consolidation and efficiencies. I am proud and excited to have the opportunity to lead the operations team at NS. I look forward to your questions, and I will turn the call back to Alan. Alan Shaw : Our strategy is designed to mirror the great success stories of the Canadian railroads who have recognized that PSR is about more than tearing a railroad down to its studs at slashing costs regardless of the fallout. As our Board member, Claude Mongeau, demonstrated when he was CEO of Canadian National, a PSR operating model, when part of a customer-focused balanced strategy, can deliver top-tier revenue growth and a sub-60 operating ratio. John Orr was an integral part of Claude's leadership team at CN and thus, a perfect fit from Norfolk Southern as we turbocharge productivity in pursuit of industry competitive margins and top-tier earnings growth. Core to this are the men and women of Norfolk Southern. I'm incredibly proud of all they've done to progress the execution of our differentiated strategy. So my colleagues, thank you for everything you do for Norfolk Southern, our shareholders, our customers and your fellow team members. Together, we are on a transformational journey to a safer more profitable railroad, poised for growth with strong execution from an experienced leadership team. We will now open the call to questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Brian Ossenbeck : Just wanted to understand, going back to the Meridian Speedway concession. Does that actually have an impact? Or does that cover anything related to traffic originating or terminating out of Mexico? And then secondarily, maybe something for John or the team. Can you just give us some sense behind the underlying assumptions as you're benchmarking these productivity savings going down to 60 OR in the next 2, 3 years? And why can't you go there faster? What's holding you back from that? Maybe you can help with walking through some of the assumptions under your numbers versus what else we see out there? Alan Shaw : Thanks for the question, Brian. Let me be really clear. The agreement related to the Meridian Speedway is by no means a consequential concession, and it does not impact Mexico. We said it impacts the Dallas business, which is largely defined by abundant truck capacity. John, do you want to handle the second part of his one question. John Orr : Sure. Brian, nice to talk to you. And I'll tell you, I've been out assessing the network, and I'm really confident with the plans that I've got underway today that we're on track for the 400 to 500 basis points by year-end. And I'll tell you, our operating costs are a direct reflection of our asset management. And speed and accuracy are really essential to that. And our ability to rapidly cycle assets reduces our need for them, which is why we're focused on accelerating all of our operations simultaneously while taking out costs. And I'm very confident with our dwell, our over-the-road performance, the discipline we put on our locomotive fleets and the crew productivity and some of the smart investments that we're making to unlock the value, we're well underway. Operator : Next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Scott Group : So Mark, you're guiding 400 to 500 basis points of sequential improvement into Q2. Just help us think about the drivers there? How much volume? How should we think about cost ex fuel? And there's a lot going on with the proxy. So I do want to ask also, Alan. A, what's -- any expectation in terms of timing for ISS and then there is a lot of focus on this Meridian Speedway thing. It looks like there was another a second amendment that you guys filed yesterday. Any color on what that second amendment is? Mark George : Yes, I'll start. First, I think the amendment was just really formalizing with the SEB who had requested that things get filed, the whole exchange that we want -- that we had the 8-K and some of the other stuff. They just wanted to see it formally filed. So we did exactly that. That's all it is, nothing new than what's already been communicated. ISS, we don't control it. We would imagine that comes out likely at the end of this week, early next week, but we don't know. And with regard to the Q1 to Q2 walk, Scott, really, what we would expect here is kind of the modest seasonal volume increase that you typically would see going into the second quarter, call it 1 point or 2 of increased costs. But then I think you're going to really start to see the cost lines start to show relief here, especially in comp and ben. We've started to actually experience the unwinding of service costs in March, and that's going to really accelerate into the second quarter. And I think most of those will be gone by the end of the second quarter going into the third quarter. So we've made tremendous progress there. In addition, we've got restructuring benefits, the reduction of the 300-plus non-agreement workers. Most of those have already left here in middle of April and there's a few more that leave at the end of May, but we're going to start really harvesting those benefits. And fuel is another area where we're going to see some benefits with efficiency. John is very focused on that right now. And then, of course, we've got all of the other productivity stuff that's really starting to build. The productivity related to crew start savings, over time, car rents, things like that. So you're going to see it show up in a lot of the P&L lines, especially in com and ben. Alan Shaw : And Scott, recall in John's prepared remarks, you had a chart that said about $250 million in productivity over the next 6 months. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Thomas Wadewitz : Yes. Alan, I wanted to get your thoughts on, I guess, how -- you've had a pretty big change, obviously, the new COO, who is, John stated, been very aggressive. The team has been aggressive with taking locomotives out, changing the schedule. How do you think about the risks of that? Because I think your prior approach was something where you thought it would be better for customers to kind of have the resiliency approach. So I guess how do you think about the change in tack on operations and some of the risks of going that way and I guess also recognizing that before you kind of pointed to a lot of risks of being too aggressive on the -- I guess, on reducing people and assets? Alan Shaw : Tom, thanks for the question. Let me be really clear. We we're still focused on that same strategy that we laid out a couple of years ago. And that's that balance between service productivity and growth with safety at its core. And we made a lot of improvements last year in service. We made a safer road even safer, but we weren't delivering the productivity. We weren't running fast enough, and we weren't running efficiently enough. And so I needed to make some changes, and that's what a CEO does. And I needed to accelerate our operational improvements, and we made a number of process changes and personnel changes starting last fall. Most recently, we hired John Orr and what John is doing is he's driving productivity and continued service improvements. And so that -- that's the balance of our strategy. That's what customers want. They want service and they want us to be productive. John, you got some thoughts on that? John Orr : Yes. And as I've said in my prepared remarks, they're not mutually exclusive. In fact, they're complementary to each other. And my approach is, as I evaluate the network, and restructuring our yard and local plans, what are basically on-ramps to our corridor that touch our service, touch our customers and creating efficiencies, new standards and accelerating through our current dwell times, making improvements year-over-year, but also making improvements on the individual cars and the handoffs on those cars, it drives performance. And then the overall speed of the network picks up as there's more reliability. So that's why I talk to not only our craft employees and our frontline supervisors in my first few days, but also union leadership and the regulators to make sure they understood, we're going to go at a quick pace, give them a forecast of what we're doing. And I was very clear, even with our union leadership that I'm going to ask our people to do more, give them the resources, give them the training, give them the skills to do it. But they're going to be stretched in ways that they'll be proud of in the coming years, and we're going to do it sustainably. We're going to grow a team of capable PSR-driven leadership and do it in a way that produces amazing results. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Jonathan Chappell : John, I want to follow up on a couple of things that have been touched on already as it relates to the things that you've done in the last 30 days. The volumes so far this quarter have been relatively strong for Norfolk Southern, on a year-over-year basis, [indiscernible] easy comps. But as you go through the next 6 months and you deal with things like laying off 300 more locomotives or reducing merchandise families by 10%, is there a situation where you don't maybe chase volume recovery as quickly as you would otherwise? Or it's more about getting the network where it needs to be and worrying about volume and I guess, the top line beyond that next 6-month period? Alan Shaw : John, why don't you talk about that? And then, Ed, why don't you talk about the market? John Orr : Yes. I think that the most imperative thing we can do is to close the gap on performance, reliability and drive the value of the network. As far as the capacity, we're unlocking capacity in the existing terminals by being more efficient, more effective and driving those on-ramps to the network more effectively. What are in that pipeline? We have ample capacity to grow more trains or grow longer trains to get yield out of that even a single line capacity. So I don't see it as being one or the other. It's both. And whether or not the volume is there, depending on what the economy gives, we're going to drive performance, we're going to close the gap faster than anyone else. So Ed, I'll turn it to you. Ed Elkins : Sure. And you're absolutely right, John. We've seen volume so far this month and we're encouraged by that. Our customers are encouraged by the level of service that we're delivering. And to be clear, in Intermodal, the level of service we're delivering is the best in a generation and it's sustainable and it's going to continue to be that way, and we're earning trust from our customers to do that. We're seeing very good response on the bid front for new volume converting from the highway, which we're very encouraged by in Intermodal. On the merchandise side, look, we spent the last 6 months building a sales conversion pipeline, which includes technology augmentation as well as institutional rigor and we are going to deliver growth from highway converting freight in the merchandise space that should be moving on Norfolk Southern. The capacity that John is unlocked and we're going to use to go out and get back the freight that should be ours. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Justin Long : I guess to follow up on some of the commentary about Intermodal. You've talked about rationalizing some lanes. I wanted to get an update on where you are in that process? Is that now complete? Or is there more to come? And then similarly or along those lines, thinking about these multi-year OR targets, how do you envision the mix of the business changing? Do we need to see a shift to more general merchandise freight? Or is that not necessary to hit these OR objectives? Ed Elkins : I'll talk about the Intermodal piece first. I think that was your first question. Look, we took a very, very disciplined view of our Intermodal network and did a couple of things. Looked at lanes that were very low density, looked at lanes that were not strategic in terms of their capability for our customers, and then thirdly, looked at lanes where we did not believe that there was going to be long-term growth potential that we have line of sight on. Once we pass all those filters, we talked to our partners that were engaged in those lanes that includes our port partners and some others, and we made some tough decisions. It's about 15% of the Intermodal lane portfolio, but only about of the Intermodal revenue portfolio, which should tell you something about the density there. Are we done? We're always looking at our network to make sure that we are applying our resources where the greatest growth potential is. And one thing that this exercise taught us is we can redeploy some of that capacity that we're freeing up toward our powerhouse lanes where we're delivering exceptional value for our customers. Mark George : And I would say with regard to kind of the mix question. Intermodal is going to grow because that's where the growth is. We serve the consumers. But at the same time, merchandise has probably suffered more in the past couple of years from the service challenges we have. So just unlocking the network and doing everything that John is doing, should enable Merchandise to really return to better growth rates as we start to recover, and of course, that will help mix. Ed Elkins : Absolutely. And the -- as I said, the sales pipeline approach that we're taking has a very disciplined view toward conversion from the high labels in the Merchandise as well as the Intermodal space. John Orr : And I would say as far as capacity is concerned, we're improving execution and plan compliance, and that facilitates blocking deeper into our network, which ultimately increases car velocity, train speed and really drives performance. That applies to Intermodal, Merchandise and [ Boat ]. And we're actively engaging and challenging every asset that we've got out there. Just in the last 30 days, I've approved the elimination of over 487 turnouts that were redundant. We're turning over every rock, big or small, to look for improvement and consistency. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen. Jason Seidl : John, I wanted to talk a little bit about the new PTO and sick leave regulations and how much of an impact that you've seen there and sort of what you expect going forward? And I guess a quick follow-up is when you look at sort of the whole network, how are you viewing some of the yards? And is there a chance that you look to close a yard or two down the road? John Orr : Yes. Obviously, the sick leave is a national issue. I think no different than any other regulated or introduced crew limitation, we all have to deal with it. What I'm really focused on is crew productivity and yard productivity and increasing the capabilities of each assignment to do more within the time frame they've got to work. And so delivering more, getting accountability to connections, getting yield on our trains, that's the most important piece, and we're balancing that. I'm on the team every day on crew availability to make sure that whatever we've committed to with our labor organizations or through the CBA process that we're living up to that. And on the flip side, making sure that the unions understand that they have an obligation to come to work within the time frames, dressed and ready to deliver for our customers each and every day. So it's both sides of that coin. As far as the terminals are concerned, the reason why I started with hump yards is because they can add a lot of value. They can drive a lot of mechanized performance. But as we all know, they're costly. I want to get the most yield I can get out of them. I've already challenged our yard plan from yard to yard, node to node. And we've started to eliminate power imbalances at a place like Chattanooga. We've reduced the bunching in the terminals by reestablishing a terminal clock at all of the major terminals. And we've even decreased a number of assignments that were moving cars and causing multiple handlings between the yards. So I would say everything is open. I'm challenging the historic reason for a yard so that whatever we do is going to meet the operational need of today and tomorrow. So everything is on the table. Everything is being scrutinized, and we will be rolling out a redefined yard operating plan and yard operating strategies in the next 30 days. And that will then drive or redesign of most of the operating plan over the next 60 to 90 days. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research. Jeffrey Kauffman : John, just kind of a question on your impression coming in. As you were an outsider, you had a certain view of what Norfolk might not have been able to do. Now you're an insider, you've had a chance to see an operation. I guess my question is twofold. Number one, what's different about when you actually came on board and got a chance to get out there and see what's going on. And then my second aspect of that is, what do you think somebody on the outside might not appreciate about the Norfolk network and what can and can't be done? John Orr : Well, that's a great question. I'm glad you asked it. I'll tell you, in my first official act with boots on the ground was to go to East Palestine and really understand the scope of that issue. I'll tell you, I've been a railroader for over 40 years. I've been the incident commander at a number of derailments, some very consequential and some that I've had to make those same decisions that were made here to resolve imminent safety concerns. And understanding the scope and scale of the commitment that NS has made to that community, I've never experienced anything like that. And so I came in with a bias and really had to understand the magnitude of that event and how that could have had a more lasting impact across not only NS, but the sector. As I looked at our operations, I always have a bias for yards because I think yards, especially in a merchandise environment where cars and customers kind of coincide. So how we handle them, how do we accelerate or drag is really important to evaluate. And so I was pleasantly surprised at the richness of the terminals, but also quickly realized as I got under the hood that that was where a lot of the underperformance was happening. And that's why I set up a task force to kind of look at the data and drive performance through data, but also had a field component to check in a balance to make sure that we were driving was actually going to add performance and not undermined or burn something down that didn't need to be, either intentionally or unintentionally. So I think having a good perspective of what the network looks like, as an outsider, you have biases. As an insider, you start to get under the hood and realize, okay, here may be a big rock issue, but then you get to know the smaller rocks that need to be moved out of the way to create that momentum. I've made a career out of going across Canada and the United States and Mexico, unclogging drains and creating a lot of momentum and then leveraging that momentum to build very competent, capable service plans; very competent, capable operators of those service plans; and creating sustained improvements. And that's what I'm seeing right now. I think the architecture of NS is solid and it does come down to execution, and it's a very complex nonlinear network. That's what the east is all about. I've spent 35 of my 40 years in the east, either a craft employee or as a leader, as a senior leader in the United States, a senior leader in Eastern Canada. And I mean I know networks, I know the industrial complex that we're working in. It's very similar to the density that I just converted in Mexico. So I think we've got lots of work to do. But as I said in my prepared remarks, it's a robust franchise with a talented team and the resources to deliver impressive results. We just have to properly execute. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Stephanie Benjamin Moore : I appreciate the color, especially from you, John, on just the detailed plans in place around productivity initiatives and creating a PSR mindset across the organization. With this focus as a clear priority, what has been the customer response just given the changes underway. How does this translate into incremental volumes? Is there a natural lag from customers? Does they kind of get convinced of the changes happening? Any color there would be helpful. Alan Shaw : Ed, why don't you address that? Ed Elkins : Sure. And thank you, Stephanie, for the question. As I said earlier, our customers are encouraged by a couple of things. Number one, the velocity of change that they see happening in terms of service improvement. And you think about our first quarter, we absorbed double-digit growth in our international book as well as low single-digit growth in our domestic book, held serve on our merchandise freight and improved service throughout that time and into April. So they're encouraged. On the Intermodal front, like I said, it's really the best service in a generation that we're delivering. And I have a lot of confidence that we're going to continue to deliver that same level of service, which is only going to deliver more value for our customers. On the merchandise side, in some cases, our customers are going to have to unwind alternatives that they've got in place. But you know what, have an exceptional service that is reliable and really just a conveyor belt, that's what they want. That's what allows them to unwind those alternatives and come back to where the natural value for them is, which is Norfolk Southern. Alan Shaw : You know, I've had a number of customers approach me, Stephanie, over the last month since John was announced, encouraged by our approach, encouraged by our direction and supporting our strategy. Our customers, as John noted, in the east are familiar with John in large part. And they've seen what he's done, wherever he's been to enhance service and enhance safety and enhance productivity, and that's what customers are looking for. Ed, I don't know if you know it, but just this morning, we got an e-mail from one of our largest customers, thanking us for another excellent week of service. Ed Elkins : I was just about to close that. Thank you for another week of excellent service. You know who you are out there. John Orr : And we've had to make hard decisions. Ed and I have had to try to take very decisive decisions on car flows, even on how customers are interacting with some of our service facilities. It is -- but having the work on the front end, engaging with people, helping them understand what we're doing, helping them understand where they fit into that, whether it's union leaders, it's regulatory leaders or our customers, that really, Stephanie, helps them understand what we're doing, why we're doing it and how we're going to work together to create these standards. Alan Shaw : And Stephanie, that is our strategy, is making sure that we bring along our customers and our employees and our regulators and our shareholders with us as we transform Norfolk Southern into a more profitable organization with a safe and service product that is poised for growth. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Jordan Alliger : Yes, maybe, this is in some ways a follow-up, but I'm just sort of curious. You have a pretty extensive list of things to do over the next 6 months and then 12 to 24 months. As you sort of come in, knowing what Norfolk had done already per you getting there and the gap that's been talked about. How much of this would you say, as what you would call basic blocking and tackling versus real sea changes in operational scope? Basically trying to assess your degree of confidence level in achieving and kicking all these things off and being able to hit the margin expectations in the coming years. John Orr : Well, I'll tell you this, that all across Canada, the U.S. and Mexico, I've been a change agent and an architect of PSR. I haven't had the luxury of looking in the rearview mirror very often. And so I don't spend a lot of time looking at what could have been or what was rather than what the current situation is and how fast can we get to the desired state. Desired state is having -- closing the gap for sure, having an operation that is focused on asset management with speed and accuracy to reduce the cycle times, reduce the dwell times and drive out waste.  So that's taking on an approach where it has a network overview. So there's a very strategic point of view on how do we create speed, accuracy by reducing dwell, increasing over-the-road performance, looking at long lead resources like locomotives and crews and how do we meet them as productive as we can and then create resiliency and elasticity for network response like we've seen in Baltimore. And then really look at our smart investments, how do we leverage those things like capitalizing locomotive renewals, refurbishing locomotives that can be pushed off into the future because we're creating our own locomotives by having them more productive. I think this is a natural evolution on some of the linear elements that were started in the past. Now taking a multidimensional point of view on it, not focusing on one particular thing, but elevating the entire suite of operating efficiencies at the same time in tandem with one another. Disciplined railroading, disciplined service, accurate handling of cars and reduction of waste and cost is really the plan. And that will show in the form of yard operating plans, disciplined operations and terminals, disciplined and progressive ways of moving the train service plan to the meet the commercial needs of today. I am highly confident, highly confident that we'll achieve the targets and we'll do it in a way that's sustainable and we'll do it in a way that fosters growth and we are on the path today. We're well underway. So that increased my confidence. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital. Walter Spracklin : I know you've put a lot of time under this, but I do need to come back to it and that is the -- trying to square up the changes that John is making here. They are substantial with the lack of any customer disruption. It used to be, and maybe I'm dating myself here, but it used to be when I ride, we saw PSR change. It didn't -- if customers weren't disrupted, then it wasn't happening, was kind of the view. And when you take out 200 locomotives, soon to be 500 locomotives, I mean that kind of has to have leave a mark. We know there's been lane reductions, I guess, feedback from those customers must have been quite negative. So I just -- just wondering, are you just refocusing on those other customers and you're getting good service to them, and they're coming back to you with some good feedback and perhaps some of the less or lower-margin customers are going to be shed a little bit? Just really surprised that we're not hearing more customer blowback from some of these significant and important changes that you're making. Alan Shaw : Walter, that's our strategy. That's what we're committed to doing. We're going to implement and we have been implementing PSR in a responsible and sustainable manner. We saw what happened in our peer in 2017. And we're not tearing this thing down to the studs. John knows how to do it without tearing it down to the studs as the activist COO has said he would have to do. Ed is close to our customers. Our customers appreciate and see the improved service. We're focused on safety, and we're focused on a sustainable plan for Norfolk Southern that drives long-term shareholder value. John, you want to talk about how you're doing this in the right way. John Orr : And I think Walter, by the way, it's nice to hear from you. I would say, it's what we said at the very onset, that we're taking a balanced approach. I've laid out really challenging and urgent near-term and midterm targets and I'm taking an aggressive disciplined approach to manage it. And I view as the George Foreman Grill example, you don't set and forget operations. You sweat it out and you can't drive this alone. So creating a team of capable railroaders focused on the big rocks and small rocks at the same time, delivering the fundamental of safety, creating stability across the network and then challenging every asset that we have, every standard that we have and building compliance and building momentum around those things is really important. So yes, it is sweat equity in a lot of respects, Walter. And it is really the key focus areas of yard time and dwell and you know what that does. When we drive our current dwell down from mid-'23s to '22, and we'll be taking that down even further. Not only are we handling the cars better in the terminals, but we're getting more cars on trains, getting to the customers sooner. And even the bad order count, taking it down by double digits -- by almost 50%, means those -- the discipline of handling those cars in the terminal and getting them back into the flow of our core service offerings, customers are seeing those cars faster than they would have otherwise seen them. So I would think that they see that as a value and rather than a negative disruption, a positive indication that we're building momentum and commitment to them while at the same time reducing handlings and costs. Mark George : And just to close a loop, Walter, on say the locomotive specifically. Remember last year, we actually had to add locomotives back into service. We spent a fair amount of money in materials, trying to get locomotives that have been stored, back up and running so we could dig out of the top hole we were in following the East Palestine derailment. It's how we got service really back on the right trajectory. And now we're able to start attacking some of those resiliency costs we've added and remove locomotives and some of the other costs we had to throw at the system. So there's a lot of opportunity here to remove costs that will be nondisruptive to the customers. Alan Shaw : And to summarize, the service level improvements, the dramatic service level improvements and what the customers are reacting to, and that is across our markets and across our customer base. Operator : Our next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. David Vernon : So John, you've been at the property a little over a month. I'd love to kind of get your perspective on kind of what the root cause is here that you see as far as kind of what drove the problems? Is it a question of kind of what Norfolk was trying to do or how they were doing it? And kind of any thoughts you have on that would be helpful. And then as you think about kind of taking 200 locomotives out, maybe another 300 locomotives. What is that for headcount? Because I would assume that the sequential headcount number was up a little over 500. Obviously, the non-craft trades -- the non-craft job action coming out, a couple of hundred heads will be down. But what are you thinking about the operating head count as you start to free up assets and run more fluidly? Mark George : Actually, I'll handle the headcount question before John talks to you a little bit about his assessment of the challenges. You may recall, we guided last time where we said overall headcount would likely be flat over the course of the year. We were taking 300 non-agreement people out, but we would likely have to add some agreement folks that would offset it. We actually see now with John in the room here, a pathway for total headcount to be down around 2% by the time we end the year. So that's the path on headcount. John? John Orr : Yes. And just to add emphasis to that. As we get more productivity out of our yard and locos and more accuracy on our over-the-road transits and performance, we'll see more people virtually come alive, and we'll be able to have more availability and more crew flexibility. And I have frozen all hiring from operations. There may be 1 or 2 critical paths like C&S where -- signals and communications. That's a very specialized scale that we will need to continue to evolve as we bring our OT and IT and that kind of perspective into -- more into our safety plans. But I would also say that it gets back to the basics. I'm not going to really be too critical of what I inherited. Rather, I saw a lot of things in flight that I'm able to leverage very quickly on. And at the same time, the basics of railroading, the basics of giving a great service plan at the lowest cost in the safest way possible is the recipe and building out discipline around that, creating visibility, accountability and driving purpose so that we improve these things is part of the challenge that I've laid out. And that's how we're delivering short term and midterm, and that's what we're going to continue to do. Operator : At this time, we've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call back over to Luke Nichols for closing comments. Luke Nichols : Thanks, Rob. Appreciate everyone's time and joining our call this morning. I recognize there's a few folks that didn't get a chance to ask your questions. I want to let you know Investor Relations is here through the rest of the day. Please feel free to reach out to us. We look forward to seeing everybody through the quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.",

Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded on Thursday, July 25, 2024. I would now like to turn the conference over to Luke Nichols, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Luke, please go ahead. Luke Nichols : Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Please note that during today's call, we will make certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the of the safe harbor provision Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to future events for future performance of Norfolk Southern Corporation, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and may differ materially from actual results. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for full disclosure of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. Our presentation slides are available at norfolksouthern.com in the Investors section, along with our reconciliation of any non-GAAP measures used today to the comparable GAAP measures, including adjusted or non-GAAP operating ratio. Please note that all references to our prospective operating ratio during today's call are being provided on an adjusted basis as referenced in our earnings release. Turning to Slide 3, it's now my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's President and Chief Executive Officer, Alan Shaw. Alan Shaw : Thank you, Luke, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. Here with me today are John Orr, our Chief Operating Chief Operating Officer; Ed Elkins, our Chief Marketing Officer; and Mark George, our Chief Financial Officer. Earlier, we reported our second quarter financial results, including adjusted quarter adjusted operating income of $1.1 billion, net income of $694 million, and diluted earnings per share of $3.06. Notably, we delivered 480 basis points of sequential margin improvement on our adjusted operating ratio. OR was 65.1% in the second quarter, with a first half OR of 67.5%, making good on our commitment to our shareholders to a first half operating ratio in the range of 67% to 68%. Our strong progress over this quarter demonstrates our ability to close the gap to our peers by executing our balanced strategy of service, productivity, and growth with safety at its core. The Thoroughbred team delivered significant margin improvement in the quarter despite revenue headwinds, by accelerating productivity initiatives. As you will hear from John, Ed, and Mark, we were able to overcome market weakness through increasingly strong progress on our six key operational metrics by responding to market opportunities and growing volume and remaining laser focused on controlling costs. We also take seriously our commitment to being the gold standard of safety in the industry and continue to make progress on improving our safety culture and metrics. This is the strength of our strategy, driving operable excellence and discipline that will deliver and will continue to deliver productivity gains and create the foundation to onboard significant growth when the market returns. This is the flywheel effect that is delivering tangible benefits for customers and shareholders. Efficient operations with a compelling service product allowed our teams to gain share in service-sensitive markets such as auto and intermodal, while participating in spot opportunities in coal and agriculture. As a result, we posted record performance in several key merchandise measures. While our work continues, our second quarter results represent an encouraging inflection point in our operating performance. We have plenty of runway in front of us. I'm excited for Norfolk Southern's opportunities ahead. We're committed to our strategy and delivering the results with pace and urgency that demonstrate the power of a better way for our employees, customers, communities and shareholders. I'll now turn it over John to further discuss our operational progress. John Orr : Thank you, Alan. It's a pleasure to provide an update on our progress. Turning to Slide 5. At NS, safety enables performance and our commitment to safety is unwavering. During the quarter, we leveraged our NS leadership framework to strengthen our field safety. We continued our efforts to focus on mainline accident reductions and we commissioned three additional inspection portals and added field sensors. These have contributed to our best-in-class mainline accident rate. We also conducted two cross-functional leadership safety summits, strengthening our capabilities and reinforcing safety from the ballast to the boardroom. Turning to Slide 6. Our metrics improved across all of our core network performance indices. Our balanced approach proved safety, service and cost improvements work best together. Year-to-date, we have reduced our active online motor power fleet by 320 locomotives and have targeted an additional 100 reductions in the second half. As we store locomotives, we use reliability metrics to remove the worst performers, driving up overall fleet reliability and driving down maintenance, materials and fuel expense. Quarter-over-quarter, we increased our GTMs for available horsepower by 6% and our car velocity by 6%. Both improvements are the result of design processes that drive out time and cost, both in terminals and over the road. Our strategy includes structural improvements in fuel procurement, materials management, purchase service optimization, crew cost efficiency and productivity enhancements. So let's take a look at a few of the initiatives in the pipeline that are closing the gap as we track for the $250 million cost takeout commitment. Turning to Slide 7. We have delivered a 6% improvement in car velocity by reducing handlings, extending train schedules and improving connection performance. Car velocity is something I monitor closely. It captures improvements in our operating plan, terminal execution and over-the-road performance. For example, during the quarter, we eliminated over 700 unnecessary car handlings per day. Driving car velocity in response to overall train speed improvements includes working with our customers to rightsize the inventory in their pipelines as train speed and car velocity improve, fewer cars are required to service the current volume. In the quarter, we delivered a reduction of 3% of cars online. We are improving safety, train speed and service reliability by addressing unscheduled train stops and dispatching practices. For example, our mechanical war rooms root cause analysis of every unscheduled train stop has resulted in an 18% reduction of fees and scheduled stops in Q2. We have a new network operations watchdog team, bringing extreme discipline to planned adherence. They challenged the root cause for every extra train. This has instilled network-wide visibility and accountability to execution and planning. I'm really encouraged that this has increased connections and train yield and has driven out extra train starts from 200 in March to just 50 in June. These improvements to our operating plan and terminal discipline have resulted in a 4% reduction in crew starts. The combination of crew and overtime reductions has dropped our crew expense per kGTM by 8% compared to Q1. As operational effectiveness grows, we are recalibrating our standards and sweating the network resources even further. This is the path to at least 7% to 10% improvement in car velocity. Yard and local redesigns are underway. We driving out waste and rework in the first mile and last mile operations. We are unlocking the capacity to take on additional work within the same footprint. Efficiency in this space is really important to me since we allocate approximately 50% of crew starts here. Over the next 24 months, we will continue to improve fuel productivity. We will continue to push locomotives, leverage trip optimizer to assertively manage horsepower per ton, turn power more quickly, improve fuel distribution and vendor accountability and increased train size. We are targeting locomotive productivity improvements of an additional 8%. One of my personal objectives is to develop the next generation of skilled PSR railroaders and to build the bench strength to sustain the improvements that I'm leading. We are structuring the organization to drive the daily and strategic outcomes, and I am proud and encouraged by the engagement of people in every department and across the entire organization. The team is working collaboratively and with confidence. Our team is energized and motivated to build upon the strength of the quarter and deliver the next wave of initiatives that will yield savings in all P&L categories beyond just comp and bang, but in materials, rents and purchased services, success breeds success. I want to close out my remarks on Slide 8 and 9 with two flywheel examples of balancing service and cost. In automotive, our car velocity increased by 16%, creating the platform for growth as our carloads increased by 7%. Within intermodal, shipments and service performance simultaneously increased by 8%. This following the 15% lane rationalization we discussed earlier this quarter. And what's really important to me is that we are launching our NS intermodal reservation system in September. This smooth strain demand reduces rents and expenses and creates service certainty. Our customers are enjoying some of the best sustained service ever. At the same time, we have consolidated train starts, streamlined our service plan, reduced handling complexity and have driven out cost. We are unlocking tremendous value within our franchise, adding new capability, urgently eliminating waste and driving to a sub-60 OR. Now, I'll turn it over to Ed. Ed Elkins : Hey, thank you, John, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. Let's go to Slide 11, and I'll review our commercial results for the second quarter. Overall results were driven by a notably more fluid network that delivered a better service product to our customers. Revenues came in just above $3 billion, a 2% increase versus last year. Volumes rose 5%, led by an 8% increase in intermodal, while RPU fell 3%, driven by unfavorable impacts from intermodal mix. Merchandise revenue improved 4% while volumes increased 2% and RPU rose 3%. RPU less fuel increased 4% versus last year, which once again set an all-time record alongside a new all-time record for revenue less fuel. This marks the 36th out of the prior 37 quarters, where merchandise RPU less fuel grew year-over-year. In Intermodal, revenue was flat. Volume increased 8%, and RPU declined 8%. And in coal, revenue declined 3% on a 2% volume decrease. Now these were impacted by the outage of the Francis Scott Bridge in Baltimore. I do want to take a second here to reflect on Kohl's performance in the face of extraordinary challenges around the unprecedented closure of the Baltimore port complex in April. We and our customers demonstrated extraordinary operational agility and creativity to keep global supply chains intact via Lamberts Point, Virginia until service was restored in Baltimore. I'll note that propelling our record merchandise less fuel in the quarter was our automotive book, which set a record for total revenue and RPU less fuel. Metals, achieved an all-time quarterly record an all-time revenue less fuel and chemicals, which marked an all-time record for RPU less fuel. Intermodal revenue was flat in the quarter. However, if we exclude pressure from fuel and storage charges, revenues grew by 2% despite the mix and price headwinds. All of these superlatives are supported the strong service product that John and his team are delivering. Let's turn to Slide 12 and review our outlook for the rest for the rest of 2024. We're lowering our expectations for full year revenue growth to around 1% based on continuing market cost currents, and we expect overall adverse mix headwinds to continue. In merchandise, new industrial activity may be constrained by higher interest rates and borrowing costs, but we expect to see continued benefits from ongoing infrastructure and manufacturing projects underway. Our improved network fluidity will also deliver growth and unlock shareholder value. Intermodal volumes remain a driver of overall volume growth as international shipments rise through import and export demand while excess capacity and weak truck prices are expected to remain headwinds to domestic volumes. And finally, in coal, we foresee a challenged environment within the utility space continuing, while export markets see some momentum from the reopening of the Baltimore channel and new production. All right. Let's finish up on Slide 13. I'm going to take a minute to highlight a recent win-win with a large met coal producer in producer in the US. Set to be developed 2025, our rail lines will link this new coal production facility with the global market. This mine will produce will produce nearly 5 million short tons of premium grade in met-coal annually when it reaches full production. This new partnership is a concrete example of our strategy to grow high-quality carload revenue, close the gap to peers in key markets and significantly enhance our met coal portfolio for years and years to come. This win also demonstrates our customers' confidence in Norfolk Southern in our service and our commitment to our strategy. We're grateful to be chosen for this project, and we're excited for the future of this opportunity. Investing strategic capital to support regions of our network with economic growth is also in motion. The State of Alabama is an example where our investments include terminal and mainline infrastructure projects that support customers as they invest and expand their businesses. These investments are a key part of our balanced approach to deliver top-tier revenue growth over the long term. And finally, I just want to thank our customers for their business. I'll now turn it over to Mark to cover our financial results. Mark George : Thanks, Ed and good afternoon everyone. Let's start on Slide 15 with a quick reconciliation of GAAP results on the left and the adjusted results on the right. You'll see that the Eastern Ohio incident Eastern Ohio incident column is actually income in the quarter of $65 column as our $156 million of insurance recoveries exceeded the additional costs that were accrued. In the restructuring column, you will also see income as we booked a favorable true-up to our Q1 separation cost accruals, but also realized an associated favorable postretirement curtailment adjustment within our other income line item. We also highlight under the advisory cost column, expenses incurred in Q2 associated with a proxy context. Adjusted results, including a 65.1% OR was in line with our guidance range. EPS of $3.06 was aided by $0.05 below the line from a favorable state income tax adjustment. On the next chart, Slide 16, I'll go through the year-over-year and sequential variances compared to the adjusted results. Our second quarter performance was a function of dose of revenue lift combined with the team making excellent progress on network performance and providing strong service that enabled us to remove cost from our structure. Year-over-year revenue was up $64 million or 2%, with volumes up 5%, but RPU was down 3%. As Ed discussed, adverse mix remained a headwind to RPU in the quarter. Operating expenses were down $7 million year-over-year despite inflation headwinds, reflecting strong momentum on cost takeout, which drove 160 basis points of OR improvement. The cost reduction momentum is especially evident when looking at the sequential decline of $119 or 6% on $40 million more revenue combining to drive up a large 480 basis point sequential reduction in our operating ratio and will most certainly result in a sharp narrowing of the OR gap with the industry. Drilling into the revenue change on Slide 17, focusing here on the sequential increase in revenue from Q1 of $40 million. That was driven by merchandise volume growth. Yet despite what appears as a favorable mix shift at the high level, with a 2% rise in merchandise volume, RPU to Q1 was only flat, and that's because mix within each business line was adverse, as you'll see illustrated in the gray box where volume growth of below average RPU business lines exceed volume growth in the above average business lines. Shifting to a sequential look at operating expense on Slide 18. I'll start by saying it's nice to see all green on this chart. OpEx is down $119 million versus the first quarter. The dramatic acceleration in our network velocity has allowed us to drive out the remaining service mitigation costs in the quarter, which shows up in several categories, including comp and ben, most notably over time, but also in equipment rents, purchase services as well as other. The ops team did a terrific job speeding up the network and improving service to deliver on these cost savings, as well as fuel efficiency improvements. You'll also see savings in the comp and ben from lower employee levels, largely driven from the previously announced downsizing actions that we took in our management ranks, but also sequential attrition of nearly 2% of our T&E workforce. Property gains in the second quarter totaled $25 million compared to zero in Q1, so the first half is pretty much on a normal annual run rate. Real estate transactions are lumpy, and some of you may say that the $25 million in the quarter was 2x a theoretically smoothed amount, but either way you choose to evaluate our results, our OR performance in the quarter was in line with our commitment. So we are very encouraged at what is clearly an inflection point in our cost structure, allowing us to meet the commitment we made on OR despite a weaker volume environment than we had been planning for, demonstrating organizational agility. As we look to the second half, there are various headwinds and tailwinds to consider. Ed noted that the revenue will be softer than we previously expected, with some sequential volume improvement, but adverse mix. And the industry's next contractual wage increase that took effect on July 1 creates a $25 million step up in comp and ben here in the third quarter. However, John talked about our actions and momentum on productivity side within operations, and that will help neutralize the wage impact. All that said, the key message I want to leave you with today is that despite softer macro conditions, we are reaffirming our guidance for the second half operating ratio in the 64% to 65% range. Before I hand to Alan, I'll make a comment on capital. Many of you have seen that with PSR, there is often a liberation of excess capital assets. That boosts efficiency and creates incremental cash flow streams, adding to shareholder returns. We've had some of those in the past several years with some larger asset sales, and we continue to evaluate opportunities and have a robust list of properties for which we are pursuing sales that will simplify our network and generate cash over the next several quarters. Alan? Alan Shaw : Thanks Mark. Let's turn to Slide 20. As you heard from Ed, we lowered our full-year revenue guidance from approximately 3% to approximately 1% growth. And you heard from John and Mark that we're overcoming the revenue drop with a focus on the significant productivity opportunities in front of us, which gives us the confidence in reaffirming our full year OR guidance, despite the lower revenue outlook. The momentum demonstrated in the second quarter is a testament to the strength of our strategy. I want to thank all 20,000 of my Norfolk Southern teammates for all they have done and are doing every single day to deliver on our shareholder commitments and accelerate our operational improvements. John, Ed, and Mark have identified specific actions and outcomes to deliver improved results in workforce, T&E, fuel, mechanical, purchase services and rents capital productivity as well as smart growth in merchandise, intermodal and coal. We have a clear line of sight on multiple initiatives and a road map for margin gains in several key areas over the next 18 months as we close the OR gap. I'm proud of our progress in the second quarter, encouraged by our trajectory and confident in our team's ability to execute and deliver results in the quarters ahead. We will now open the call to questions. Operator? Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] First call we have is Tom Wadewitz from UBS. Tom, go ahead. Tom Wadewitz : Yes. Good afternoon. Ed, you highlighted a number of the yield ex-fuel records and the performance in merchandise. So I wanted to ask you about intermodal yield. Are we seeing intermodal yields at a bottom? Or are there potential drivers that they go down further? And how do you think about the opportunity and the timing to see stronger pricing and revenue per unit in the Intermodal business? Ed Elkins : Thanks, man. Let me walk you through the -- really the price and mix story in intermodal. Mix and price make up around 6 and 7 points in weakness that you saw there. And that mix is really driven in the premium segment where lower part counts or are really pressuring our carriers to keep their unionized road fleets employed. The other mix piece is we're seeing a lot of empty shipments. On the Intermodal side, we're seeing them and have seen them really all year long in the Intermodal segment -- or excuse me, in the International segment where carriers are really trying to push empties back offshore. We're also starting to see a lot more domestic empty repositioning moves back to the West Coast. We think that's in anticipation of possible ILA action on the East Coast ports there. And then the second part of your question is when does it really -- when does the highway rates get better and when we start to see some of the capacity drop out from the highway carriers that are putting a lot of pressure on rates. I think we're around the bottom. I really do, from what I've seen, from what read and from what I hear from our customers, we're kind of bouncing right along the bottom. And I think we're getting closer and closer to an inflection point. Talking to one of our biggest customers today, they noted that they're expecting a real peak season this year for the first time in a few years. And I think that bodes well both for our international customers as well as for our domestic customers. Tom Wadewitz : So, it sounds like maybe stability in second half looked to 25% for maybe some growth in revenue per unit. Is that a reasonable way to think about it? Ed Elkins : Yes. I think RPU on the domestic side is moving sideways. Alan Shaw : Thanks, Tom Tom Wadewitz : Thank you. Operator : The next question will be coming from Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Scott? Scott Group : Hey. Thanks. Good afternoon. So Mark, maybe just some help on the cost side, $25 million we get from the wage increase in Q3, but obviously, there were some good sequential cost progress. So any way to just help us think about the overall ex fuel trend and OR in Q3? And then maybe just separately, the mix chart the last couple of quarters is really helpful. Do you think this is a -- is this a cyclical phenomenon of negative mix? Or is there something that's maybe more structural about where the growth is coming from? Mark George : Thanks, Scott, for the question. I'll ask Ed to help tag team on that second part of the question on the mix. But do you want to go first with that? Ed Elkins : Sure. I can do that. I've already talked about some of the mix challenges that we're seeing in intermodal. And I will tell you, we see the same story that's been playing out in the second quarter going forward into the really third and fourth. We're seeing significant volume growth in some of our lower-rated merchandise commodities like aggregates and finished vehicles, and both of those move at kind of the lower end of that RPU spectrum. We are focused a lot on earning back merchandise share and the additional volume that we are seeing is really attributable to the better velocity and car supply that we're seeing out there. I mean think about what happened in the automotive market where we actually use less equipment to handle a record amount of revenue. It's a real sea change from where we've been in... Alan Shaw : Yes, Ed you got something going on in intermodal. We're leveraging most powerful intermodal franchise in the East, we rationalized 15% of our lanes. John is providing the best service product we provide in years and volumes up 8%. Scott Group : And it gets right down to the basics, right? We sweat the asset efficiencies, moving the most miles per day that we can, driving the efficiencies of our locomotives and creating resiliency at a really low cost by eliminating waste, creating more capacity so we can onboard more customers and lengthen our trains and really drive out the service reliability through our war rooms and our drill down. Mark George : And that transitions into the first part of the question. We're going to see more incremental volume growth here in the third quarter. That's one of the tailwinds for sure. Even though we'll probably have some mix erode benefit from that adverse mix, I guess. But I'd say another tailwind is, as you touched on, Scott, we've got really good momentum here on the productivity side. So I expect we're going to see continued reductions in crew starts and over time despite higher volumes. I think fuel efficiency should continue to improve and look, we're attacking -- we're in the very, very early innings of attacking purchase services. So we've got some broad-based initiatives there. So we're going to see some really good tailwinds here, I think, in the third quarter. But as you touched upon, headwinds are there. We've got that 4.5% agreement wage increase that takes effect in July 1. So on day one of the third quarter, $25 million step-up in Comp and Ben comes from that, and that's 80 basis points of sequential OR headwind. And on top of that, fuels the way we're modeling it, it seems like fuel is going to be probably 50, 60 basis points of sequential OR headwind as well. So we'll see how it all shakes out here. But ultimately, we're really happy with our position going into the third quarter. Alan Shaw : Yes. Look, we're really confident in our guidance for an OR in the second half of the year is 64% to 65%, despite revenue headwinds. And it's because of this flywheel effect that we're seeing and productivity, where a faster network is generating a lot of opportunities for John and his team to unlock savings. Scott Group : Got it. Operator : The next question will be coming from Ken Hoexter from Bank of America. Ken, go ahead. Ken Hoexter : Hey great. Good afternoon. I know that was recorded, but that seemed like you were on super speed. It was pretty good. Just talking -- I guess, following on Scott's question there with the sequential performance, it seems like the five-year would suggest it doesn't move much in OR. But you're looking at 64%, 65% from a 65% or 65.9% if you exclude the real estate? And I get what you just ran over with, Scott. But it seems like given that the steps you're taking, Alan you kind of said you're really confident in those savings. Shouldn't we be taking, I guess, bigger steps down with some of the things you're doing. Maybe just talk then what is the upside downside to that that target, right? If you're confident in 64%, 65%, what do you need to happen on John's side to maybe get you a little bigger step-up versus the counter cost you have. Mark George : Well, look, Ken, again, you're right that sequentially, Q2 to Q3, when we look historically, you have some years where you have improvement in the OR. You have other years where you have some level of degradation. I think on average, it's probably slight degradation in this year, which is somewhat of a unique period of time. And this is if you exclude 2020. But in this year, if you look at this period of time, we're expecting sequential volume improvement. So that's really going to help us. And the gravy on top of that is continued momentum in what John is doing, in face of all the headwinds that I laid out. So that's where the confidence is coming from. I don't know John do you want to add? John Orr : I would say, Ken, my confidence comes from the power of the people and the engagement that we're delivering in the field. In the early days of my onboarding, I would go into major terminals and see opportunities, engage the team, inspire them to lead change, and now as we build the team and reframe how our management structure is in the field, really focused on the day-to-day as well as strategic intent, we're doing that to scale, more people seeing more things. We're creating the flywheel the finders and increased capability. Just today, I signed off on a service design that eliminates 42 starts a week. And that's the result of 4 or 5 people just being out in the field, doing safety Blitz is seeing other things happening and finding ways to improve safety, synthesize train starts elongate trains and create more capability in the field. This is the power of the flywheel. And we're doing it based on safety and service sustainability. And I'm very confident as we build people and structure. We're going to keep delivering. Mark George : So just getting also to the essence of your question on why not better, I'm just going to repeat what I said to Scott, there is some headwind here in the third quarter from the second quarter related to the wage increase of 80 basis points. And also the way we see the fuel curve playing out, there's probably another 60 basis points of headwind. So we're talking about overcoming that. And those are big hurdles. Maybe fuel is not -- doesn't end up being as bad. That could be some upside. But honestly, we got to see where volume shakes out too. Ken Hoexter : I think there's going to be a lot of hard work to overcome what we're doing meet our guidance, and it's going to be sweat equity all the way. Ed Elkins : Agree. And we're targeting more revenue. I mean we know the macro environment is challenged but look, let me give you 2 examples of recent wins that are only possible because of higher velocity and better car supply. We converted a coil line from the highway with our largest middle customer between Indiana and Ohio and that's in a challenged metals market. So we grew inorganically off the highway. We also converted the large highway lane to rail in the state of Georgia with our largest aggregate shipper, all because we're able to handle more tonnage with less equipment. Operator : The next question will be coming from Jeff Kauffman from Vertical Research Partners. Jeff, go ahead. Jeff Kauffman : Thank you very much and congratulations in a tough environment. I just kind of want to get your big-picture view on some of the changes with the STB and the hearings that they're having and how that may or may not impact the rail. Alan Shaw : The STB has got a hearing coming up about growth. And that's part of our balanced strategy. The STB is focused on service, so are we? And we're delivering, right? We are improving service, we're reducing costs, we're growing revenue and we're enhancing safety. So we've got a good story to tell here, and we're aligned. John Orr : And just to add, Alan, when we were in Washington a few weeks ago meeting with the STB commissioners, they were really reinforcing our business plan and resiliency as being an enabler of service and driving the US economy, and they were right in lockstep with our vision. So I think it will -- it's always going to challenge the sector when the commercial regulator wants to talk to the sector. But when we're leading front of all of that, I think it serves us well to continue what we're doing. Operator : The next question will come from Chris Wetherbee from Wells Fargo. Chris, go ahead. Chris Wetherbee : Thanks. Good afternoon guys. I guess as we're thinking about the progress that you're making John, in particular, as we move through in the back half of the year. I guess, how do we think about headcount? What resources are sort of required given the progress that you're making here? I guess, in other words, should we be able to see further reductions in heads as we move sequentially through the rest of the year? John Orr : Well, I can tell you this, while it's true, there are fewer T&E head counts, this is not a head count reduction exercise. This is rightsizing the service and aligning the asset efficiencies with the customer and the customer requirements. So sequentially, we did show a 2% improvement on T&E. We've frozen hiring except where there's a really substantial reason or an acute skill that we need to bring on. But it really is working with labor to address outliers, rightsize the organization and where we're long on people, getting the flexibility to move them where they need to be. And I really watch our expense and the cost for T&A -- or sorry, T&E head count in our KGTM. And I made that clear in my opening remarks that despite the fact that we're improving service providing some of the best operating efficiencies in the network, we're doing it at a lower cost overall. And that's what I really focus on eliminating the waste associated with overtime, taxis, hotels, those sorts of things that don't give you any value. So that's where I think you can look forward to seeing more of. Mark George : And Chris, I would tell you, we are on track to be down 2%, like we had guided previously by the time we get to the end of the year versus the end of last year. And that's on carrying a little bit more volume, right? Chris Wetherbee : Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Brian Ossenbeck from JPMorgan. Brian, go ahead. Brian Ossenbeck : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking questions. So Mark, just to maybe come back to the sequential headwind of about 140 basis points into 3Q from 2Q, certainly implied that it's more of a fourth quarter weighted impact to get to the target? Or are there some other sort of big ticket items you're counting on coming through the next quarter. And I guess to that point, Ed gave us a couple of examples, but volume environment has been tough to call. It's been a little softer than expected. So what gives you the confidence that some of that's going to come through sequentially to help you hit that target in 3Q? Mark George : Yes. I think that actually, the profile in the back half, you have a typical challenge in the fourth quarter being a lighter one where you see the OR float up. I actually think because of the momentum we're making there'll be continuous productivity that we get throughout the year. So, while we might get a little bit more volume in the third quarter and a little bit less as you typically would expect in the fourth quarter, the productivity is going to help us sail through. And I would I would imagine that both third and fourth quarter are going to look somewhat similar here. Operator : The next question will be coming from Jon Chappell of Evercore ISI. Jon, go ahead. John Chappell : Thank you. Good afternoon. Ed, past and future. First, in the past, is there any way to quantify, if there was any, any potential volume impact from the distraction, if you will, of the last several months, any customers who maybe had some negative muscle memory from cutting to bone and putting in contingency plans ahead of final certainty. And then the second part of it would be for the future. You mentioned some of the wins that you've had from these new service metrics that you're putting up. Do you feel that you have a long list customers who have been resistant to moving to the rail given past service who are now a little bit more open to switching back to the rail network given some of these vast improvements you've made? Ed Elkins : Yes. I'm trying to remember the first part of your question. Alan Shaw : I -- any volume. Ed Elkins : Yes. look, our customers -- I think you guys know this. Our customers were one of the most supportive groups of our strategy out there as we move through this whole first half of the year and they were rooting for us and they are and they are behind us, helping us unlock additional value for the supply chain right now. And moving forward, look, we had a lot of confidence in growing our volumes across the board. But really, we're focused on one area in particular where we know that we have lost share -- that's in our merchandise markets. And I would say it is not customers that are resistant to coming back to us is customers that we have to earn back because they had to find a different supply chain solution, which probably cost them more money. So we're working really hard every single day earn those customers back, and that's what we're focused on. Alan Shaw : Look, our service product sales in this market, right? The two most service-sensitive markets, Automotive and Intermodal grew 7% and 8% on respectively, because of the great product that John Orr and his team are putting together. And because of the alignment between marketing and operations, they're looking for every opportunity to secure additional revenue and additional margin we were able pick up spot opportunities in weak coal markets and weak agriculture markets because of the great product we're delivering and the capacity dividend that John has created. Ed Elkins : And the relationships that we've built over a long period of time with our customers, who like I said, supported this whole thing. Alan Shaw : Great point. Operator : The next question will be coming from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Brandon, go ahead. Brandon Oglenski : Hey, good afternoon. And thanks for taking my question. And maybe just on a very quick point of clarification. Are you still expecting coal yields to decline in the back half, especially on export because I think that was the prior expectation. And then, Mark, I think in your recorded remarks, you ended your statement talking about, hey, look, we had prior big land sale transactions. We think we've identified a few more. I think that's what I heard. So should we be contemplating that in the forward OR outlook? I think that's maybe where you were going. And you also made a comment that I think you should expect about $12.5 million a quarter. So should we be thinking annualized $50 million gains? Or are you saying there's potentially bigger sales coming. Thank you. Mark George : Ed, I'll answer that second part first. So the large land gains that I was referring to would be things that we would typically call out and referred to as kind of probably more on the non-GAAP side. And that's really in terms of trying to augment our balance sheet. So no, they are not in any way part of the path on the OR going forward. It was really more of a conversation on capital and restoring our balance sheet. Typically, we guide to $30 million to $40 million a year on real estate gains in the normal course that we absorb within the OR. And there are years where that's $20 million, there are years where that's $50 million, but it's kind of in that 30/40 range. So I was making a more general smoothing commentary talking about, call it, $50 million, but it could be in that neighborhood $40 million, $50 million range this year. Ed Elkins : Okay. And then you'd asked about coal price as well. There were a few global supply chain disruptions during the quarter caused the slight lift prices, but those gains have mostly eroded away. And the expectation is that rates are going to continue to drift slightly lower the experts that we talk to, and there are several of them are really expecting those seaborne prices to stay north of $200. But we'll see. We'll see what happens. Operator : The next question will come from Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley. Ravi, go ahead. Ravi Shanker : Thank you. Good evening, everyone. I think you said earlier that there was something around the East Coast port actions and some customer behavior there. Can you unpack that a little bit more and give us a little more detail there? What are you seeing already, what's some of the time line for this? And kind of where can it go before that settles down? Ed Elkins : Sure. I'll take that one. I think everyone knows the ILA has done a lot on September 30 to reach agreement with the port operators. We are talking to all of our steamship line customers as well as our domestic intermodal partners. And shippers are starting to hedge their bets a little bit. We see a lot of West Coast activity on the rise for a number of reasons. That includes what's going on in the Red Sea. But as that happens, customers, the BCOs have to get their freight to market. So they're deploying freight to the West Coast as well as the east. And I really believe, and this is just me observing the market. I think with the shortage of containers, seaborne containers that they are out there because of the elongated supply chains. What you're going to see is steamship lines will not want their boxes come in inland off the West Coast. And so there's going to be a lot of demand for domestic intermodal out the West Coast. That's the way I think this thing evolves. Operator : The next question will be coming from Elliot Alper for TD Cowen. Elliot, go ahead. Elliot Alper : Thank you. This is Elliot on for Jason Seidl. You brought up the next lever for margin will be some of the broad-based initiatives in purchased services. Hoping you could elaborate on that. You talked about some of the OpEx items that will be headwinds through the back half of the year. Maybe how should we think about the cadence of purchased services as we progress through the year? Mark George : Hey, thanks for the question, Elliot. Yes, I mean it's -- obviously, it's a big spend amount that's gone up a lot from technology in the past handful of years, largely subscription-based, cloud-based services. So you see a lot more software costs showing up now and purchase services as opposed to in capital. But at the same time, about -- probably about one-third is related to the volume variable costs associated with intermodal activity. So, Intermodal grew 8% year-over-year, but we actually limited the purchase services increase to around 3%. And actually, sequentially, it was down slightly. So this is an area that we've spent a lot of time, John and I in the past couple of months talking about and we're going to be focused pretty aggressively on trying to find opportunities to bring this down. And certainly, a lot of the other areas of purchased services outside of the volume variable pieces. John, do you want to jump in? John Orr : Yes. We look -- just take fuel, for example. We're really driving hard to pull locomotives out, reduce our exposure there. But at the same time, looking at our fuel distribution process. We've been able to streamline that, reduce some DTL trucks and reliance on that, similar to how we're pruning the intermodal franchise, we're pruning some of the more expensive fuel and fuel distribution and at the same time then looking at how do we create more vendor accountability and visibility. So we've got some really short-term, midterm and long-term views on fuel. And that even putting locomotives down cascades into our materials and the services associated with maintaining locomotives that we're able to put down. Mark George : Yes. And one other point on purchase services because you did ask about how it will look at the balance of the year. I would tell you, it is going to be no worse than what you see in the first half. I would expect it to be down year-over-year in the back half. Alan Shaw : We've got broad-based focus on productivity, right, purchase service is a big part of that. But we've got a clear line of sight on the road map, drive productivity and workforce and then fuel and purchase services and equipment rents. And at the same time, really focused on leveraging this great service product to drive more merchandise revenue and then leveraging our powerful intermodal franchise as the truck market response to drive more revenue there as well. Elliot Alper : What do you think about one of the biggest crew costs, recrews? Alan Shaw : And how much of that drives services and job you've done on reducing that over time. Elliot Alper : So we're not increase recrews out, reducing our exposure to -- over time reducing our exposure to taxi cabs, hotels, all the associated costs with that. And that is just a winning proposition because as you reduce recrews, creating service stability, that flies in the real house of Ed and being able to sell, that's the power of the resiliency that we're creating at the lowest cost possible and the flywheel of mobility. Operator : The next question will be coming from Daniel Imbro from Stephens Incorporated. Daniel go ahead. Daniel Imbro : Yes. Thanks. Good evening, guys. I wanted to circle back to winning some of that merchandise business back from the disruption earlier this year. It sounds like service is in a good place. The flywheel is turning and you have the ability to absorb that volume. So I guess, what do you think it takes to catalyze and start winning back some more of that more profitable merchandise volume? And then on the guide, does it include some pace of market share win back or volume win back that's embedded in that volume outlook for the back half? Thanks. Alan Shaw : Yes. A lot it is just leveraging that improved service product and also the capacity that we have to bear. As we increase the utilization of our equipment and our customers' equipment, we can put more capacity up against the market. Frankly, even in this freight environment, customers want to save money. And rail has a cost advantage relative to truck. Ed Elkins : Exactly. And look, let's be clear, the erosion in our merchandise volume didn't happen in the first half of this year. It's happened over a fairly extended period of time, right, as we've worked really hard to get to where we are right now. So, there are varying levers we're going to pull with various customers. But the first one that we're going to pull with every customer is giving them exactly what they want, which is a conveyor belt that runs at the same speed all the time, that's fundamentally what our customers need, first of all, and we're out there right now, demonstrating it and improving it to them. Alan Shaw : And I think that's why our approach customer service facing is better, and we're still getting productivity, reducing resources, reducing capacity -- creating capacity without impacting service. Operator : The next question will come from Jordan Alliger from Goldman Sachs. Jordan, go ahead. Jordan Alliger : Yes. Hi. Afternoon. Just sort of a question, sort of from an operational standpoint, a whole bunch of operational initiatives that you talked about to close the margin gap, I'm just sort of curious, as we think about all of them, how much of the plan this year and as we flow into next year is what you would consider for lack of a better word, basic blocking and tackling, fine-tuning versus major sea changes. Just trying to assess the difficulty of execution as we go along from here? Thanks. Ed Elkins : Well, there is no secret. I mean, it's hard work, and it's running an efficient, effective railroad every single day. And that stability lends itself to opportunity, whether it's in asset utilization, crew utilization, fuel efficiency, all of those things. I've made a solid commitment on the path to taking out -- overall our $450 million in the -- to make this happen. And I -- that's a series of small wins, bigger wins. But there -- we've got line of sight to a big pipeline of opportunities that we're just growing through and they'll come at different points. Today is what we would consider an inflection point. And as we move through that, create stability and drive forward, it will always be there. So I would say it's a blend of those things and we're going to drive hard. Alan Shaw : Look, it's leadership, it's plan, it's discipline of execution. And what John and his team are producing is the acceleration of our operational improvements allows us to have the confidence to reaffirm our guidance and overcome the market weakness for the second half of year. Operator : The next question will come from Walter Spracklin from RBC Capital Markets. Walter, go ahead. Walter Spracklin : Yes. Thanks very much, operator. Good afternoon everyone. I'd like to turn that market opportunity focus to one that hasn't been in your wheelhouse before and that's Mexico Union Pacific having mentioned it on their call several times, obviously, a big focus for CPKC near-shoring and onshoring being a big trend. I know when you gave access to CPKC gave emerging access to the CPKC, it may have been a little bit contingent at the time during the debate. But I think -- correct me if I'm wrong, I mean, what they're saying is that this now opens up a route or a new destination for Mexico product into the Southeast via CPKC and into your network and CSX's network and that the opportunity presented has never been there before. Do you -- is that true? Do you see that as an opportunity? Could this be a new source of business for you getting Mexico product into the Southeast via your roots as described? Or would you put more of a challenge on that? Ed Elkins : Well, look, here's what I would say. We know that near assuring or onshoring how everyone described that is occurring. There's two kinds of manufacturing that I think is going to come back to North America. Advanced manufacturing, which is high value add and probably is very automated. I think that's going to come back to the U.S. But basic manufacturing is probably going to a place in North America, that is Mexico. So we're talking really every week with Grupo Mexico as well as the CPKC on opportunities. One of those opportunities is connecting Mexico to the Southeast via the Meridian Speedway. That's for sure. There are other opportunities that will emerge in the near future that I think will be very exciting opportunities and products various segments of U.S. manufacturing. Walter Spracklin : Ed, we said General Motors in the office yesterday talking about some of the supply chains, and it wasn't lost on me that Mexico was part of that conversation. It's going to be a part of the conversation, and I've just spent the last three years that part of the world and really understand where the connection opportunities are. And you're right, we've got a great opportunity for both major railways in Mexico as well as the short sea. So I think that's a real opportunity in the immediate and near term? Ed Elkins : Yes, I would say standby for future developments. Operator : The last question from this call will come from Stephanie Moore from Jefferies. Stephanie, go ahead. Stephanie Moore : Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you. I wanted to touch on with just the increased productivity that you're seeing this year, does this kind of load the spring so to speak, going forward for even spring so to speak, going forward for even better OR improvements in the years ahead, 8-K kind of maintaining the guide this year, even the lower revenues. So, if we roll that forward to 2025 and 2026, hopefully, more constructive OR improvements in the, years ahead 8-K kind of maintaining the guide this year even the lower revenues. So if we roll that forward to 2025 and 2026, hopefully, more constructive freight background or a backdrop, does that mean kind of the freight background or a backdrop, does that mean kind of the accelerating OR expansion in the accelerating OR expansion in the years ahead? I'd years ahead? I'd love to get your thoughts. Thanks. Alan Shaw : Hi Stephanie, at the beginning of this year, we set out a pretty aggressive long-term OR targets. And we are doing everything we said we would do. And we are delivering despite a weak freight environment. We are in the first year of a multiyear plan to reduce OR to a sub-60 rate, and then we'll keep going. But Stephanie, at the beginning of this year, we set out a pretty aggressive long-term OR targets. And we are doing everything we said we would do. And we are delivering despite a weak freight environment. We are in the first year of a multiyear plan to reduce OR to a sub-60 rate, and then we'll keep going. But we're executing. We're improving service. We're reducing costs. We're growing revenue in a tough freight environment, and we're enhancing our safety. we're executing. We're improving service. We're reducing costs. We're growing revenue in a tough freight environment, and we're enhancing our safety. We've laid out a road map, and we're delivering on it. Mark George : And I think if you see outsized top line opportunities that on the horizon, I think you know in this industry, it usually generates outsized if you see outsized top line opportunities that -- on the horizon, I think you know in this industry, it usually generates outsized through opportunities and through opportunities and maybe end up getting there faster. So thank you very much everyone. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Alan Shaw, President and CEO for the final comments. Alan Shaw : Thanks for your interest in Norfolk Southern. And we look forward to continuing conversations over next couple of months.

Turning to Slide 3, it's now my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's President and Chief Executive Officer, Mark George. Mark George : Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Here with me today are John Orr, our Chief Operating Officer, Ed Elkins, our Chief Marketing Officer, and Jason Zampi, our recently appointed Chief Financial Officer. I've had the privilege of working closely with Jason during my five-year tenure at Norfolk Southern, and he brings incredible talent, experience, and leadership to our executive team. Over the last few weeks, it's been energizing to connect with labor leaders, regulators, customers, and my fellow railroaders across the Norfolk Southern network. We have a strong franchise with diversified markets, high-quality customers and partners, as well as skilled employees who are committed to successfully executing on our strategy and delivering for our shareholders, customers, colleagues, and communities. Speaking of colleagues and communities, I want to thank our amazing team of railroaders who planned for and responded valiantly to the devastation that Hurricane Helene caused across our network. It was their fast and effective actions that resulted in us being able to recover and serve our communities within days. There's a lot more work to do, but we've made enormous progress. It's the tremendous skill and dedication of our railroaders that have enabled us to deliver third-quarter results that are among the best in the company history. Together, we drove productivity, grew volumes, and delivered notable sequential and year-over-year margin improvement while overcoming a challenging landscape. We achieved 3% higher revenue compared to the prior year, and adjusted earnings per share was 23% higher than the third quarter last year. Importantly, we delivered 570 basis points of adjusted OR improvement, bringing that ratio down to 63.4%, continuing to close the margin gap with peers. You'll hear today from John about the incredible work of the operations team that is driving significant and sustainable improvements, as well as resilience in overcoming multiple weather challenges and an East Coast port disruption. Their commitment to excellence is helping us build a stronger, more efficient network. We also accelerated volumes in the quarter. Ed will provide greater detail on the components, the drivers, and outlook for our markets. And finally, Jason will provide color to a number of notable achievements in terms of productivity, as well as line sales and project rationalization. I'll turn it over now to John to start with an overview of our operational progress. John? John Orr : Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. In Q3, our team drove system-wide improvements that are demonstrating how our focus on safety is protecting our people and our organization, while serving as the foundation for sustainable service and productivity improvements. I am delighted to share our transformation agenda proof points. Our guiding value is safety. Overall, I'm very encouraged with our progress on safety. While our FRA personal injury rate has increased, serious injuries and total accidents have declined significantly, 40% and 20% respectively. Our blueprint for commitment starts with our people. They are value creators. Through our new Thoroughbred Academy, we are investing in the work environment and core railway skills. In the quarter, over 300 top-level operations leaders completed the first of a multi-year curriculum that builds organizational trust and drives business performance. And over the next three months, 2,300 frontline and operating officers will participate in safety curriculums. Turning to service, with safety as our guiding value. Service performance is our North Star. The team is designing out handlings and extending train schedules, which is producing gains in speed and consistency. Q3 car velocity was 13% higher year-over-year, driven by a 9% increase in train speed and progressive reductions in terminal dwell. The productivity improvements driving service are also allowing us to accelerate cost reduction and create a more competitive platform for growth. Our flywheel of cost takeout initiatives has been robust. Year-to-date, we've reduced over 130 crew starts per day, with an 8% reduction in cost per start, including a 20% reduction in overtime and the elimination of attendance and other unproductive incentives. On the intermodal front, the new intermodal reservation system is helping us develop a unique value proposition in the industry by adding terminal visibility, accountability, and rigor. Locomotive productivity in the quarter improved 18% year-over-year, allowing us to reduce our fleet and capital requirements for both rolling stock and engines. We've stored over 500 locomotives and have moved 8,000 plus cars offline since March. This has allowed us to challenge previous capital spending assumptions. Through our new precision energy management program, we've optimized HPT standards, extended train schedules, and are relaying more power from train to train, keeping assets in productive revenue service longer. As a result, fuel efficiencies are at record levels. Our strategy is both targeted and broad, tactical and strategic, ranging across structural improvements in consumption, procurement, materials management, purchase service optimization, crew cost efficiencies, and productive enhancements. And we've just scratched the surface in extolling a few of the initiatives that are within our pipeline that are helping us close the competitive gap and track confidently to our cost reduction commitments. As we move to the next slide, I want to take a moment to state how proud I am of our response to Hurricanes Helene and Milton, especially to our engineering teams. They proactively protected our employees, communities, and assets. Our recovery demonstrates the breadth and capability of our team. Responders cleared over 15,000 trees, managed over 1,000 locations with power outages, repaired multiple washouts and scour locations, and supported local responders, including two instances where they led life-saving civilian rescues. This resilience highlights our preparedness and ability to recover swiftly from natural disasters. None of this is possible without an inspired and committed team. We are enriching a strong culture by blending external talent with legacy leaders in a field first management team that is accelerating solutions and deepening ownership and accountability. Our new labor agreements enable us to innovate across our entire workforce. So, what you see is that we have established a new baseline and standards heading into Q4. These are providing next-level perspectives of our assets, their utilization, and the service quality they unlock. Working as a field-centric team, we are building a safer, more efficient, and more resilient operation. Success breeds success. Thank you, and I'll turn it to Ed. Ed Elkins : Well, thank you, John, and good morning to everyone on the call. I'll start on Slide 10 with a review of our commercial results for the third quarter, where you'll see that the work we're putting into creating a fluid network and dependable service delivered year-over-year revenue and volume growth. Overall revenue of $3.05 billion was 3% higher than the third quarter in the prior year, and volume moved up 7% year-over-year, with all three segments contributing gains for the quarter, while RPU fell 4% as our price gains were outpaced by lower fuel surcharge revenue, lower coal prices, and unfavorable impacts from intermodal mix. You've heard me discuss all these factors in previous quarters. The merchandise segment produced year-over-year volume growth led by our grain markets and segments of our chemicals business. NS was able to deliver this growth backed by a service product that our customers can count on every day, and you've heard me talk all year long about our focus on our merchandise business and the increased value to our customers is evident, as this marks the 37th out of the prior 38 quarters where merchandise RPU less fuel grew year-over-year. Now, Hurricane Helene impacted certain segments of our merchandise business in the southeast, but we expect volumes to gradually recover as our affected customers operations normalize over time. Intermodal revenue grew 4% year-over-year this quarter, as volume growth of 9% was offset by a 5% decline in RPU. Stagnant truck prices continue to pressure domestic intermodal rates, and unfavorable mix trends continue with strong gains in international and domestic, outpacing our premium market volumes in intermodal. The ILA strike negatively impacted our international volumes, but we expect the majority of this volume will be recovered in the months ahead. Finishing up here with coal, revenue declined 2% for the third quarter. Our year-over-year volumes finished up 11% with declining export prices, an unfavorable mix within the portfolio pushed down RPU by 11%. The coal business saw headwinds from easing export prices and challenged utility segment factors to include low natural gas prices, high stockpiles, and reduced demand in coal-burning regions. Turning to the next slide, let's talk through our outlook for the remainder of the year. Overall, we expect our markets to experience tempered growth, albeit with some discrete headwinds from market trajectory and mixed impacts on certain sectors. It's very important to note that the impact of fuel price normalization from the 2022 historic highs will remain the single largest revenue headwind that we face, and this has been true all year long. We expect our merchandise business to see continued but sedate growth supported by easing interest rates and ongoing infrastructure projects, although sector-specific headwinds in various sectors in our automotive and metals markets will pose challenges. Intermodal will see strong demand driven by our dependable service product, by new bid awards, and import-export demand despite the interruptions caused by the ILA strike that ended on October 3. We're prepared to handle international shipments that were delayed during that interruption. Our outlook for coal is really a mixed bag, as seaborne pricing for met coal is trending downward. On the other hand, we're seeing positive momentum in the thermal export markets. And finally, in the wake of the destruction caused by Hurricane Helene, we stand ready to support our customers and handle the goods and products needed to help the affected regions rebuild. And as always, I will end with a word of thanks to our customers for their partnership and their support. With that, I'll welcome Jason Zampi to the call to talk about our financial results. Thank you. Jason Zampi : Thanks, Ed. I'll start with a reconciliation of our gap results on Slide 13, and I wanted to call out three items here in the quarter. First, the impacts from the Eastern Ohio incident are itemized as they have been for the last several quarters. I highlight that our insurance recoveries outpaced the incremental costs of the incident for the second quarter in a row. That brings the total cumulative amount of insurance recoveries to over $650 million. The other two items are the result of specific actions we executed to further our strategic objectives, including an unrelenting focus on productivity and asset utilization. As we previewed last quarter, we completed two significant line sales, an example of us continuing to simplify the network and generate cash flows. These two sales resulted in $380 million of gains and generated almost $400 million of cash. Additionally, under the leadership of our new CIO, Anil Bhatt, who has a relentless focus on technology delivery and ROI generation, we rationalized certain IT projects that were not generating the desired benefits. That, coupled with the discontinuance of our Triple Crown Road Railer assets, combined a total of $60 million in restructuring costs. Adjusting for these items, OR for the quarter was $63.4 and EPS totaled $3.25. That's a 650 basis point improvement in our adjusted OR since the first quarter, all while providing a safe, reliable, resilient service product, generating productivity, and growing the business. Looking at these adjusted results compared to last year and last quarter on Slide 14, you'll note that the year-over-year revenue was up $80 million due to strong volume growth, partially offset by RPU pressures. Operating expenses were down $118 million due primarily to fuel prices and productivity. All combined, these drove 570 basis points of OR improvement. From a sequential perspective, revenue is relatively flat. However, we have continued to build off the strong momentum from our productivity and cost reduction initiatives with expenses down $47 million and a 170 basis point improvement in OR. Drilling into these sequential variances starting with revenue on Slide 15. You'll note that the strength in coal and intermodal volumes drove an overall 3% volume increase over last quarter. Unfavorable mix, pricing pressures, particularly within the export coal market and lower fuel surcharge revenues drove RPU lower, leading to overall revenue that was essentially flat with the second quarter. Slide 16 breaks down the $47 million sequential improvement in expenses. The transformative actions delivered by John and his team are benefiting our P&L. And you'll see that through record fuel efficiency, strong labor productivity with T&E count down 3% on 3% more volume and decreases in rents due to better network fluidity. While the results of our initiatives to drive down purchase services are also taking hold, all more than offsetting the wage inflation headwind that we called out last quarter. These strong third quarter results and our operational momentum position us well to achieve our second half and full year targets. We do expect a sequential uptick in OR as we move into the fourth quarter from normal seasonality, including headwinds that we are expecting on the top line, but also due to additional cleanup costs from Hurricane Helene's aftermath. Going forward, we are confident in our ability to continue to improve margins that will generate shareholder value. And the $400 million in cash generated from the line sales along with our goal of reducing CapEx as we move into 2025 will help with much needed balance sheet repair. Mark, I'll hand it back to you. Mark George : Thanks, Jason. We are proud of our results in the quarter. Let me summarize some of what you just heard. First, we drove improvements in safety in the quarter despite volume increases and the significant weather events. Second, we leveraged attrition in the quarter while handling robust volume growth resulting in productivity gains while not compromising service. Third, we delivered strong operational resiliency recovering service quickly following numerous disruptive weather events with Helene being the most severe. Fourth, we executed upon major line sales that we signaled last quarter providing meaningful cash proceeds that will help us accelerate balance sheet repair. Finally, we delivered strong financial results in the third quarter, even with the volume pressures in the last eight days of September and we are on track for our second half and full year OR commitments, even if the full year revenue falls a little short of our guidance, which is to be up roughly 1%. So with that, let's open it up to questions. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Chris Wetherbee from Wells Fargo, please go ahead. Chris Wetherbee : Yeah, thanks, good morning. Maybe we could start with the sort of the short term where you left off. Just wanted to get a sense of maybe how you think about the progress that you've made and how you can carry that into the fourth quarter? I know you talked about the second half guide specifically around the operating ratio. I want to give them maybe a little bit -- drill down a little bit deeper on maybe how that impacts in the fourth quarter. Mark George : Thanks, Chris. This is Mark. Yeah, we've got really great momentum right now on the cost side. John can talk about that in a second. I think right now, we feel really good about those things that we can control. Yeah, as we talked about in Laguna, we were getting a little bit concerned about the auto and steel markets and that's starting to really play out the way we previewed. So that's definitely going to be something we keep our eye on. But generally speaking, intermodal is we expect to peak season. Intermodal should be good. Obviously, the port disruptions we don't know exactly when and how the volumes will manifest here in the fourth quarter. But generally, we feel really, really good about the way we go in the fourth quarter. John, why don't you talk a little bit about the momentum we've got on the cost side and then add a little bit more on the revenue. John Orr : Yeah. Chris, great question. And I would say, I'm really pleased the way we exited Q3 on safety. We finished Q3 at 2.05 and we're into the quarter at $1.5 million. And as you know, in a precision railway environment when things are working in the rhythm they're supposed to. And first and foremost, from a safety perspective, you get a lot of momentum. And we're seeing that in the terminals. And our terminal dwell is continuing to improve. And that's being achieved not only through the terminal itself, but how we're looking at reduction in handlings and accelerating cars through terminals by extending schedules of trains. So the work complexity is coming down while the capability is increasing. And that's playing out in fuel, that's playing out in a lot of purchase and services that taxi reductions, et cetera. And now we're able to negotiate and structurally change some of our vendor agreements that put more discipline around those things as a result of how we're improving. So I would say those are some of the cost and then the puts are also as we use our resources better we're able to create more opportunities for Ed to sell into spot markets and increase even our permits. So Ed, any color on that? Ed Elkins : Sure. Yeah. In the fourth quarter, we certainly expect to see continued growth in the intermodal product, both on the international side, but also on the domestic side. We see strong demand out there, and we've confirmed that with some of our key partners that we talk to every single day that they're seeing the same thing. So we're looking for a robust fourth quarter. From intermodal, the only headwind there is going to be premium and those are pretty well-known headwinds in terms of the challenges that, that particular market is facing. On the coal side, we see a lot of demand on export thermal. But let's be clear, seaborne prices for met are continuing to be a drag. And there's a lot of stockpile build on the domestic side. So there'll be some headwinds, some puts and takes. Mark's already talked about -- or excuse me, automotive and steel. We're keeping an eye on those. But we feel very good about our ability to capture every single opportunity that we're able to get in front of. Chris Wetherbee : Thank you. Do you think that gets you into the 64%, 65% range for the fourth quarter, though, when you think about the operating ratio? Mark George : Jason? Jason Zampi : Yeah. So we really had a great quarter. We're confident in meeting the 64% to 65% operating guidance for the second half of the year that we talked about earlier. As we move into the fourth quarter, we are expecting a sequential uptick in the OR and just a couple of things to remember. First, we called out the fuel recoveries this quarter. We don't expect that to recur in the fourth to that same magnitude. But that's -- those recovery is really a great outcome of running a tight railroad in the disciplined processes that John has put into place. So that's a great outcome there. Second, I'd say we're expecting a more normal seasonality. Historically, that's been around 100 basis points of headwind as you move from third to fourth quarter, and a lot of that is due to the revenue headwinds that Ed talked about. I'd also call out, we're able to close on about $20 million of land sales in both the second and third quarters. And as we've talked about, those are difficult to predict. So that could provide some sequential headwind. And then finally, as we called out, we're also going to have to deal with the additional costs from some hurricane cleanup. So that -- just on the expense side, that's around $20 million. But offsetting all that, just on the good side, we've got a lot of operational momentum and really doing a great job here on the productivity front. So that's what gives us confidence to reaffirm that second half guidance. Chris Wetherbee : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Ossenbeck, JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Brian Ossenbeck : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So maybe for Mark and Jason, can you just talk about the capital intensity of the business going forward? If locomotives off-line cars going offline at an increasing rate as well into storage? How do you see that going forward, you're rationalize with some other IT projects as well? So are you able to see a little bit lower capital intensity over the next couple of years? And how does that tie into your expectation to be back in the market buying back shares? Thank you. Mark George : Yeah. Great question, Brian. You really nailed the strategy here. I think with John taking more than 500 locomotives off-line, that allows us to really start to deploy capital elsewhere and actually constrain our capital to a large degree. And we brought in a nil to run the IT organization. And we've been reprioritizing and really reevaluating all the projects we have in the pipeline. And we're going to focus on a more concentrated portfolio of projects that are going to yield high returns, the fastest possible projects that we can work on to generate high returns. So we fully expect that CapEx next year will come down. And obviously, with the line sales we have this year and the cash buildup that we expect to have toward the end of the year, we fully expect to be back in the market repurchasing shares to some modest level next year. Thanks for the question. Jason Zampi : Yeah, Mark, if I could just add. As far as locomotives are concerned, we're looking at pushing back as far as we can our capital commitments to locomotives. And you're right, converting that resilience railroading and the disciplined approach to resources allows us to redo all of those things and really look for capital investments that create value either in a niche area like our B3 for the warrior coal that we've got or other things that Ed might bring online and help us really achieve a faster, more precise service delivery against new business call. But we're taking a really hard look at the IT projects that we've got working closely with Anil, Meena and her team looking at the resource consumption are really driving that ability. So it's just -- it's most -- it's both OpEx and capital that we're attacking here. Mark George : Thank you, Brian, next question? Operator : Your next question comes from Ken Hoexter, Bank of America. Please go ahead. Ken Hoexter : Hey, great. Good morning. And Mark and Jason, congrats on the new jobs. I guess -- thanks guys. So Ed, volumes are starting off, it looks like down about 1.5% in carloads. I think you said you can rebound. Are you talking about getting to positive growth? Is there a level you would think we should throw out there in terms of catching up? And then in terms of pricing with coal benchmark pricing down and I guess looking at where we are today at just over 200 , could we see or would you expect pricing to be down double digits or not quite that level again? Ed Elkins : Hi, Ken. I'll start with the last question first. I think we're going to see coal prices continue to drift lower. I don't think double digit, but we'll see. We're taking a very conservative approach to it here. And then on the question of overall volumes in the fourth quarter, we've seen a really nice catch up after the disruption from the port strike and from Helene and the areas that have recovered already. And we feel very confident. And I think this is one thing that it's hard to get across on a call, but we feel very confident in our ability to recapture volume no matter where it comes from, whether it's continued West Coast imports or more East Coast flowing through in the wake of the strike. So you put that together with what I would call some opportunistic spot moves that we've been able to pick up in the third quarter that may continue in the fourth. On the merchandise side, what the Norfolk is really doing right now, and John and his team are working really closely with us is we're really manufacturing a lot of capacity that we can deploy to be very agile. So you think about the rapid increase run-up in West Coast imports before the strike. And now we're much more fluid on the East Coast coming through. So I fully expect that whatever the market presents, we're going to be able to handle. Mark George : Thank you, next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Scott Group, Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Scott Group : Hey, thanks. Good morning. So John, some strong labor productivity with volume up 7%, headcount down 3 what's the runway here? Is this an incremental opportunity as we look out to next year? Or at some point, does this get tougher? John Orr : Well, Scott, I'm glad you recognize the work that our -- all of our team is doing, including our craft labor. They are really embracing our management and leadership style. And that's reflected in some of the CBAs there that we've got TAs against. I would say that labor productivity, we're just getting started on having a disciplined approach to our operations where we're looking at not just the head count, but how we -- how people are deployed and our train structures designing out handlings, designing out train stops and the elongating schedules allows us to increase the productivity of not only our people but also the resources like locomotives. And so I think these gains they're starting to really get traction and they'll continue to get traction. I really think that you can't underestimate the power of leadership and the power of the team. And you see our engagement with labor as being very collaborative and they're a major stakeholder in our PSR 2.0 application. Last month, we had over 65 labor leaders, including presidents of national governing bodies coming to Atlanta and talking about issues and really understanding what we're doing and embracing our philosophy on railroading. And look, they had some really challenging questions. They had some different points of view. But we were able to work through those things and come out with a really cohesive perspective on what we need to go forward. So I would say that I don't want to put the burden on any particular group shoulders to bear. I think as a team, we're bearing a lot of discipline of change and the commitment to change and that's reflected in the women and men who work for us. And as I've said, railroading is a tough business. It's a 365, 24/7. And when we're creating the environment where people feel that they're contributing and they feel fulfilled and what they do and who could be more fulfilled than contributing to the U.S. economy the way we do. So I think the story is just starting to be written. Mark George : Thanks a lot. Next question? Operator : Next question comes from Tom Wadewitz, UBS. Tom Wadewitz : Jason, I also wanted to say congratulations on the new roles. And John, really looks like you're having a great effect on the railroad. So congratulations on that as well. I wanted to see if I could ask you a bit about 2025. I know that's kind of probably tough given lack of visibility in markets and everything and pricing. But how do you think about the frame for '25 if you don't see improvement in some of the markets, right? It seems like industrial markets aren't getting better, maybe getting a little worse and you highlight automotive and metals. So is there enough productivity that you improve the margin in 2025? So obviously, high level -- is that reasonable, given John's commentary and momentum? Or if you don't see volume growth and some pickup in markets, is that kind of tough to do. Just wanted to see if you could offer any kind of high-level thoughts on how that -- those two kind of markets versus idiosyncratic network improvement, how to think about those two together? Thank you. Mark George : Hey, thank you, Tom. Great question. Let's bifurcate and just say that for the things we can control, which is cost. We've got a path. You will recall that we had committed to $250 million of cost reduction this year. We are on track to hit that number. We committed to another $150 million next year. So regardless of the economic environment, we committed to another $150 million next year in 2025. We're going to beat that. And John and I have spent a lot of time talking about this. I think there's a real opportunity to fast forward some cost reduction from 2026 into 2025. So we feel really, really confident there. We can't control the top line and the economic environment, except to say that there is share recapture opportunity out there. So even if you have a softer market, we still have some idiosyncratic opportunities to recapture some share to help mitigate any pressure that might be there. So obviously, there's a limit to how much you can get in any given year. But given the product that John and his team are putting out there for service, we feel really, really good about the traction and momentum we have with our customer base. John, do you want to talk any more about the confidence in our cost reduction next year? John Orr : I would say the confidence for me comes in the power of the team. And I look to my own experience through Hunter Camp back in the early 2000s and how Hunter encourage us to find the small wins and 1,000 small wins by an army of people who are believing in continuous improvement add up to a lot. And as we work through our investment in people and the almost 2,800 engagements that we're doing through the balance of the year, we're educating people on the specifics of PSR 2.01, how to really contribute to it. We're promoting the culture of change and really removing the mud as Hunter would say. And we're providing people the ability then to apply what we're teaching them on their jobs day to day. And that's really finding organic improvements. And then we've got our strategy where we're unlocking the value of the network. And that's the beauty of starting with two terminals like Chattanooga and Conway and really understanding how they work. And now we're able to force multiply those learnings and engage real asset utility. And now we're thinking -- rethinking how we use our assets. And we see that in some of our pool distributions and our asset management and the refinements. A great example is how we're moving the cars out of Detroit instead of stopping them in Toledo, and moving them over to Bellevue and then going to Elkhart we're able to repurpose a secondary yard and go right from Detroit right to Elkhart, removing assignments, removing car days, reducing our power locomotive fleet requirements. And those ideas are coming from the field up. And so it's really taking hold -- is a long answer to say the story is just unfolding here. And as we invest in people, as we engage in clearing out the organizational mud and the case for change is still there. There's a lot to be fixed here. And I think we're reflecting -- Mark George : Tom, when we put those targets out, they were targets. Now we're filling in that outline with real specific actions, and we're realizing that we were maybe a little modest in the targets that we saw in front of us because the actions now tallied a little bit more as we're putting together our 2025 number. So it feels good. Now Ed, do you have any thoughts on '25 outlook? Ed Elkins : Absolutely. And we're still working on what '25 looks like there's clearly a lot of lot of moving parts out there. But let's be clear about this. We're not sitting on our hands. We're not just waiting around to see what's going to happen. My team as well as John's are working together right now to build a service product that does one thing and that's produced service that you can count on delivered by people that you can trust every single day. And on top of that, we're working to build what I would consider to be a unique value proposition because of the technology that we're deploying at the customer level to make it very easy to do business with. That's a process change as well as some technology augmentation, but I think it's going to be a real differentiator in 2025. We look forward to the response from our customers on both counts. Mark George : Thanks, Tom. Next question? Operator : Next question comes from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Please go ahead. Brandon Oglenski : Hey good morning. And thanks for taking the question. So Mark, congrats on the top seat here. But I guess a two-part question for me. First, structurally at Norfolk, is there any way you're looking at this organizationally that you'd like to see different at the company? And then maybe following up from that discussion on 2025 OR, there was a lot of back and forth on guidance earlier this year with the proxy contest. So I think you guys had committed to 100 to 150 basis points of annual improvement for the next few years, but then also said maybe a sub-60 and three to four years of volume contributed. Is that still the right framework, especially within the context of the answer to that last question? Mark George : Yeah. I think starting with your second one, absolutely. We're still on track for that. And you remember the components, there were components of cost reduction there. And the 1 to 150 million was really based on kind of a more modest top line outlook of a middling 2% to 3% type of top line growth. But then if we had a more traditional top line recovery, that would get us to the sub-60% in by the three to four-year time window. So we stand by those guidance indicators. Now with regard to structurally anything different. I think what I would tell you is we are on track. We've got some great momentum. The strategy at its core is exactly what we're going to stick to. And this really gets to about execution right now. And we have a really sound operating team that is executing upon the strategy to create network fluidity that will allow for a really great service product. And as we always said, with that great service product, it will enable growth. You started to see that play out last quarter and now again this quarter. We've got some idiosyncratic opportunities to grow, and Ed and his team have been capturing on it. So that worked, and we told you that productivity is kind of the third leg of that strategy. And honestly, you also saw that play out in the third quarter. We had fallen out of balance with the strategy on productivity. We told you we were going to get back in balance, and we're well on our way to doing that with 570 basis points of OR improvement, thanks to a sprinkling of some volume here in this quarter, it was a real accelerant. But even the sequential improvement is very encouraging. So execution is what's key. And John and I talk about that a lot. And I kind of touched on it a little bit at Laguna I really embrace an operational excellence mindset coming from my background in industrial products. And I believe strongly that any good operation needs a quality type system, you can call it Six Sigma, you can call it ACE like we used to call it a mile company, which is achieving competitive excellence. Either way, you've got to have really solid standard processes that are based on best practices. You've got to get those systematized so that everybody follows it. And when you have breakdowns in the process, you do relentless root cause analysis to identify where the problems are and then fix the standard processes so you can mistake proof going forward. That's this virtuous cycle that we have to get ourselves into. And the beauty is, when an operator like John and John's team, what you hear about -- there's a real resemblance to what I'm describing. In fact, when John talks about the war rooms, what do you think the war rooms are? Those are relentless root cause analysis. Every time they have an issue, the war room gets to work on it. They figure out what the root cause is, they fix it. So we are in lockstep on driving that culture. And I'm really, really excited about that. And then I think the other thing is, obviously, culturally, I want to continue to advance first, our safety culture, but also a real two-way communication. John touched upon that a couple of minutes ago as well. But a two-way communication where information flows up, not just down. A lot of the best ideas that come inside this railroad are from the people who are on the ground, whether that's in the marketing organization, with what's happening with our customer base, whether that's in the operations team like John just described. We have to create that environment where people are comfortable to speak of. And it's not just process stuff. It's not just ideas for improvement, but it's also concerns that they might have. So we're going to be really working on creating and fostering a better culture for two-way communication. And then I would say, finally, Ed and I have been having a lot of conversations about really working a lot closer with our customer base to figure out exactly how we can serve them better to accelerate the share gains and the share recapture opportunities that are out there. So that's where I'd say the focus will be structurally going forward. And thanks a lot for the question, Brandon. Appreciate it. Next? Operator : The next question is from Jonathan Chappell, Evercore. Please go ahead. Jonathan Chappell : Thank you. Ed, on your market outlook, there's a lot more red and yellow than there is green. And you've talked about some of the headwinds there and maybe some more incremental -- you've also mentioned in some of these prior answers, spot market wins. So can you just maybe put a little bit more quantitative where you're winning, how much that is? If we look at a macro that's to industrial production growth. What's the realistic volume growth on the Norfolk Southern network as you're winning more than maybe the economy is giving you? Kathleen Quirk Yeah. I would point -- it's pretty easy. I would point to our ag markets. We're -- in the third quarter, we were able to take advantage of some market dislocations as well as some, what I would call, true spot opportunities that frankly, in prior quarters, we could never have addressed because we couldn't generate the additional capacity to do that nor the operational agility to really respond in a way that the market take advantage of. But this last quarter, we have, I would say, very successfully executed a number of those moves, whether it's soybeans, whether it's corn, whether it's grain, that have helped offset some of the weakness that we've seen in some of the other industrial markets, where we're fulfilling all the capacity needs that our customers have, but they simply don't have that much need right now. And I would point toward the deceleration in some of our auto markets. And there's some idiosyncratic phenomenon going on there with regard to whether it's quality holds or specific plant outages. But you think about intermodal and look at the very solid growth, both on the domestic and international side and the ability that our network has had to not only absorb that growth but also produce those spot wins that I'm talking about here, which really are, again, opportunities that we would not have been able to take advantage of in prior quarters. I would attribute part of our ongoing agility improvement to our reservation system on the intermodal side. And we're in the early innings of that, but I really think that over time, and John may want to comment on it. But over time, the feedback we're getting from our customers is it's going to help them know that they've got a ride on a train on a specific day, which allows them to plan and their customers plan and allows us to make some very important operational decisions that help us be not only more efficient but more reliable for our customers. Jason Zampi : Yeah. And I would agree. And while it's early days in the reservation system, I'm really confident that as we work through this, our customers are going to enjoy the discipline that brings to our terminals. Because they've been a part of its development. And what I'm excited about is the opportunity to add 100, 200, 300, 500, 1,000 feet to our intermodal trains or existing trains as we create the discipline smoothing out our network through the rest of the year and into next year. And then being able to really project what our true capacity is as far as that growth because I think we're just on the cusp of really hitting our stroke on long trains and bringing on new business at very low incremental costs. Mark George : Thanks, John. Next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Kauffman, Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Jeff Kauffman : Good morning, everybody. And thank you for squeezing me in. Congratulations also to Mark and Jason. I just want to go a different direction. I know there's some things you probably can't talk about with the labor agreements. But John, can you talk about what is going to make a difference for what you're trying to achieve in these labor agreements that were reached fairly run out for ratification, so you may not want to discuss some things. But just kind of talk about what's important for you to hit your targets with these new labor deals? Jason Zampi : Yeah, thank you for that question. And it is a really good question. And coming from both the craft and from organized labor in the early days of my career, I really appreciate having clarity on the future as far as the payment structures and the discipline around what my CBA looks like. So I think first, that extending that confidence to our workforce and predictability and how they can budget their own households and their own work schedules is really important. And that cascades then into our being able to model from the pricing and from the predictability with our customers. And third, I think it's very complementary to what we're trying to achieve in PSR 2.0. And that's a really disciplined service safety and really delivering value for our customers. And that discretionary effort that we're getting from our rent trade crews and our operating employees is really allowing us to optimize the value of our network, build a team, a team that's inclusive of every one of the 20,000 people who work here and contribute to the value that we're creating. And that leadership and developing skills and capabilities is just going to help us to enhance a great product already. And I think as well, then that allows us to really create a new blueprint and unlock the bigger rocks, that we need to, so that we move the network further along. So it's a win-win. And I know from my experience, there's nothing you can put a price tag on that discretionary effort. Mark George : Thanks a lot, Jeff. Next question? Operator : Your next question is from Jordan Alliger, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jordan Alliger : Yeah, good morning. I just want to talk about network resiliency, if I could. You had some pretty strong volumes in the third quarter. So I'm just sort of curious what's working well on resiliency, what still needs to improve really just to get a sense what needs to be done to ensure the network can run fluidly for the foreseeable future, so you could do the things you're talking about like taking share off the highway, et cetera. Thank you. Jason Zampi : Well, I would say, again, I would get back to we're trying to do things better in every area of the business. And in order to do that, we have to bring up our efforts and our capabilities to a completely another level. But I would say the six things that we focus on, the network health our asset efficiencies and our customer-facing metrics are the guiding metrics that we're going to use to drive that. And as we continue to improve those things under the hood, there are going to be a lot of ability to put more discipline, engineer out inefficiencies and engineer in optimization, things like the reservation system that are just going to unlock so much discipline around our terminals and intermodal as our growth and to have better discipline around that just gives us such an advantage as the market comes roaring back in the U.S. economy and as trucks tighten up, we'll be able to really leverage from a pricing perspective. And I think Ed's talked about that numerous times. Mark George : Jordan, I think what John has done decongesting the terminals and networks, it goes a long way to improving resiliency. I mean laying down 500 locomotives over 8,000 cars since Q1. And you create a lot more fluidity in the network. And when you add little bumps in the road, you have less congestion to hold you back from recovery. So that, I think, key and critical. And you saw it play out here in the third quarter following these storms. I would tell you a year ago, some of the events that we saw in the quarter probably would have set us back three months, okay? But we were back within a week and now we're actually at record network speeds and load wells. So it's really remarkable. And I do actually just want to refute the notion that resiliency is about retaining costs. In fact, we've achieved resiliency this quarter while lowering costs. So it's a good news story. We seem to have a good model in place here. Thanks for the question, Jordan. Next? Operator : Your next question comes from Ravi Shanker, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Ravi Shanker : Thanks, good morning, everyone. Thanks for the color on \u201825 on the productivity actions. But with that to drop through to the bottom line, how much pricing do you need to counter general inflation for next year? Ed Elkins : Thank you, Ravi, by the way. We've had a very successful year so far in terms of being able to price to the value of our service and that value is increasing as the year goes on. And we're very confident that we're going to finish up the year in a strong position. Going in \u201925 we continue to believe that we're going to outpace inflation in all of our major markets. Now commodity prices like seaborne coal probably be a headwind. We'll see how that evolves in '25. But when you think about our core product and the value of the service that we're offering, it's increasing and our customers are saving money at the same time. So it's a powerful combination. Mark George : You have to think of it, Ravi, in the elements when you talk about pricing, you can't talk about it as one topic, right? Merchandise, as I just said, we feel really good, really strong service helps as a good backdrop there as those inflation. So the model is intact. I think intermodal is going to be somewhat dependent on what happens with spot truck pricing. Clearly, we seem to have found the bottom. The question is when does it start coming off the floor here? And yeah, we have other commodity groups that follow indices that we don't control, obviously, in seaborne met being a big one. So -- but I think for those areas, like particularly merchandise in 2025, models intact. We feel really good. Thank you. Appreciate the question. Let's try to get another couple in. Operator : Your next question comes from David Vernon, Bernstein. Please go ahead. David Vernon : Good morning, guys. And congrats to the new roles. So maybe just kind of building off that question around the seaborne met market in 2025. Ed, you've been around this business a long time. What do you think about the U.S.'s role in terms of the export markets if we see a lower price correction? Are you worried just -- could you kind of maybe shape the price headwind that might manifest on a slightly weaker market for Norfolk into next year? And then kind of help us understand whether you're worried about also sort of like overall aggregate volume demand on the export markets for 2025? Ed Elkins : I'm a little bit readier than to get a lot into '25 because we're still building our view of that particular dimension. But I will tell you -- the U.S. has remained remarkably competitive over time. I think we're going to continue to do that, particularly when I think about export thermals, we're in a very good spot in terms of demand. I expect that to generally continue. And China is going to determine a lot about what happens with export met demand. There's a tremendous amount of geopolitical uncertainty that's driving a lot of commodity prices, driving a lot of energy prices. But we've got our weather eye on it, and we are fully prepared and capable of delivering the tonnage of our customers around the globe on need. David Vernon : Thank you. Mark George : Next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from Ben Nolan, Stifel. Ben Nolan : I appreciate you guys. I was just going to ask, you talked a little bit on the intermodal side that it feels like maybe it's bottoming. And specifically around -- and appreciating that the trucking market is still really challenged. Are you starting to see any green shoots on the premium intermodal at all? Or is that not yet the place where we are? Ed Elkins : On the premium side, there's still a lot of headwinds out there emanating from the highway generally. We are seeing -- I mean, you got to look at it from a fairly substantial distance, but we are seeing truck utilization head up. And I think we're close to the 10-year average now, and I think we're going to trend above it. You look at the total number of motor carriers that are out there, it's declining slowly. But both those things, along with feedback that we're getting from our key partners like J.B. Hunt and Hub Group are telling us that we're reaching a point where I fully expect that pricing is going to eventually inflect. I do think we're around the bottom now, and I have Phil at least somewhat confident knocking on the table here that that's true. Premium is a different story. We'll see how that evolves. What we are focused on is making sure that we're delivering exactly the product that, that particular segment needs. Ben Nolan : Okay, thank you. Mark George : That brings us to the end. Look, I want to thank everyone for your questions, and we look forward to talking to you all throughout the quarter. Have a great day. Thank you.",

Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. This call is being recorded on Wednesday, January 29, 2025. I would now like to turn the conference over to Luke Nichols, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Luke Nichols : Good morning, everyone. Please note that during today's call, we'll make certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to future events or future performance of Norfolk Southern Corporation, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and may differ materially from actual results. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full disclosure of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. Our presentation slides are available at norfolksouthern.com in the investor section, along with our reconciliation of any non-GAAP measures used today to the comparable GAAP measures, including adjusted or non-GAAP operating ratio. Please note that all references to our prospective operating ratio during today's call are being provided on an adjusted basis. Turning to Slide 3, it's now my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's President and Chief Executive Officer, Mark George. Mark R. George: Good morning and thank you, everyone for joining today. I'm joined here by John Orr, our Chief Operating Officer; Ed Elkins, our Chief Marketing Officer; and Jason Zampi, our Chief Financial Officer. Following our strong Q3 performance, we are very pleased to close out 2024 with another quarter of solid results, which further narrowed the margin gap to peers. Our strong operations enabled us to move 3% more volume in the quarter, yielding a 2% increase in revenue X fuel. We continue to deliver in our commitments, while building momentum to position Norfolk Southern for sustainable growth. Our network is running fast, our terminals are efficient, service metrics are as strong as they have ever been. Our customers are noticing and rewarding us with more business, and we continue to exercise strong cost discipline. When you put it all together, we delivered a Q4 that was in line with the guidance we gave, wrapping up a year where we delivered or exceeded on all the commitments we made. We removed nearly $300 million of costs, $50 million more than the $250 million we committed to in the spring. Our adjusted operating ratio ended at a 65.8 surpassing the guide we laid out of improvement between 100 to 150, and our second half OR was 64.1 at the favorable end of the range we outlined. The organization worked hard to deliver these results. I am proud and grateful to all the employees in Norfolk Southern. It's not just the financial results that are worth celebrating, our safety metrics improved dramatically throughout the year. Our employees are embracing safety as a guiding value, protecting one another, as well as the communities we serve. Our employees are driving positive change and propelling the company forward. As you evaluate the operating and productivity improvements, remember that we did this while taking on 5% more volume in 2024. I'm excited for John, Ed, and Jason to share our results with you. Let's start with John. John F. Orr: Good morning. Thanks, Mark. I'm excited to update you all on our safety and operating performance. Turning to Slide 6, safety is the value through which all operating decisions are made. Our entire team is committed and engaged in our pursuit of safety excellence. The improvements to date are a testament to the rigor of our safety protocols and a strong indication of the positive outcomes we can achieve in 2025. Our FRA reportable injury ratio increased from 1.1 to 1.15, and I'm encouraged that our Q4 results improved by 13% compared to the same period last year. In fact, in December, our FRA ratio was 0.61 and was the lowest reportable injury ratio since December of 2020. Our FRA train accident rate for the full year improved by 27%, and in both cases, we were carrying positive momentum into Q1 and building on these strong results. For example, we finished 2024 and started 2025, injury-free for over a million man hours across all operations. At Norfolk Southern, people are at the heart of our strategy. Our thoroughbred academy is educating thousands of leaders. Its curriculum offers an integrated approach that combines technical training with skill building in operational readiness, business planning, and management engagement. We are proactively driving safety performance and enterprise excellence. We are building generational railroaders. Turning to Slide 7, our PSR 2.0 approach is delivering simultaneous efficiency and service improvements. In 2024, our network performance progressively gained traction, anchored by dwell and velocity. We are dwelling less in yards, moving faster between terminals and right-sizing the fleet. This is generating fluidity and capacity, aligning our active fleets to volume, decreasing fleet maintenance expenses, and reducing capital. Year-over-year, our system speed improved by 10%, taking it down a level. In the quarter intermodal train speed gained 3.1%, and the true success stories were the remarkable gains in merchandise and unit train speeds, up 11% and 17% respectively. As we drove up velocity, we took out assets, grew the business, and we did more with less ultimately, growing volumes by 5%. For example, year-over-year car miles per car day rose over 13%. We are seeing similar benefits in our locomotive fleet. Velocity allowed us to store more locomotives, decrease our material expenses, increase our fleet reliability, and drove overall fleet productivity. Year-over-year, GTM's per available horsepower improved by 19% and we also delivered record fuel efficiencies, both for the quarter and the full year. As we drive operating efficiencies, we are also delivering a quality product for our customers. After all, we're a company committed to outstanding service. We've finished the year very strong, culminating with a successful intermodal, perfect peak season year-over-year, handling 7% more parcel volume per day with zero controllable failures. Turning to Slide 8 beats matter. In 2024, we committed to tackle network underperformance and to close our margin gap. As Mark said, through a total team effort, we exceeded. For example, our car maintenance war room meticulously drilled down to root causes, fine-tuned our repair processes, and provided near real-time feedback for the field. As a result, year-over-year running repair and repaired well were down 31% and 23% respectively. Improvements are also coming from our need for speed war room, whose mandate includes design speed into the network, overcome historic speed barriers, and drive out infrastructure bottlenecks. The need for speed war room has contributed to our year-over-year 10% AAR speed increase. They are now turning their attention to challenging every permanent and temporary slow order to actively reduce stops and drive additional fuel efficiencies. Over the road interruptions decreased by 25%, delivering significant gains in crew productivity and crew availability. For example, year-over-year, crew over time and terminal detention costs were both down 19%. When I say this is a team effort, I'm talking about every NS railroader. We are working cross-functionally, cross-structurally, and broadly across the entire enterprise ecosystem to eliminate waste, increase revenues, and drive efficiencies. These disciplines have allowed us to restructure our capital requirements, freeing up funds for key projects without compromise. We are entering 2025 with tremendous momentum, and we are unlocking productivity value for our network. The next phase transformation of our operating plan is in development. The new plan will roll out in Q1. It will further reduce handlings, introduce tighter standards for terminal times and connections, and will require us to continue stretching for improvement in our operating processes. In 2025, we will focus on fuel and mechanical infrastructure. These are big rocks for efficiencies and savings. I'm incredibly proud of the results the operating team has achieved in 2024. They rose to every challenge, showing NS grit, tenacity, and drive. Coupled with PSR 2.0, their capabilities are driving network value creation and closing the service and productivity gaps with our peers. I will now turn it over to Ed. Claude E. Elkins: Thank you, John and good morning, everyone. I apologize up front for my cold and ask that you bear with me here. Let's start on Slide 10. Overall volume for the fourth quarter improved 3% year-over-year, that was led by our intermodal and agriculture groups. Our total revenue and RPU declined primarily due to lower fuel surcharge revenue along with negative mix within the portfolio and rate pressure within intermodal and coal that we've noted for most of the year. Merchandise volume improved slightly from higher soybean and corn shipments driven by new business and some spot opportunities but these gains were offset by declines in automotive, metals, and energy related markets. The quarter saw a 2% increase in our RPU less fuel which marks another quarterly record in that metric with 38 out of 39 consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth. We also set quarterly RPU less fuel records for both industrial products and for automotive. In intermodal, we realized a 5% year-over-year volume increase with gains in both domestic and international through sales pipeline wins, increased freight demand, and empty container volumes. Premium continues to face market headwinds. Truck prices remain low, causing domestic intermodal rates to be generally in line with last quarter, however, note that RPU less fuel finished up 2% due to a lift from contract recoveries and rate true ups. Let's turn to coal, volume decreased 1% with coal prices driving a 9% decline in revenue. Utility experience reduced burn demand due to continued low natural gas prices while lower seaborne prices impacted our export business. Okay, moving to Slide 11, let's talk about full year results. We achieved strong 5% volume growth. Overall, revenue was flat as we faced significant fuel headwinds of $261 million, along with lower coal rates. The intermodal unit led the company in volume growth, and an important bright spot in revenue was the Merchandise Business Unit that achieved record revenue, revenue per unit, and RPU less fuel for the full year of 2024. Let's go to Slide 12 and look ahead. Our 2025 outlook is for modest volume growth driven by the reliable service product that our customers are enjoying now. For our Merchandise markets, we expect lower vehicle production due to weaker-than-expected sales and some inventory build. We expect improved manufacturing activities supported by lower interest rates and strength in our chemicals markets, such as plastics and waste. However, the potential for new tariffs will introduce some near-term uncertainty in the many markets that we serve. Despite these uncertainties, we are confident that we're well-positioned to recapture market share and deliver the value that our customers expect of us. Turning to our intermodal markets, USMX and ILA reached a tentative agreement which helps remove a key source of uncertainty. Strong import and export demand has been a growth driver, however, new tariffs will probably create some headwinds. We expect volume growth driven by new business and continued empty repositioning to partially offset these headwinds. Truck pricing has yet to recover, but excess capacity has finally started to come down. We're seeing some gradual improvement in some of the key industry metrics, such as increasing tender rejections. And we expect falling export prices in coal, along with softer demand for utility in our territory due to lower natural gas prices and generally elevated inventory levels. We're going to continue to keep a close eye on these factors as the year progresses. 2024 was a transformative year for us, and we now have reliable service that's consistent, resilient, and is built to grow in the market that we serve. I just want to end by once again thanking our customers for their partnerships and their trust as we move into 2025. And with that, I'll turn it over to Jason Zampi to review our financial results. Jason Zampi : Thanks, Ed. I'll start with Slide 14, which reconciles our GAAP results to the adjusted numbers that I'll speak to you today. There are four items I'd highlight for you. First, a net benefit of $43 million related to the Eastern Ohio incident. Insurance recoveries exceeded the incremental cost in the quarter. I'll recap where we are with these costs here momentarily. We also recognize the $53 million gain related to the finalization of the Virginia Line sale transaction, the first portion of which was recognized last quarter. Additionally, we continued to sunset certain technology projects, resulting in an additional $27 million in restructuring costs. And finally, as we have wound down the proxy campaign and signed the cooperation agreement, you'll note the final tranche of advisory costs incurred below the line in other income. Adjusting for these items, operating ratio for the quarter was 64.9 and EPS came to $3.04. Slide 15 provides a recap of the Eastern Ohio derailment-related financial impacts. You'll see that to date we've incurred nearly $2.2 billion related to the incident, with incremental costs in the current year related to the Class Action settlement, further environmental remediation efforts, and other community assistance. However, the pace of insurance recovery has accelerated, bringing in $650 million this year alone, and we have now recorded over $750 million in total. Moving to the comparison of our adjusted results versus last year and last quarter on Slide 16. We generated 390 basis points of operating ratio improvement in the face of revenue headwinds driven by strong productivity gains and that drops down to high single-digit net income in EPS growth. From a sequential perspective, the operating ratio was up 150 basis points, a little better than we had projected due to the approximate $20 million in contract recoveries that we recognized at the end of the quarter, as Ed just discussed. Drilling into the $153 million of year-over-year expense decline on Slide 17, you'll note improvements in all expense line items except depreciation, which was up on our larger asset base. Strong productivity improvements within labor and fuel efficiency drove over half of the expense improvement and helped to offset wage inflation and higher incentive comp accruals. In addition, purchase services was down $40 million year-over-year in the face of higher volumetric costs. Great progress in this cost category. You'll also note the materials expenses come down as we continue to store locomotives, yet another benefit of our fluid network. Turning to the full year results compared to 2023 on Slide 18, we had guided to a 100 to 150 basis point operating ratio improvement, and you'll see that we exceeded that commitment and delivered 160 basis points of improvement, and that's despite revenue being down slightly. It really comes down to a productivity story. John and his team over-delivered on productivity gains, exceeding our original $250 million target and delivering nearly $300 million of year-over-year cost savings. So, we're moving into 2025 with a lot of momentum from all fronts, operational, commercial, and financial. I'll turn it over to Mark to wrap up and discuss how we're thinking about 2025. Mark R. George: Thank you, Jason. So, you heard about the really strong performance to close out 2024. We have powerful momentum entering 2025. While markets are hard to predict at this point, we will lean into our outstanding service and the resolve of our people to capture share. We made that happen in 2024, and we are confident we will do it again in 2025. Turning now to guidance on Slide 20, we are planning on 3% revenue growth with positive volume and healthy core pricing more than offsetting headwinds from fuel and coal. One thing fully in our control is productivity. We exceeded our 2024 target of $250 million of cost takeout, and we are again looking to exceed the original $150 million target for 2025. That equation translates to margin expansion of 150 basis points, which is at the high end of our long-term baseline guidance range that called for OR improvements from 100 to 150 basis points per year. Ultimately, we will continue to close the margin gap with peers, whatever the volume environment. CAPEX will be in the $2.2 billion range. And with strong free cash flow driven by our operating performance, our balance sheet restoration will be complete in 2025 and allow us to resume share repurchases. So with that, let's get into Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. One moment, please, for your first question. Your first question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Chris Wetherbee : Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Maybe we can pick up on the productivity, Mark. Obviously, the 150 is the target for 2025. Maybe we could kind of break that down into buckets so we can understand where we can kind of source that and then if you sort of zoom out a little bit and think bigger picture over the next maybe couple of years, what you think the potential in OR is, you guys have made significant strides from where you were a year ago, I guess if you think about sort of the next couple of years, what do you see as the opportunity? Mark R. George: Hey, thanks, Chris. Appreciate the question. I'll have John talk to you a little bit about where we're seeing the runway on productivity, but we're really excited and confident because, we laid out the 250 target for 2024, we exceeded that. We think we can exceed, we know we can exceed the 2025 target that we laid out at 150, so we're going for more. We're really optimistic now going forward. And with regard to the long-term OR, I think we definitely have the self-help opportunities here to continue to improve OR. We put out the 100 to 150 basis point improvement guideline on the long-term basis on kind of a regular where we are volume environment. And once we get the kind of the surge, the economic recovery that we're expecting, that's kind of the turbo boost where I think we've got a path to that 60 range. So John, do you want to talk about the buckets? John F. Orr: Yeah, absolutely. Thanks, Chris. It's a really, really good question, one that we're really pushing ourselves hard to answer for everyone. And I think it starts and stops with our standards that we're increasing. We're coming off a great platform and bedrock of solid service and good productivity in 2024. We're building a new operating standard to increase the availability and reliability of important assets and the framework for continuous improvement in our tighter and more deliberate operating model. And it's going to be step functions across certain assets, utilization for cars, locomotives, even the rubber-tired vehicle fleet. Working hard across all segments of the business with IT and network infrastructure, and really right-sizing the network to the capabilities, increasing the skills and output of people through safety and the Thoroughbred Academy of Education, and really trying to align the headcount to the GTMs and really have a deliberate structure on how we onboard resources and deliver capability. Mark R. George: So Chris, I think as you look at the P&L, you're going to see it show up a little bit everywhere. Comp and Venn [ph] will be an area, again, where we can continue to be more efficient. We've taken out a ton of overtime and excess costs this year. There's more that John's identified by just running more efficient and cleaner connections in that line item. You remember, we had a pretty meaningful headcount reduction in 2024. We'll get the full year effect of that as well in 2025. But also, I think we'll see reductions in materials, as John just touched upon. We'll see reductions in fuel from efficiency improvements. And we'll even see improvements in purchase services, rents, car hire, equipment rents. So pretty much across the board. Thanks a lot, Chris. Chris Wetherbee : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Scott Group : Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Just on the 3% revenue growth for the year, any color on how to think about the mix of volume versus yield? And then maybe just want to follow up on the labor productivity side and really good in Q4 with volume up 3, head count down 5, how do you feel about incremental labor productivity opportunity in 2025? Claude E. Elkins: Hey Scott, it's Ed. I'll take on the first part of your question there, which I think was how do we think about the sort of mid-single digit 3% revenue growth next year. We expect growth in most of our markets. Coal is really the only place where we see a lot of weakness. But we still got a fuel headwind out there. We know going into this year, and coal price will be another headwind. So we expect volume growth and our price plan to deliver 3% against both of those headwinds. I'll turn it over to Jason. Jason Zampi : Yeah, I think on the labor productivity front, as you called out, I appreciate the call out there on the great labor productivity we've had in the fourth quarter. Probably more focused on the T&E side. And I think as we move into 2025, we'll not only have continued benefits there, but we've got some runway in labor productivity across all the operating ranks. John F. Orr: Yes. I couldn't agree more, Jason. And you think about our Q4 2024 versus 2023 where we had an 18.5% reduction in overtime and full year of almost 15%. And getting back to the basics, creating a lot more discipline within our terminals empowering and developing local supervisors to really drive that performance and creating that discretionary effort and things as baked as getting ahead of the labor negotiations and really distilling purpose and intent on how we engage with our craft employees. And it's all coming together and leading ourselves to some very, very solid productivity initiatives. Luke Nichols : Thanks a lot Scott. Scott Group : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Kenneth Hoexter : Hey great, good morning. Just if I can clarify on that on the volume comment, or I guess the revenue. Was that all volumes then you see yields fairly balanced and so it's all a volume commentary in terms of how you're looking at growth? And then thoughts on the buyback cadence into 2025? And lastly, John, I want to join the Need for Speed war room when you get a chance? John F. Orr: Hey Ken, we've always got a seat for you. Just bring your seatbelt because they move fast in there. Claude E. Elkins: Hey Ken, this is Ed. When I think about how we're going to deliver growth next year, it's really a combination. Yes, it's going to be led by volume across most of our markets and then we got a price plan that's going to be deflation again this year just as it has in the past. Jason Zampi : Yes. Ken, your second question on share repurchases, we've really done a good job this year rebuilding our balance sheet, and that's through really three fronts : improved profitability, the insurance recoveries that we've been able to achieve here, and the line sales. And our philosophy on those capital distributions hasn't changed. So we always invest in the business first, then pay dividends and then have share buybacks. Obviously, that was interrupted this year in 2023 and 2024, but we've got a path to delever the balance sheet throughout the year, and we're going to be able to start resuming share repurchases at a measured pace. And it's critical to us. That's a key component of our value creation framework that we laid out a couple of years ago. Mark R. George: Just to add a little bit more on the revenue because I think maybe others are probably also trying to hone in here on the volume. We do expect some volume growth, I think as we can say, probably a couple few points of volume growth. We're going to get good, really solid core pricing again, in particular, Merchandise. We probably don't have the headwinds in intermodal pricing like we've had to face. So -- and we're hoping that we'll start to see that maybe come up with a stronger truck market. And then we do have headwinds still with regard to fuel and in particular, coal pricing, but also co-volume. So you put it all in the mix master, and that's how you end up with the 3% revenue growth that we're guiding to. Thanks a lot. Kenneth Hoexter : Thanks. And can I just clarify one thing there, does that include the tariff thoughts or is that before any of that? Mark R. George: Yes. I mean, correct. That includes our outlook today. Kenneth Hoexter : Okay, thanks for your time. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Ossenbeck with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open. Brian Ossenbeck : I just wanted to ask a little bit more about pricing to the value of the service as it improves here and remains more consistent. So in the past, you've talked about maybe losing some market share based on some of the service challenges and disruptions that you had. So when that improves, do you see more of that as market share gain in recapture or do you see a little bit of upside of yield, or is it perhaps a little bit of both, so -- momentum interested to hear how that's progressing this year? Thank you. Claude E. Elkins: We -- this is Ed. Thanks for the question. It's a good one. It is. And we actually toss this around a lot internally. I think the way that I think about it and the way I would put forward the way that everyone else should think about it is we are very interested in how much wallet share we have with our customers. And whether that's share reclaim that's coming from somewhere else [indiscernible], or whether it's share that has never moved by rail, but now it has the opportunity to because of the value of the service that we're delivering. We're very interested in how we can expand our wallet share with our customers, both our existing customers and adjacent customers in the supply chain. So we're working really hard on that. In terms of pricing the value of the service, we've been very successful, particularly in our Merchandise markets where we offer exceptional value when we can deliver a good service product. We've been very diligent about being able to recognize that value through price and we fully expect to continue to do that again this year. The value of our service continues to improve as we deliver a reliable, resilient service that customers can count on every day. Mark R. George: So in short, Brian, both. We think that the value of really good service gives us leverage on both sides, pricing and volume share recapture, I should say. Brian Ossenbeck : Okay, understood. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Your line is now open. Thomas Wadewitz : Hi, yeah, good morning. And nice to see the continued strong momentum in what you're doing with the network and results as well. I wanted to see, I think, kind of following on Brian's question, how do you think about -- like you have optimism on chemicals being stronger. Is that just kind of customers doing well or is that gaining some share? And I think also at the beginning, Mark, you said customers are noticing. Are there specific examples where you say, okay, part of that chemicals is, hey, we got some new wins that are a component of that, are the new wins more likely to come in other segments, I guess just more around kind of where some of the growth comes from and do you already have some of that set up in terms of new business? Claude E. Elkins: Yes. That's a pretty good question. For us, when we look across our markets, particularly at our Merchandise markets, we know that we have -- our customers have suffered because of our service over time in a few very specific areas and one of those is chemicals. And so we're putting a lot of emphasis on making sure that we can deliver value in that particular segment. When I think about our local service product and how we deliver for our customers, John and I spent a lot of time. We were on the call this morning actually, talking about specific customers and how we can deliver more value for them on a much more ratable basis. And that's really fundamentally where we want to go, and that is to be very specific and targeted for wallet share with our customers. The second piece of this is as we deliver a better service and higher velocity, it actually gives us more agility inside the network to respond to what's going on in the marketplace. I look at our success in our Ag markets over the past two quarters where we were able to actually be very agile and take advantage of what the market was offering in a way that we couldn't have previously as a good example of that. In terms of other markets where we see growth, I think intermodal is going to lead growth this year. They did last year. They will again this year, we have a very bullish consumer still, and it appears we have a very resilient economy. So I think both of those things are going to manifest themselves in more opportunity for us with a better service product. Mark R. George: Yes. I mean we've had a really good intermodal service product for a couple of years now, but it is at extraordinarily high levels. Thomas Wadewitz : Okay. But I guess, to be clear on the chemicals comment, though, you are -- you have visibility to some business coming back. That's not just say chemicals market looks good. That's like getting business back as well as maybe some growth in market? Claude E. Elkins: That's correct. Yes, we have line of sight to specific wallet share opportunity that we're on top of. Thomas Wadewitz : Great, thank you. Luke Nichols : Thank you Tom. Operator : Your next question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Your line is now open. Brandon Oglenski : Hey good morning everyone and thank you for taking the question. John, I was wondering if you could elaborate on the changes you're making to the op plan this year. I think you called it a refreshment in slides, but maybe like a newer operating plan in your comments. So can you maybe elaborate more there? John F. Orr: Yes, absolutely. The refreshment or the new operating plan, as you call it, is really the next iteration of continuous improvement. We've been churning out improvements in our terminals that was our starting point on-time performance and over the road speed. And as we've moved through the progression of improvement on our network health, our asset efficiencies, and our customer-facing metrics, the next evolution is tightening down standards. So connection standards and terminals, creating better yield for our train weights, for or our customization of the service that Ed needs in order to be competitive and to grow the business. We're looking then over the road and how do we make our end to end a lot more competitive. And once we do that, and we leverage up on the speed increases that we've got, sizing our service plan to meet that speed. And that gives us a lot of flexibility to use our collective articles on employee availability and accessibility to do more at the front end of the trip or the back end of the trip and start to really yield on productivity. It will help us right size our fleet, right size our cars, and really be more disciplined in how we operate. Mark R. George: So to reduce handling... John F. Orr: Yes, absolutely. And again, back to that philosophy of extending the length of the trains as long as possible that will allow us to leave our locomotives in active service longer. That will reduce the dwell time of locomotives, the demand of locomotives, the fuel consumption, all of those things. So it took a while. It took the last nine months of heavy lifting to get us in a position to take this next step, and it will be one of many iterations as we continue to improve, but very confident in the capability of the team to deliver. Brandon Oglenski : Thanks John. John F. Orr: Brandon, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Walter Spracklin : Yeah, thanks so much Operator. Good morning everyone. So this question is for John. John, I know you've been targeting 100 to 150 basis point OR improvement, and it's still a bit of a gap relative to peers. So my question is what's kind of holding it back from a faster clip and I know you when you go Hunter go over summary, you just be fast and furious and kind of take a hatchet to that OR. Are you protecting customer service, is constraints in labor agreements, just curious as to what -- where we could see upside to that speed like we did in 2024 and what might be holding it back, if anything? John F. Orr: Well, I'll tell you, we're not leaving any stone unturned, let's just be clear about that. And we have to set a flag in our budget. Jason's got me challenged on a number of things, including how do we increase our car miles per day, our fuel efficiencies, our re-crews. I mean he's right down to the taxis on me. But what I think is that we're going to leverage up on our locomotive productivity. We've got big rocks to gain on our fuel and our purchasing services. And so while we finished the year slightly ahead of our guidance, and really, really proud of the team for the $292 million or $293 million in cost takeout. We're attacking everything. And I'll go back to the last question, is that restructuring the operating plan to leverage up on the disciplined approach to improvement is putting more pressure on me and the team to deliver to a higher standard. I love our war room mentality where we triage problems, we pull it out of the triage in the day-to-day and elevate it up to continuous improvement philosophies and educate people, drive out anomalies from the system, or give us a better competitive edge. And so these are things that Hunter didn't really do and we're doing it and its Mark's leadership, it's a partnership I've got with Ed and Jason that are giving us a holistic approach to this. So there's no stone unturned. We're not holding back. There's nothing structural that's holding me back. We're locked in on the continuous improvement agenda. And our customers are why we're here. And I will not foreclose on our customer capability for a few cents of advancement. I know that's going to come. And we're going to do it in a disciplined way. Mark R. George: Walter, obviously, there's a lot of history that you probably have studied about the pace of change that happened in some of the other roads. I would say I'm super proud of John's cerebral approach to what he's doing here. It's a very cerebral approach based on all the lessons that he learned being part of it in the past, which is why he calls it and brands it 2.0, PSR 2.0. So the evidence is here that we're doing this while we're taking on more volume and not compromising customer service. So I think this is -- it's a great story, and I think we should all be proud of John for what he's doing here. John F. Orr: I'm proud of the whole team. It's a team effort. It takes everybody here. Walter Spracklin : Yes, you're definitely delivering and just keep it up. I appreciate it. Thanks so much. John F. Orr: Thank you Walter. Operator : Your next question comes from Jason Seidl with TD Cowen. Your line is now open. Jason H. Seidl: Hey, thank you, operator. Mark and team, congrats on the good quarter. And I hope you feel better, sir. Wanted to focus a little bit on the intermodal performance and the Merchandise trip plan compliance, clearly much better than last year when you look at that. But there was what I think is probably more of a seasonal dip in 4Q. Can you talk to us about two things, one, what's the normal seasonal progression from Q3 to Q4 for both those measures and what should we expect going forward in 2025? John F. Orr: Well, why don't I start it because you hold me accountable for delivering trip plans and we've got really good trip plans especially in the quarter. But we're hard on ourselves. I mean, we came through the fourth quarter despite getting hit by a number of hurricanes and port strikes and started this year into the polar vortex. But we -- my philosophy is drive hard, go as deep into the environmental conditions as you possibly can without being impacted, and work like the devil to get out of it as fast as you can. And we saw that. We saw some V-shaped impacts to these things but overall, when we came back strong, we were able to recover it fairly quickly. And I think we over communicated with our customers and prepared for the worst and delivered pretty solid results. Claude E. Elkins: Yes, here's what I would say about the third quarter and fourth quarter progression. We had a lot of things going on this year, and I say we as a royal way, the whole industry did, whether it was a couple of hurricanes. One report stoppage and one threat of another one, which really distorted volumes and volume flows. And I'm very proud of the way that we responded to both of those challenges with regard to snapping back, that's really the definition of resilience. Something changes, you get hit with something you didn't expect, how fast you snap back to the norm. I think we did really adjust. John F. Orr: Yes. And I think they were underpinned by a 3.5 -- 3.1% improvement in overall velocity that allowed us to get end-to-end on intermodal. And what I really love is a merchandising unit trains were up 11% and 17%, respectively in the same period. So all of our trains rose with that tide of continuous improvement. Jason H. Seidl: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Joseph Hafling : Hi, good morning. This is Joe Hafling for Stephanie Moore. Congrats on the good results. Maybe piggybacking on a question we heard earlier, John, on sort of the next phase of optimization you specifically called out mechanical infrastructure and some fuel efficiency gains. I guess, could you help me understand maybe more specifically, what are some of the items that you're looking to tackle and kind of what the magnitude of those savings could look like? John F. Orr: For sure and I'll just start with fuel. It's a number of things, including we finished 2024 at a 1.0 fuel efficiencies. And we had a bit of a headwind coming in, in Q1 of 2024, we were at 1.22 and we really worked hard to get it down to where we were that ended up at a fairly solid number and a record in the quarter and a record in the year. So that was founded by having a really strong balance on HPT and disciplined use of distributed power, rightsized locomotives for the right-sized trains, stopping less. So the number of disruptions over the road decreased significantly because of our mechanical war room and then the intelligence we could gather there. So we're building better trains, more capable trains across the road. And when you're idling cars and idling locomotives, you're not wasting fuel. So our fuel productivity was increased because of our over-the-road capability and the discipline of pulling out additional resources, storing them, and having more constrained asset utilization. So our locomotives dwelled lasting between work events. We're also looking at a deliberate impact on how we distribute fuel. So our vendors, the vendor structures, the distribution systems and all of those things that the categories that drive ownership reduction and new discipline arbitrage opportunities and balancing out how we self-supply our locomotive fleet with fuel. So those things are in flight. We started to really get traction towards the latter part of the year. We're doing it on a quasi-manual basis right now, and we expect as the year progresses, we'll have further and further automation towards that. And I would say we're also pretty blessed with our energy management systems that we've put in place towards the latter part of the year that have delivered significant results. From a mechanical process, we're looking at all of the assets and how we cycle our car fleet and locomotive fleet for repair. So the physical assets, the production that we've done, and even the AAR visibility on how we bill and how we get value from our locomotive -- or sorry, our mechanical efforts on car. So all of these things are in flight, and we'll really start to see strong performance on those things as we get through the year. I don\u2019t know Jason, if you have any perfect color on that? Jason Zampi : No, I think those -- as you mentioned, John, I think those are going to be the key, some of the key areas as we think about our productivity moving into 2025 and then really accelerating on that total commitment there of $150 million plus. So that's great. Joseph Hafling : That\u2019s really helpful guys, thank you so much. Congrats again. Operator : Your next question comes from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Your line is now open. Bascome Majors : Mark, you've been in the CEO seat of almost five months now. You've gone through your first annual planning process as CEO, a couple board meetings. Can you talk a little bit about the Board dynamics, where everyone is clearly aligned and what's the Board's number one priority for you and senior management is over the next 12 to 18 months? Thank you. Mark R. George: Thanks, Bascome. Look, our Board has been really remarkably unified. It came from different avenues. We've got a lot of new Board Members. The majority of them are within the past 18 months yet they've all congealed in a beautiful way in the boardroom. And I'm really pleased to see the engagement from all quarters and the mutual respect that's being shown given everybody's unique background. So I would say that their principal objective, and we had a Board meeting yesterday actually. And the questions are, what can we do to help support management on its journey because they know -- they believe in the strategy, they believe that it's yielding results. They believe in the team that we've assembled, which I'm super proud of. And they really just want to be as supportive as they can but also coach and guide where they see opportunities. So right now, I'm thrilled with the dynamic, and I think our management team feels fully supported by the Board as well. John F. Orr: Thanks Bascome. Operator : Your next question comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Ravi Shanker : Great, thanks. Good morning everyone. Just a clarification here. You mentioned tariff headwinds to volumes through the course of the year. But do you expect to see tariff tailwinds before that, kind of what are you hearing on potentially shippers restocking and that\u2019s slower into the railroad side potentially being a tailwind before we see the headwinds? Mark R. George: Ravi, I think what we said is uncertainty around tariffs. And I think reasonable people can have differing opinions on how tariffs may impact their business. But in -- certainly in the rail transportation space, I have a different view that maybe even Ed made mildly disagree with. But these things take a while to play out. We don't know how they're going to play out. And from a producer's perspective, a manufacturer's perspective, if suddenly they're subjected to tariffs, how they respond may vary, where are the alternative sources. At the end of the day, things will play out over time, but we moved the U.S. economy. We moved GDP. And whether that GDP is coming across the border as an import or whether it's now being produced domestically due to some onshoring, we're going to be there to move it. So I kind of think it's going to be a net wash in terms of volume. But it could play out a little bit different. And the beauty is that our network now is nimble enough to adjust to wherever the change in the source of supply comes from. So I wouldn't say that we're baking in, and I think Ken tried to ask that question, but I don't think we're baking in a particular headwind per se. It's just we're nimble enough. We don't know exactly how it's all going to manifest, but we'll be ready to move it, whether it's domestic, whether it's crossing the border as an international move. Ed, why don't you clean that up a little? Claude E. Elkins: Look, I don't disagree at all. I think our customers would tell you that they all have different opinions on how it's going to manifest itself or not. But look, let's talk about some facts. Over three quarters of our business is tied to our domestic economy that leaves less than 25% that's tied to international trade. And I think you're exactly right, Mark. And I'm not saying that because you're my boss. But I think you're exactly right. We have enough operational nimbleness now. And frankly, with the capability that we're developing in our sales force that we're going to be able to respond to whatever the economy delivers and whatever trade policy delivers. We're going to be there to make the most of those opportunities, whether they're domestic or international. Ravi Shanker : Understood, thank you. Mark R. George: Thank you Ravi. Operator : Your next question comes from Daniel Imbro with Stephens. Your line is now open. Daniel Imbro : Yeah, hey good morning guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe one just on the coal outlook. You mentioned a few times expecting more bearish outlook versus your prior expectations meant in the slide deck. I guess, can you talk about what's driving that softer outlook given the stronger back half of 2024 results there? And then any update on the contract you're bringing online this year. I think it was about 5 million tons annually when you announced it, but is that still the right way to think about contribution and when should that sort of flow into numbers? Thanks. Mark R. George: I think you're referring to coal, is that right, Daniel? I couldn't hear you at the beginning... Daniel Imbro : Sorry. Yes, the coal side. Mark R. George: When we look at the forward curves, that's the first thing that we look at when we think about what's going on with the international markets and coal price has been under pressure now for couple of quarters, and we see that continuing. I think there's probably a downside risk for the market in that particular dimension. On the volume side, we'll have to wait and see. I think that there's clearly some downdraft in terms of demand currently on the seaborne side. And then on the domestic side, we've had a couple of nice winter weeks here, which probably has helped burn rates, but there's still plenty of stockpile out there on the utility side. We're watching gas prices, Nat gas prices very closely, which I think will help determine the trajectory going forward for that domestic demand on the utility side. John F. Orr: I think that's an important variable of Nat gas. There's upside if Nat gas prices go up, and they've moved up a little bit in recent weeks. But right now, that's not the way the curves are indicated. Claude E. Elkins: And your second question was about our new customer, yes, we expect to see volumes from that coming on in the second quarter and going forward. Mark R. George: Thank you Daniel. Operator : Your next question comes from David Vernon with Bernstein. Your line is now open. David Vernon : Hey, good morning guys. And thanks for fitting me in here. So Ed, can you help us understand kind of how we should be modeling sort of the average RPU in coal kind of moving forward here sequentially? And then a secondary question for the broader team. If you're thinking about the 150 bps of OR improvement kind of year-over-year, is there anything that we should note around seasonality or when those gains should be showing up in terms of the margin performance, got a lot of questions around whether 1Q is going to be getting hit from export coal falling or remarketing some of those contracts, I'm just trying to kind of blend that all together if you could help us shape out what the -- when that headwind starts to hit for 2025? Thanks. Claude E. Elkins: Well, I think the headwind is kind of there now and probably continues going forward. As we get later in the year... Mark R. George: He's asking about coal RPU. Claude E. Elkins: Yes, that's the a what I'm talking about. And we see that seaborne price is down now. It's going to continue to be down, we think, certainly in the near to medium term. Longer term, as the year manifests off, we're just going to keep adjusting our models. But we think there's probably still some downside that we baked into our models and I think that everyone else should too. Jason Zampi : And David, on your question on the OR, we're -- we've got a lot of momentum from our strong service product and operational progress. And that's really what makes us confident to guide at that top end of our original range. So that 150 basis points of annual improvement. I'd point out that, that improvement is in the face of nearly 200 basis points of pressure on the OR from inflation, fuel price, and depreciation headwinds. If you think about it in the quarters, I would just say there's puts and takes in the individual quarters. For example, you've got the timing of incentive comp in the first quarter, things like seasonality of volumes and the timing of wage increases, you know all those. But so when you average it all out, we're again confident in that ability to deliver the 150 basis points of annual improvement despite those headwinds. Daniel Imbro : Does the momentum comment, push some of that more in the first half of the year or is that -- is it offset by some of those seasonal factors you mentioned? Jason Zampi : I think the momentum I'm referring to is just our operational momentum, and we're really pleased with how that's going, I think, on all fronts. David Vernon : Alright, thanks guys and congrats on your first quarter here. Thanks. Mark R. George: Thank you David. Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from Ari Rosa with Citigroup. Your line is now open. Ariel Rosa : Hi, good morning. So you mentioned some of the port stoppages distorting volume flows. I just wanted to get your perspective on to what extent we might have seen pull forward of volume in fourth quarter, given some of the strong intermodal results that we saw there? And then to what extent did you kind of have to add costs or add resources to manage through some of those -- some of the variability in the kind of port stoppages or variability in volume? Thanks. Claude E. Elkins: Sure. This is Ed. I think we did see certainly during the third and fourth quarters, more volume turned back to the West Coast or East Coast, some East Coast destinations, and we were able to handle that really and truly, I think, I'll defer to John, but without much of a hiccup in terms of additional resources or train starts. It was really incremental volume on existing trains with very good service product, which kept fluidity rolling. Probably the biggest challenge for us was attempting to make sure that we were servicing our customers on the East Coast as long as we could up until the anticipated work stoppage. And thankfully, that didn't happen. John, you got any other commentary on that? John F. Orr: I absolutely agree with your assessment. We were able to handle it very well. I think we communicated pretty effectively and knew what we're up against. There was a little bit of slushiness in the car supply. That was a sector issue, but we're able to smooth that out really quickly and get back on track as soon as the market gives us a chance to. Ariel Rosa : Yeah, thanks for the question. Operator : Your next question comes from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Jordan Alliger : Yeah, hi. Good morning. So I think a week or so ago, you put out a release talking about industrial development across your network, adding about $150,000 of incremental carloads sort of tailwind on that active pipeline. I'm just curious sort of the timing of this and is some of that even factored into 2025, and what's the potential for that to upsize over time? Thanks. Mark R. George: We have a nice, very robust pipeline and pipeline process for our industrial development team. In the fourth quarter, we had eight new locations and four facility expansions that came online. And our 2025 pipeline continues to be very strong. Those numbers we put out really are going to manifest themselves throughout the year and represents full production for those facilities. And the great thing about it is these are projects that are not just for this year, but therefore, hopefully, many years to come. And I think that's just a powerful testament to the value we can offer customers with the service that we offer. Thanks for the question. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the conference over to management for closing remarks. Mark R. George: Okay. Thank you, everyone. We really appreciate you all participating, and we look forward to connecting throughout the quarter. Be safe. Take care. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your conference call for today. We thank you for participating and ask that you please disconnect your lines.",
