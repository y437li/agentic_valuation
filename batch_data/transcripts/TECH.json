Melsen - Chief Financial Officer, Vice President of Finance and Treasurer Analysts : Steven F. Crowley - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division Justin Bowers - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division Jeffrey T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division Michael W. Seppelt - Evercore Wealth Management, LLC Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Techne Corporation's earnings conference call for the first quarter of its fiscal year 2014. Hosting this call today is Chuck Kummeth, Chief Executive Officer of the Techne Corporation. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Chuck Kummeth. Charles R. Kummeth: Thank you, Alicia, and welcome to Techne Corporation's first-ever quarterly conference call. Today, we'll discuss the earnings results for the first quarter fiscal 2014 that were released earlier this morning. Greg Melsen, the company's Chief Financial Officer, is with me on the call today. Our plan this morning is for Greg to provide a review of our financial results for the first fiscal quarter of 2014. I will then address several topics and be open to your questions. Greg? Gregory J. Melsen: Before discussing the financial details for the quarter, allow me to remind you that some of the statements made during this conference call may be considered forward-looking statements. The company's 10-K for fiscal year 2013 and the 10-Q that will be filed for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2013, identifies certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made this morning. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of the new information or future events or developments. The 10-K and 10-Q as well as the company's other SEC filings are available through the company or online. During the call, non-GAAP financial measures may be used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. Tables reconciling these measures to most comparable GAAP measurements are available in the company's press release issued earlier this morning or on the Techne Corporation website at www.techne-corp.com. Sales as reported increased 14.2% to $85.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2013. Organic sales increased 5.1% for the quarter. These organic sales exclude $6.2 million of Bionostics product sales and $610,000 of favorable foreign currency exchange fluctuation. The Bionostics acquisition was completed in July 2013. Adjusted earnings were $30.7 million or $0.83 per share for the first quarter of 2014, an 11.6% increase over adjusted EPS of $0.75 for the first fiscal quarter of 2013. Adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share exclude intangible asset amortization, cost recognized upon the sale of inventory that was written up to fair value as part of the acquisition and professional fees related to the Bionostics acquisition. The company operates 2 reportable segments based on the nature of its products. Our largest segment is the Biotechnology segment, a segment that develops, manufactures and sells biotechnology research and diagnostic products worldwide. This segment includes R&D Systems, Biotechnology Division, R&D Europe, Tocris, R&D China, BiosPacific and Boston Biochem. The Biotechnology segment sales were $73.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2013, an increase of 4.4% after adjustments for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Our second segment is now called Clinical Controls, a segment we've previously referred to as the hematology segment. This segment develops, manufactures controls and calibrators for worldwide sales. The Clinical Controls segment now includes sales made through R&D Systems, Clinical Controls Division and the newly acquired Bionostics. Clinical Controls sales for the quarter ended September 30, 2013 were $12.5 million. The sales growth for the quarter ended September 30, 2013 was 13.3% if sales of Bionostics products are excluded. This increase was mainly the result of the timing of shipments at both the beginning and end of the quarter. A couple of comments regarding key Biotechnology segment customer and geographies may be helpful. About 55% of our biotech sales are generated in the United States. The 2 largest U.S. customer groups are the industrial market, which includes pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies of all sizes, and the academic research market. Sales to U.S. industrial pharmaceutical and biotech customers increased by 6.3% in the quarter ended September 30, 2013, as compared to the same period last year. We have now experienced improving sales from these U.S. customers during each of the past 3 quarters. We expect and hope that these customers will continue their commitment to research investment. Sales to U.S. academic customers declined 11.8% during the quarter ended September 30, 2013, as compared to the same period last year. This is the ninth straight quarter of sales declines in this customer segment. As you all know, the U.S. academic market is highly dependent on funding from the National Institute of Health. Unfortunately, sequestration moved from a threat to reality last March 31, requiring 8% cut across the NIH budget. The recent government shutdown compounded this situation. We don't know how long this will last. But what is known is that the disruption and angst in the academic research labs will remain high until there's clarity regarding the NIH budget. Europe is our other major biotech market. About 28% of biotech sales are derived from this continent. Like the U.S., the major customer groups in Europe are the academic market in pharma and biotech companies. Organic growth in Europe, which excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, was 1.5% in the quarter. This was a slight improvement following basically flat sales in fiscal 2013 and declines in each quarter of fiscal 2012. European academic sales were relatively flat during the quarter with sales growth being derived from biotech and mid-sized pharma customers. Germany again showed sales growth in the quarter with slight sales declines being experienced in the U.K. and France. Sales in China increased by 38% in the quarter ended September 30, 2013, as compared to the same period last year. Our China presence has been growing at about 20% or more for each year since we established an operation there in fiscal 2006. This growth improved dramatically in the most recent quarter due to an expanded sales staff in a relatively small base of business. China now generates about 6% of consolidated sales. Although this is relatively small, a China presence is important to our strategy of global reach and growth. Pacific Rim sales increased by almost 14% in the quarter ended September 30, 2013, as compared to the same period last year. The first quarter strength is due to comparison against a weak first quarter a year ago and the emphasis we are placing on Asia's sales growth. About 9% of our biotech sales are generated in the Pacific Rim solely through our distribution partners. Japan, Korea and Taiwan are the leading countries in this geography. Gross margins adjusted for cost recognized upon the sale of acquired inventory and amortization of intangible assets were 74.4% and 76.8% for the quarters ended September 30, 2013, and 2012, respectively. The decrease in adjusted gross margins for the quarter was primarily caused by a change in product mix from higher-margin Biotechnology segment sales to Clinical Control segment sales as a result of the Bionostics acquisition. The impact of the medical device excise tax also slightly reduced the gross profit margin. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2013, increased $3.7 million from the quarter ended September 30, 2012. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter included $532,000 of professional fees related to the acquisition of Bionostics, $1.1 million of selling, general and administrative expenses by Bionostics after the acquisition date and an increase in intangible assets amortization of $736,000 related to this acquisition. The remaining increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2013, was mainly the result of increased executive compensation and additional sales staff added since the first quarter of fiscal 2013. Research and development expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2013, increased $250,000 or 3.3% from the quarter ended September 30, 2012, mainly due to research and development expenses by Bionostics. The effective tax rate for the quarter ended September 30, 2013, was 30.8% compared to 32.4% for the same period last year. The decrease in effective tax rate was primarily the result of decreased tax rates in the U.K. and the increased percentage of pretax income from foreign operations, which have lower income tax rates than the U.S. I will conclude today's financial discussion with a few balance sheet and cash flow comments. At September 30, 2013, Techne has $323 million of cash and available-for-sale investments and had no debt. We generated $32.6 million from operations in the quarter ended September 30, 2013. This is an 11% increase over the $29.3 million of cash generated from operations in the comparable prior year quarter. We used $103 million for the Bionostics acquisition, $11 million was returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and $3.8 million was invested in capital expenditures. The available-for-sale investments also declined $54 million due to a decline in ChemoCentryx market cap. A couple of months ago, ChemoCentryx learned of some less-than-desired clinical results, which negatively impacted their market valuation. We view this as temporary and maintain confidence in ChemoCentryx due to the multiple compounds they are developing. This is an investment we believe and hope will yield additional returns in future years. I will now turn the program back to Chuck Kummeth for his additional comments and observations. Charles R. Kummeth: Thanks, Greg. One of the most important aspects of our third quarter results is that the pipeline [indiscernible] for our organic sales growth is the highest level of sales growth since the June quarter of 2011. This suggests strategic planning unveiled in late September [indiscernible] and starting to deliver some tangible results. I would like to add a few supplemental comments regarding our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 in the markets we serve. I will also make a few comments regarding our product offerings and a couple regarding the progress we are making with our strategic plan. The U.S., European and Asian markets all have very different market dynamics and are also working in different economic environments. As Greg discussed, we are gaining traction in the U.S. pharma and biotech markets but are facing difficult pressures in the U.S. academic arena. Thousands of large and small pharmaceutical and biotech companies comprise the commercial portion of our North American sales. The largest of these companies have continued to refine their business models, including plant closures, staff restructuring and outsourcing. As we stated on our late September strategy call, we believe these customers have a need for innovative new products and further believe investments in research is a key to our long-term success of [indiscernible]. At that time, we projected this customer group could reasonably expand at a low single-digit growth rate. The first quarter sales growth of this customer segment confirms our expectations. Conversely, sales to our U.S. academic customers have been declining due to uncertainties regarding high-level sustainability of academic funding. A major portion of U.S. academic research funding is provided by the National Institute of Health, NIH. There is a widespread perception NIH money is relatively protected in the federal budget process. However, the arbitrary cuts from sequestration and the recent government shutdown, again researchers have good reason to be cautious in their spending. We expect the sales for this group of customers will be under severe pressure in the near future. The pharma and biotech industries in Europe are also having difficulties, especially larger companies. Plant closures, restructuring and movements to [indiscernible] Asia or India have lessened growth in this sector. We've anniversary-ed many of these changes. And in late September, we believe -- we stated we believe these customers will begin showing single-digit sales growth. This was also confirmed by our most recent quarterly results. However, we also expect our European academic customer segment to grow in the low single-digits. Sales to this customer group were actually relatively flat in the quarter. Weakness in the financial health of various country governments in Europe has been detrimental because these administrations have a [indiscernible] of funding. As we also articulated in late September, our best growth opportunities are in China and the Pacific Rim, where research is expanding at a very rapid rate. We expect overall customer growth in these regions will be in the high single-digits and double-digits during fiscal 2014. We exceeded these expectations in the first quarter and continue to believe we are underrepresented in these countries. This geography is a key to our growth strategy. We have already begun to be more aggressive in our commercial strategies through the addition of sales leadership and staff in both the U.S. and Asia. We have seen initial value of these investments and believe there will be additional value occurring in future quarters. Our sales growth in all markets and geographies is highly dependent on the breadth and depth of our product offering. Protein builds the foundation of our product portfolio. We have a leadership position with our bioactive protein products. And our strategy will be to build on this leadership position in the protein areas through product improvement and innovation. We will also continue to focus on new protein product introductions, which are the leading edge of new research. We are in the early stages of developing a key opinion leader strategy to help address this. We are also early in a plan to place greater emphasis on GMP products, as tools of potential interest to the preclinical research community. These strategies are important since high-quality proteins are the key to the generation of good antibodies and reliable immunoassays. While we are making progress in protein, much work remains in the antibody and immunoassays area. The antibody market is very competitive. However, we are in a good position to take advantage of our unique portfolio of bioactive proteins by developing products which have applications of significant competitive advantage, specifically related to the immunoassay [indiscernible]. We will continue our emphasis in launching immunoassay grade antibodies, which are likely to have utility in a variety of testing platforms. We also excelled in developing high-quality immunoassay ELISA kits, which have become reference standards for new technology but also have more work to accomplish in this area. We are striving to retain our leadership position in the immunoassay market with continued development of traditional immunoassay products while simultaneously looking to identify technology and platforms which can best leverage our portfolio of antibody content. Partnerships and/or acquisitions may allow us to execute such technology. More aggressive OEM and outsourcing relationships are also possibilities. My final prepared comments relate to our improved operational activities. We have reorganized our research developments and operational function and have also already begun to create more infrastructure around our operation. Launching over 1,500 new products a year is difficult, and thus the new organizational structure will reduce its complexity and improve the prioritization of the product pipeline. These changes should improve our output and innovation. Better balancing our resources with our priorities will hopefully commercialize more impactful products as well. These changes required a lot of work on part of the management team, and I'm extremely proud of the solutions we have found to improve our business. This leadership group is now being powered and held accountable to a greater degree than in previous times. They are also now incentivized with a reward system that acknowledges and values their contributions to making the company's success. In conclusion, Techne is continuing to focus on the operating discipline, balance sheet and cash flow needed to fund our growth and to continue to return cash to shareholders as appropriate. We will also be strengthening our growth program on selected discipline acquisitions that will enhance our sales growth rate. Our first quarter results reflect that we are successfully beginning to implement our strategic plan to accelerate sales growth. We will now turn the program back to our moderator and entertain your questions and comments. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Steven Crowley of Craig-Hallum. Steven F. Crowley - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division : In terms of a couple of questions, you high-spotted or actually hit on a couple of the highlights of the performance, China, with a significant acceleration, U.S., with a nice acceleration. Can you talk to us about what you've done with the sales and marketing infrastructure in both of those geographies and whether you think some of that investment is already being reflected in payback this quarter or whether or not that's really in front of us? Charles R. Kummeth: As I mentioned, we have made investments in the, I'll say, the 4 major quarters of the country. And we started very early from [indiscernible] onboard, and they started producing quite quickly. They're not all producing. We did hire them all at the same time. But there's enough for the data to show that it is working in some degree now. One quarter doesn't -- and one data point doesn't make a trend or anything else. But we like what we're seeing. I think things change. I think it's time for having more feet in the street right at the customers' site. And I think it's the right way to go. Same thing goes for Asia and China. Particularly, we more or less doubled our sales force in China over the last few months. We opened an office in Beijing. And as you noticed, 38% growth is quite a bit higher than 20%. Again, it's a small base, as Greg pointed out. So it's the beginning of the right tracking. And I think it will continue higher than 20%, and hopefully at the level that it's at currently and maybe even more. We'll see, we're not done investing in the commercial side in China as well. In Europe, we really are more doing an update. And we have a more or less field sales model in Europe and it's actually looking quite well. Steven F. Crowley - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division : Now in terms of the U.S. and the opportunity to influence the sales line, in these geographies where you put, from what it sounds like, relatively senior salespeople, is it getting deeper into the larger accounts and cross-selling? Or is it getting to the second- and third-tier customers that you haven't been able always to effectively get to in the past? Charles R. Kummeth: It's a little all of the above. I mean, these aren't rock stars we hired. These are very senior experienced people that could hit the ground running, that knew our products, knew the market, knew the customers, knew all our key customers in those regions. And so the territories have been a little bit split between how we handle them from here in Minneapolis to where we're now local but also allowing more room for that prospecting element that was missing in the local regions. There are a lot of feeder [ph] companies in biotech in the second tier. And even all the call points of major institutions, quite frankly, I'm not sure we're addressing them all. So it will be a team approach. And with having a front edge here, we've got the territory. More of a classical model, I guess. Steven F. Crowley - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division : And in terms of Asia Pacific, which also seemed to do well, my sense is you brought on some resources to more actively structure and manage distribution in those markets. Can you talk to us a little bit about how you're operating differently in those markets? Charles R. Kummeth: Well, as we get larger, we'll bring on more infrastructure. We do keep inventory in China. And we're looking at investing in a hub and other tax-free zones to supplement our growth and take care of on-time delivery concerns and metrics that I'm used to doing. As we move forward there, I think it's a little bit slower view as in the U.S. because you're hiring the younger people. As you know, attrition is higher in China. It is by definition, so it's a little more interesting. But we're also going more aggressively. And the doubling of the workforce in 6 months is a pretty good start in terms of revenue. So I think as we get bigger, we'll have to back it up with other infrastructure. But right now, it's going pretty well. Steven F. Crowley - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division : All right. And just one follow-up and I'll jump in the queue. In terms of Asia -- that question was actually more geared to some of those other international markets, the Asia Pacific distribution served community, Korea, Japan, some of your other markets and what you maybe able to do to pull that lever harder. Charles R. Kummeth: Okay, I get you. So yes, up until recently, we were managing all our distribution from Minneapolis and all the different countries in Asia. So now we've hired some of these resources that are actually located in the region, actually living in Singapore, that will manage distributors. And this is the right way to go, we feel, as we'll be closely involved with them, working with them on their metrics, their business plans, objectives, their targets and their results month-on-month. Operator : Our next question is from Sam Jones [ph] of Citigroup. Our next question will come from Amanda Murphy of William Blair. Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : I'm curious, and I'm not sure if you're willing to do this, but is there -- are you able to quantify to some degree the growth rates in the various -- the 3 main business lines between proteins, antibodies and immunoassays? Charles R. Kummeth: Yes, we don't disclose those, Amanda. Appreciate the question, but we don't disclose at this time. Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : Okay, fair enough. And then in terms of the sales reps that you've added in the U.S., I think we talked before about how productive the reps are that you have already in-house. So I guess, my question is how much do you expect these new reps to add per rep over time? And also is there room -- or are you planning on adding more reps in the U.S.? I know you said that ultimately you'll expand in China, but I didn't catch if you said that you were still looking to add in the U.S. as well. Charles R. Kummeth: We went more than a couple of decades with absolutely nobody in the field with an inside model. And it worked very well because our content was just so good and so important and so well recognized. There is more competition. I think we're moving with the times. We'll have these people, these very senior players in the key markets. I can think of a couple more. [indiscernible] think about one of the areas. As we add more, I think, will depend on how they do produce and how we measure the gap. I mean, there's no better way to find growth than sell more of the stuff you have because you have a coverage gap and we have to be very, I think, vigilant with our customers in these regions to see if we are getting them around the loop. We're seeing good progress. It's definitely good progress. But it's one quarter, so we'll see how it goes. I also am clearly very cognizant that we're aware of our margins and we're not going to overinvest too quickly. So we'll invest when it pays for itself. Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : And then another thing that you've talked about is expanding the product menu through in-sourcing and whatnot. Just curious how we should think about that over time. Is that something you're looking to do near term? Or are you trying to maximize your current content initially? Charles R. Kummeth: Well, we're going to stay focused on our core, what we know how to do. We launched over 2,000 products last year, and I'm not saying that's the right number. I think there's a bit of prioritization on some work we're doing here. And I've talked to you and others about [indiscernible] line here about the need for a KOL strategy to be working more and collaborating with the leading edge of technology. And made it current in our field will keep people out there in the industry. We're doing that. So far, this year, we're on track. We roughly spin out about 300 or so products a quarter, and we're about there. We run usually about 50 or so proteins a quarter, and that's kind of where we're at. And I'm looking for more impactful things. As you also know, this is a very interesting field when it comes to product. You don't have $100 million runners or anything, so it's a very dispersed step [ph]. So we're trying to -- I think the strategy is working with KOLs and customers to really find where the leading edge is going, to find where the more impactful, more highly thought molecules will be is where we want to go in that area. And this extends beyond proteins, of course, and the antibodies and the immunoassays. We're doing a lot new things coming up in the assaying kit. I think you'll think they're quite a good thing when we launch later this year, and stay tuned. I think innovation is going to be in the upswing here. I think it has to be for a technology like this to stay a leader. Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : And then just last one on gross margin. You talked about the mix, which I appreciate. But how should we think about margin, gross margin over the next year or so? Do you expect it to stay kind of stable at this point? Or should we expect it to continue to tick down a little bit? Gregory J. Melsen: It will probably remain about at the adjusted level, Amanda. About 2% of the impact was related to Bionostics, a little bit of medical devices tax impacts. So the adjusted margin should be about there. There could be some deceleration of the add-back and charge from the step-ups. But on an adjusted basis, it should remain about the same. Operator : Our next question comes from Dan Leonard of Leerink Swann. Justin Bowers - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division : And this is Justin on for Dan. So just wanted to follow up on APAC. That was really strong in the quarter. And I know that you guys have made some investments over there. And I was just curious if you think that rate of growth is sustainable. Charles R. Kummeth: I think it is. But again, it's a 6% base for us right now. So being small, we should be able to improve by adding sales force. We've been a very conservative company in the past, and we're trying to get to know more of the game here. How far that goes? I don't know. I'm hoping it won't drop back to the 20s. But saying we're going to be over the 50s going forward is something that's too hard to say at this point, it's 1 quarter. But we're very happy with 38% in China and 14% Pac Rim. That's right on track for what I kind of wanted in light of the additions that we made. Justin Bowers - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division : And OpEx, that came in better than what we've been looking for as well. And maybe your thoughts on the sustainability of kind of that and kind of juxtaposed with the pacing and potential impact of those OEM and partnership initiatives you mentioned. Charles R. Kummeth: I'm not sure I get you. I think in terms of our OEM relationships going forward? Justin Bowers - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division : Yes. So I guess, maybe like what we should look for in terms of timing about some of those relationships, and then where we might see the impact of that, whether it shows up in gross margin or in OpEx or... Gregory J. Melsen: We're really in the early stages of considering those opportunities. So it's difficult for us to comment on the impact. But we view those as other channels of distribution. And so the impact, if any, if we pursue that, would be in gross margins. Charles R. Kummeth: And the other relationships I mentioned, we're really focused on is the KOL, key opinion leader side of things, which will be more about innovation and finding more -- how the impactful products sooner rather than just choosing serendipity or whatever. Operator : Your next question is from Jeff Eliott of Baird. Jeffrey T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Wanted to get on the academic and government segment a little bit more. Obviously, you faced some headwinds from the government shutdown. But can you help us understand how big those headwinds were and maybe talk about the pacing you saw during the fiscal 1Q? And any commentary you could provide on the second quarter would be helpful. Charles R. Kummeth: I'll start, then maybe Greg wants to finish up with this one. We try to put as much color in our remarks as we could. With the dramatic cutbacks in NIH, I mean, it's clear things are going to be about the way they have been. We're only a quarter or 2 away, we hope here, from the comparables year-on-year. So things we thought kind of bottomed out, right, and then the government went to a shutdown. So we know that definitely compounded things for us late in the quarter here. We're not hearing it's going to step it for a grant cycle. There were rumors that it might, but we don't know for sure right now. So as long as the grant cycles aren't affected going forward, we shouldn't be bottomed out. We should be coming out of these comps. Being at that minus 10 or so percent is kind of about where we've been and it's kind of about where we expected. We certainly compensated on all the other industrial side of the house, in pharma and biotech. And it's just come to a point where we've got out a lot ourselves, talk to customers and they're not stocking. They're being very careful with their purchases. They don't know what's coming, so they're being real watchful in their experiments. And they're not overbuying. They're not stocking up. They're holding back. They're being told to cut back. They probably are experimenting with some other lower-priced competitive situations as well, all of the above. But we don't see it get any worse. And hopefully, we'll be developing our strategy. And I think also having the stronger commercial reach by having people in the field is also going to help us with that endeavor as well. Jeffrey T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Can you remind us of your NIH exposure? And also in the past, you talked about perhaps implementing a new pricings initiative. And I'm wondering if you've made progress there that you can share with us today. Charles R. Kummeth: We do not have progress to share today in pricing. But on the consumables side, we'll do what we have to do with pricing on the top and the bottom. And we're in the middle of stratifying our very extensive portfolio right now to figure out where other avenue there is to deal with there. In terms of what we disclose publicly, we're roughly 28% or so, something like that in the U.S. academic. Gregory J. Melsen: Yes. On the biotech, total biotech sales, biotech segment, 12% of that is from the U.S. academics. Jeffrey T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Okay. And then shifting over to the industrial pharma biotech. You did talk about the improvement there. You did mention some of the sequential improvement that you've been seeing. Can you help us understand how much of the improvement that you're seeing is due to easing comps versus how much is really underlying improving fundamentals? Gregory J. Melsen: Well, I think it's a combination of both, but I don't how to separate out the 2 pieces, Jeff. Operator : Your next question is from Paul Knight at Janney Capital. Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division : Historically, you've had a relatively flat level of sequential revenue. Will that be the nature of the business going forward? Or does the acquisition make this a little different seasonality-wise? Gregory J. Melsen: I think you've got 2 factors as you look at Q2, the December quarter versus the September quarter. Historically, there will be a decline. And I think we still expect that in the December quarter, due to seasonality, we've got Thanksgiving and obviously the Christmas and New Year's, right, have impact, especially on the biotech arena, where sales are roughly tied to people that are at the bench. Bionostics will add to that. If you recall, we had probably 10 weeks in the quarter, slightly less than a full quarter. So we'll have a full quarter there, but there is also some seasonality impact there. So a small decline but a little bit of a pickup from Bionostics. Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division : And then on the pharmaceutical side, was that -- can you talk to that market, Chuck, in the quarter? How was just pharma tracking a little better as the quarter wrapped up? Where are we on that margin, excluding the biotechnology discussion? Charles R. Kummeth: I think that's probably on the side we've had some short-term impact here from the extra reach we have commercially. So the biotech/pharma, biopharma. I mean, pharma is still consolidating as an industry. But I think it slowed down. I think there is renewed activity. We're not hearing anything major that's concerning, I think. Looking forward, it's probably a better area for us for growth, like we have this quarter, than the academic side while we look for those issues really both year-on-year. Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division : Yes. And then lastly, in China, is this -- are these sales being targeted to the China Academy of Sciences, the academic network? Or is it also including the private research sector? Charles R. Kummeth: It's all of the above there. We were having dramatic growth there. And I don't have a [indiscernible] here for which is in the lead. But they're all significant, they're all good. There's just a lot of funding available in China. I think the Beijing office being open is not a big impact. I mean, there's something like 100 institutions in Beijing, and we didn't have any presence at all. So there's one tidbit for you. Operator : Your final question will come from Mike Seppelt of Evercore. Michael W. Seppelt - Evercore Wealth Management, LLC: Can you speak to the ChemoCentryx investment and whether or not you plan on continuing to hold that longer term? It's had a fair amount of volatility lately. Charles R. Kummeth: Sure. We thought there might be a question on that one. But we've had this investment for a long time, something like 15 years. And we certainly are hoping that most of the pain [ph] is behind us and we're kind of riding on this. I've been out there visiting Tom, they've been here. We've had renewed a lot of our association. The team is getting tighter again. They have a pipeline of 10 molecules. And we're talking about a couple here, they've gone sideways with a big partner, GSK. I like it to say is that we're very supportive. We like what we hear. We like what we see. We're helping them. There's a lot more you can get off of their website and talking to them. They have a very, very good website and a lot of information on this. But they have a strong pipeline. I think the story is not over there. So we're kind of supportive and we're in a whole situation. Operator : There are no more questions in queue. Gregory J. Melsen: Thank you. Charles R. Kummeth: All right. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference. You may all disconnect.",

Backes - Chief Accounting Officer and Controller Analysts : Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division Jeffrey T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division Steven F. Crowley - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division Operator : Good morning. Welcome to the Techne Corporation earnings conference call for the second quarter of its fiscal year 2014. Hosting the call today is Chuck Kummeth, Chief Executive Officer of Techne Corporation. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to introduce Chuck Kummeth. Charles R. Kummeth: Thank you, Chelsea. Thank you, and welcome to Techne Corporation's second-ever quarterly conference call. Today we will discuss the earnings results for the second quarter and the first 6 months of fiscal 2014 that we released earlier this morning. As stated in this morning's press release, I'm very pleased with the progress that we have made during the past few months in fiscal year-to-date. Changes made in our operations have improved efficiencies in our Biotech segments allowing us to focus more on sales growth. Gross margins have remained strong and expenses are within our plans as we invest in new people, leaders, technologies and regions. While sales growth in the second quarter was less than the first quarter, our progress is steady, and especially considering the difficult market situation in the academic and government sector. You will hear more about this progress as we provide greater detail during this call regarding our recent financial results and strategic progress. Kathy Backes, as the company's Controller, is with me on the call today. Our plan this morning is for Kathy to provide a review of our financial results for the second quarter and first 6 months of fiscal 2014. I will then address several topics and be open to your questions. Kathleen M. Backes: Before discussing the financial details for this quarter, allow me to remind you that some of the statements made during this conference call may be considered forward-looking statements. The company's 10-K for fiscal year 2013 and 10-Q that will be filed for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2013, identifies certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made this morning. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. The 10-K and 10-Q as well as the company's other SEC filings are available through the company or online. During the call, non-GAAP financial measures may be used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. Tables reconciling these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available in the company's press release issued earlier this morning or on the Techne Corporation website at www.techne-corp.com. Sales as reported increased 11.9% to $84 million for the second fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2013. Organic sales increased 0.4% in the quarter. These organic sales exclude $8 million of Bionostics product sales and $643,000 of favorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Adjusted earnings were $27.8 million or $0.75 per share for the second fiscal quarter of 2014, a 2.4% increase over adjusted EPS of $0.74 in the second quarter of fiscal '13. Adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share excluding intangible asset amortization and cost recognized upon the sale of inventory that was written up to fair value as part of acquisition. For the 6 months ended December 31, 2013, sales as reported increased 13.0% to $169.7 million. Organic sales increased 2.8% in the first 6 months of fiscal 2014. These organic sales exclude $14.2 million of Bionostics product sales and $1.3 million of favorable foreign exchange rate fluctuations. The Bionostics acquisition was completed in July 2013. Adjusted earnings were $58.5 million or 115 -- excuse me, $1.58 per share for the first 2 fiscal quarters of 2014, a 7% increase over adjusted EPS of $1.48 in the first 2 fiscal quarters of 2013. Adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share, again, excluding intangible asset amortization, cost recognized upon the sale of inventory that was written up to fair value as part of acquisitions and professional fees related to the Bionostics acquisition. The company operates 2 reportable segments based on the nature of its products. Our largest segment is the Biotechnology segment, a segment that develops, manufactures and sells biotechnology research and diagnostic products worldwide. This segment includes R&D Systems, Biotechnology division, R&D Europe, Tocris, R&D China, BiosPacific and Boston Biochem. The Biotechnology segment sales were $70.6 million for the second fiscal quarter, an increase of 0.4% after adjustments for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and $143.7 million for the 6 months ended December 31, 2013, which is an increase of 2.4% after adjustments for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Our second segment is now called Clinical Controls, a segment previously referred to as the Hematology segment. This segment develops and manufactures controls and calibrators for sales worldwide. The Clinical Controls segment now includes sales made through R&D Systems, Clinical Controls division and Bionostics. Clinical Controls sales were $13.5 million for the second fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2013, and $25.9 million for the 6-month period then ended. The sales growth was 0.5% for the second fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2013, and 7.0% for the 6-month period then ended when sales of Bionostics products are excluded. The difference between the first and second fiscal quarter sales growth rate was mainly the result of the timing of shipments [indiscernible] the beginning and ending of the first fiscal quarter. A couple of comments regarding key Biotechnology segment, customers and geographies may be helpful. About 50% -- 53% of biotech sales are generated in the United States during the 6 months ended December 31, 2013. The 2 biggest U.S. customer groups are the industrial market, which includes pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies of all sizes; and the academic research market. Sales to U.S. industrial pharmaceutical and biotech customers increased by 2.6% in the quarter ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the same period last year. Although this growth rate was lower than achieved in the first fiscal quarter, we have now experienced improving sales from these U.S. customers during each of the past 4 quarters. We expect and hope that these customers will continue their commitment to research investment. Sales to U.S. academic customers declined 4.6% during the quarter ended December 31, 2013, as compared to the same period last year. This decline was substantially smaller than the 8 -- 11.8% decline experienced in the first fiscal quarter despite the disruption caused by the government shutdown during the first half of October 2013. This is the 10th straight quarter of sales declines in this customer segment. As you know, the U.S. academic market is highly dependent on funding from the National Institute of Health. Unfortunately, sequestration moved from a threat towards reality last March 1, requiring 8% cut across the NIH budget, and this funding stress was compounded by the 2-week government shutdown last October. Europe is our other major biotech market. About 29% of our biotech sales were derived from this continent during the 6 months ended December 31, 2013. Like the U.S., the major customer groups in Europe are the academic market and pharma and biotech companies. Sales in Europe, excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, showed a decline of 2.0% in the second quarter of 2014, after 1.5% of organic growth in the first fiscal quarter. Our European sales for the first 6 months of fiscal 2014 are basically flat, which is consistent with our fiscal 2013 European results, but better than the organic sales declines reported in each quarter of fiscal 2012. European academic sales were slightly down during the second fiscal quarter with a sales to biotech and pharma customers being relatively flat during the 3 months ended December 31, 2013. Germany again showed sales growth in the second fiscal quarter while slight sales declines were experienced in the U.K. and France during this period. Sales in China increased by almost 32% in the quarter ended December 31, 2013, as compared to the same period last year, and excluding the benefit of a slightly stronger Chinese currency. Our China presence has been growing at about 20% or more for each year since we established an operation there in fiscal 2006. This growth improved dramatically in the most recent 2 fiscal quarters due to an expanded sales staff and a relatively small base of business. China generated about 6% of consolidated sales during the first half of fiscal 2014. Although this is relatively small, a China presence is important to our strategy of global reach and growth. Pacific Rim sales increased by 7.5% in the quarter ended December 31, 2013, as compared to the same period last year, and increased 10.5% during the first 6 months of fiscal 2014. The strength during the last 6 months is due to its comparison against weak first 2 fiscal quarters in fiscal 2013 and the emphasis we are placing on Asian sales growth. About 10% of our biotech sales were generated in the Pacific Rim during the first 6 months of fiscal 2014 solely through our distributor partners. Japan, Korea and Taiwan are the leading countries in this geography. Gross margins adjusted for cost recognized upon the sale of the part of the inventory and amortization of intangibles were 72.7% and 76.2% for the quarters ended December 31, 2013, and 2012, respectively. The decrease in adjusted gross margins for the quarter was primarily caused by a change in product mix from higher-margin biotechnology segment sales to Clinical Controls segment sales as a write-off -- as the result of the Bionostics acquisition. The impact of the medical device excise tax also slightly reduced gross margin profit. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter ended December 31, 2013, increased $4.0 million from the quarter ended December 31, 2012. This is similar to the level of expense increase reported in the previous quarter. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter included $1 million of selling, general and administrative expenses related to Bionostics operations; a $1.1 million increase in intangible asset amortization, primarily related to the Bionostics acquisition; and a $541,000 increase in noncash stock option -- stock compensation expense as compared to the same quarter last year. The remaining increase in selling, general and administrative expense for the quarter ended December 31, 2013, was mainly the result of increased executive compensation and additional sales staff added since the start of fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $7.7 million during the 6 months ended December 31, 2013, versus the same period in the prior fiscal year. This increase in selling, general and administrative expenses include a $2.1 million of selling, general and administrative expense related to Bionostics operations following its July acquisition; a $1.5 million increase in intangible asset amortization primarily related to the Bionostics acquisition; $532,000 professional fees related to the Bionostics acquisition; and an $807,000 increase in our cash stock compensation expense as compared to the same 6-month period last year. The remaining increase in selling, general and administrative expense for the 6 months ended December 31, 2013, was mainly the result of increased executive compensation and additional sales staff added since the start of fourth quarter of 2013. Research and development expenses increased $520,000 or 7.3% for the quarter ended December 31, 2013, and $770,000 or 5.2% for the 6-month period ended December 31, 2013, versus the comparable period in the prior fiscal year. The increases are due to research and development expenses related to Bionostics operations and increase of personnel and prior costs associated with the continued development and release of new high-quality biotech products. The effective tax rate for both the quarter and 6 months ended December 31, 2013, were 30.8%, compared to 32.3% for the same prior year period. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily the result of decreased tax rates in the U.K. and the increased percentage of pretax income from foreign operations, which have lower income tax rates than the U.S. The company expects the income tax rate for the remainder of fiscal 2014 to range between 30% and 32%. I'll conclude today's financial discussion with a few balance sheet and cash flow comments. At December 31, 2013, Techne had $349 million of cash and available-for-sale investments, which is up $26 million from September 30, 2013, and we continue to have no debt. We generated $31.3 million from operations in the quarter ended December 31, 2013, and $53.9 million from operations during the 6-month period then ended. The 6-month cash generation is 5.5% more [indiscernible] generated in the same 6-month period last year. During the second fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2013, we returned $11.4 million to our shareholders in the form of dividends, and $3.6 million was invested in capital expenditures. Noncash stock-based compensation expense was $1.3 million. This is an increase over the $569,000 of stock-based compensation expense in the previous quarter due to options granted through our Board of Directors upon their reelection at our October Annual Meeting. I will now turn the program back to Chuck Kummeth for his additional comments and observations. Charles R. Kummeth: Thank you, Kathy. I'd like to add a few supplemental comments regarding our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2014 in the markets we serve. I'll also make a few comments regarding our product offerings and a couple regarding the progress we are making with our strategic plan. Our results for the quarter and 6-month period that ended December 31 supports the belief that our customers are facing a number of stresses, particularly in the U.S. academic market. This customer segment is now down to 12% of our consolidated Biotech segment sales. While we've endured over 2 years of sales declines and uncertainty in this customer segment, we are approaching the anniversary date of sequestration. This should make our comparative results a bit easier. We cannot wait for the markets to strengthen. We need do more. The Fisher Scientific distribution agreement that was announced last Friday as one of our strategies to gain deeper penetration into the academic market. Fisher agreement is for 3 years and allows us to leverage Fisher Scientific distribution channels in the United States and Canada. Fisher Scientific is a premier customer channel brand with internal Fisher Scientific and has a leading position in the life sciences market. We believe Fisher Scientific's broad customer reach and proven record of customer service and support will help accelerate our sales growth. As preferred supplier, we will be able to leverage the commercial strength of the Fisher Scientific channel through its large sales force and highly trained life science application specialists. Additionally we will be well positioned to take advantage of the many Fisher Scientific marketing programs including advanced e-commerce solutions that will occupy a promising [ph] division of Fisher Scientific catalog. We will continue to market and provide technical support for our existing customers, as well as all new customers introduced through the extensive Fisher Scientific channel. The partnership will expose our products with greater number of academic, governmental and industrial customers, including those in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and serial [ph] segments. I also remain encouraged by our strong brand and segment position and believe we have tremendous upside potential. Our strong brand name has created a business with longevity value. We are a leader in the field of cytokines, growth factors and related [indiscernible] in Clinical Controls. We have a large portfolio of products that is continuously being enhanced with new product introductions, and we are heightening our focus with value-added products and are focusing less in providing raw materials to our competitors. The new long-term outlook remains favorable. Today we have increased our focus on channel direct selling and are being price competitive without seeing a substantial impact on our gross margins. We believe these actions can translate into incremental revenue. We are also likely to benefit from the trend of RUO [ph] products being converted into diagnostic tools, and the adoption of our products on various testing platforms will also allow us to leverage our unique content. I also believe there's potential M&A activity that can provide additional growth. We do not lack for opportunities and have a strong balance sheet that provides us with the ability to leverage. This puts us in a strong position to target deals that verifies this. The trick is finding targets that will scale our business and take us into new markets. Our goal is to build on Techne's history of product and financial success and to execute a strategy which prepares us for the changing market landscape. Innovation in core products, acquisitions and expansion of our geographic footprint will be key to successfully achieving our strategy. These goals will additionally benefit from a newly creative key opinion leader network that will strengthen our collaborative science [ph] which can translate into new products. In recognition of the expected increase, size and scale of the organization, we will need to redesign our development and operational and commercial resources to create greater efficiencies in the organization. We will also need to retain our talented staff and recruit supplemental personnel as necessary to allow us to successfully implement the strategic vision we have for our company. My conclusion is the same as it was 3 months ago. Techne is an outstanding company that will continue to focus on operating discipline and the balance sheet and cash flow management needed to fund our growth and to continue to return cash to shareholders as appropriate. We'll also be continuing strengthening our growth program with selective discipline acquisitions that will enhance our sales growth rate. Our second quarter results reflect that we are successful in beginning to implement our strategic plans to accelerate sales growth while at the same time maintaining superb gross margins, controlling expenses and generating substantial cash flow. We'll now turn the program back to our moderator and entertain your questions and comments. Chelsea? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Amanda with William Blair. Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : I just had a question on the Thermo Fisher, the Fisher Scientific distribution agreement. Could you just talk a little bit about how those economics work to the extent that you're able to share? And then also in context of that agreement, how you're thinking about sales force in North America for Techne internally? Charles R. Kummeth: Sure. Well, as you know, Amanda, we had nothing more than inside sales group when I arrived. Now we have an army of 5 individuals in the key markets that are very technically oriented and can help create demand and drive local growth in these mostly larger accounts, as well as prospecting as needed. But aside from that, it's nice to have a little more channel support. Now we do have some sales third-party through [indiscernible] Fisher always have, but the opportunity is there and has been there to leverage similar what they do with BD. And they have pretty large force of technical sales specialists that know our model already because of the BD arrangement. And you know how well how neutral Fisher is. This leverages an army of over 1,000 reps and in what's called a platinum-level arrangement. We're the top tier category for commission, so we'll -- they'll be out there trying to really do more for us. The arrangements are very sound. I can tell you at the past present that Thermo, they're better than any deal I had internally. They're very good. Thermo wants content and of a life tech deal they just did obviously proves that. And so they've been really after more product classes like we have and are coming for years. And they're really -- it's a high priority for them. Clearly with the consumables and instrumentation, they can surround the customer with everything but content, and that content is a very big strategy for them, so we were able to find very, very good terms, and I'm just hoping for a lot of incremental growth. I won't give you the specifics, but I will tell you that they are largely paid on incremental growth, not on just pure -- on your channel thought that we currently -- with our current means of how we're delivering a customer. So it's a very good win-win situation both ways and it's pretty known [ph] for 3 years, and I'm hoping for some incremental success from them. I don't think it's a double the business or anything, but I'm expecting a couple of percent of this and hopefully for the quarter if we can get, but it's really unknown right now. We're just large at sales force, it all comes down to which was the same as when I was at Fisher, it depends on how much they go after it and how they're treated within the structure of their current arenas because they supply like a million products. So it's complicated. But they're everywhere, so we're expecting good things. In terms of our sales force, we're making great progress. They are definitely delivering, and it is going quite well. We are very excited. People now are looking for one more in an another region, but we're seeing great results. As you know, we hired experienced people that could hit the ground running right away, and they're delivering really within this first month. As they learn the company culture and our pretty big products, that it gets even better, but I'm very, very encouraged by what we're seeing. And I think it's also helping offset other erosion, especially in this academic sector we talked about, which is still there and will probably remain there for another one more quarter to go here probably. If you want, you can have a follow-up question if you like, Amanda, if it didn't cover, we can continue if you like? Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : Okay. My follow-up was China. So you had talked previously about branding strategies there, curious if there's any updates on that front? Charles R. Kummeth: Yes, we had another, as you saw, very, very strong quarter in China. We're now at year-to-date roughly 35% growth. It is interesting place as you know. We have probably a little more than doubled our employee count there, and things are going quite well. We have the office opening in Beijing with a big success. We have some extraordinary talent that we have found in China. I'm just really, really impressed, been working China for many years, in much bigger organizations. So it's very hopeful. With that all said, we've got to do more. We've got to get more local. We've got to get local brand identified, and we're very close to many of these things. And so they're all work in progress and these reports and us [ph] is probably assuming more than that. But right now we're kind of riding a good growth wave there. It's probably lower hanging fruit. As I mentioned in the past, it's a lower base for us, but now it's 6%, but if it keeps at this rate, it won't stay small for long, so... Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff with Robert Baird. Jeffrey T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : My first question is on operating margin. Obviously I get the mix shift here, but can you talk through -- was 47% the level that you expected? And how should we think about the margin going forward? Charles R. Kummeth: The big shift in gross margin was generated [ph] by Bionostics. The rest of it from there is really coming from different -- the way we run our business, and actually we're well within our expense levels we expected to be. We're actually under planned to be honest. So we're fine there in that mix. We have actually had a slight increase in our gross margin, and our biotechs have [indiscernible]. I've talked in the past about our operations redesign. And that's allowed us to have a portion of the business, the company are focused on productivity like a factory model that should, there have never been here before. And that's yielded some early results. We have some new arrangements with FedEx. We have a lot of efficiency programs in place, some lean programs in place, and there is substantial costing, about $1 million or so year-to-date here, which is improving the gross margins in that part of the segment. So if you ask about the rate we should be at, we'd be a little higher with the extra volume if we had to add it [ph] probably, but that's all coming. So I think you have to look at it more in a 6-month level than the quarter-by-quarter. Jeffrey T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Got it. Okay. Charles R. Kummeth: And also I should make one comment too on stock option expense for the director for your seasonal. So this is the quarter that hit, it might have some impact. Jeffrey T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Got it. So it sounds like that we could see a small step up in the second half of the fiscal year? Charles R. Kummeth: We should. Jeffrey T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Okay. And then just on the organic revenue growth, can you talk about what kind of pacing you saw during the quarter? I get we had the government shutdown. Did you see a step off during the shutdown and kind of a recovery afterwards? Or what did it look like during the quarter? And then you talked about seeing a recovery during the current quarter, can you talk about what you're seeing there now? Charles R. Kummeth: As you know, the shutdown was October, so it was kind of off pace right away from the very beginning of the quarter, and I really don't think we ever really fully caught up, to be honest. And then the holiday season was a weird year, right, with a Wednesday, so we knew we were going to take really a couple of day hit on that. So I don't think -- all in all, we probably should have forecasted maybe a little better on those on the holiday situation, but the shutdown definitely hurt us some. We'll see. Still, growth, given the things we saw and the pressures I've seen, I think there's still upside in the near 3% 6-month rate. We're probably within the area of our range where I see for moving the model here so. If -- we should -- with Fisher, with the things we're putting in place and all the things I've talked to you guys all off-line and stuff on it, it should be slowly improving. I've never we should ever get really above mid-level single-digit growth in the quarter here organically until we get new platforms and extensions and adjacent markets we've talked about and other things. So it's early days here, but staying in the positive territory, especially in this hopefully the last season of the sequestration, I think is a good thing. Operator : Our next question comes from Dan with Leerink. Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division : I've had some technical difficulty, so if I'm asking a question that's been asked before, I apologize. But Chuck, a follow-up on Amanda's earlier question on the Fisher agreement. What does this mean for incremental margin? So as the deal is structured to over and above prior sales to given Customer A, does Fisher take 30% of that? And thus far -- and thus your incremental gross margins are going to be meaningfully lower? Charles R. Kummeth: I want to be careful how I answer this because one, we're not banking everything on Fisher. We have other channels as well as other partners. I can tell you that the terms are very favorable. Nobody sells completely at list anyway, even us, and so there's definitely room, and the margin loss is very acceptable and nearly immaterial really unless there's some major surprise. We've been promoting and discounting heavily since, I think, this company has never done it. We've talked about the low-end of the portfolio here and our rising competition, especially at the easier to make money [ph] level products. So we've been promoting and you still haven't seen much material difference with our numbers. It will be likely the same, unless these guys blow it out of the water. I mean if they come in and it's something 10% or above percent growth off of that, then there may be some move, but I would take that trade-off in that kind of growth. But in our model of what we think we see likely for incremental growth shouldn't be that big a deal. Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division : Okay. And my follow-up. How does this coexist? Or how are you able to negotiate a coexistence between your product portfolio and what Thermo has now brought on board from Life, who offers a number of the same products? Charles R. Kummeth: Great question. I guess you just have to be an ex-Thermo person to fully, really understand the neutrality of Fisher. Fisher is neutral. They stand for convenience and choice for their customers. And to the great frustration of every division president within Thermo Fisher Scientific, they're a partner but also it's a complicated situation. It's that they're channel of choice, but they also realize that they have to compete for that channel like with other competitors. As an example, when I ran in LG non [ph] in the lab consumer [ph] for Thermo, I had to compete against Corning [ph] with my own channel. It's actually quite healthy, and it works quite well, and there are numbers to prove it right at Thermo. So it's a very successful model. I know it very well, and I know that we can trust this bunch and they'll be very good to us, and it's all about being platinum level and being a good partner and working with them and supporting the products with the technical backup and creating the demand as they work with you. And Life Check [ph] will have to earn their place like every other part within Thermo Fisher Scientific. There may be some people who are actually waking up there asking us and like [ph] and wondering what's happened. But they'll soon realize just how important Fisher is and how neutral it is, and you have to earn the right to get them playing ball on your side. Did that help? Operator : We have another question from Jeff with Robert Baird. Jeffrey T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : My question is on Bionostics. Can you talk about the how the integration is going? And what kind of synergies you've been able to achieve on that? Charles R. Kummeth: Sure. Large part is it's never a ton of synergy to be expected. It's an OEM model. It's an extension of platform comprised of -- related to ours, same company but different products. So in terms of synergies, their synergy is in some of the functional heads and different things like that, but there isn't -- not at all sales force per se and things like that to worry about. So I guess on that, we're okay. On the growth side, I think we're just a little bit less than where I'd like to have been. But it's within the range of our model. We're very, very happy with the leadership there and the overall integration into our company and within -- in the systems, et cetera, for that part of the integration. It's not a difficult acquisition to integrate. It's just largely a bolt-on and incremental. And the people there are good. The locations are wonderful to work at. And we have -- they were -- it was PE owned before, and the leader there, the CEO was grooming the person for years there to take over, and that person is in charge for us, and it's going quite well. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven with Craig-Hallum. Steven F. Crowley - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division : In terms of a couple of questions that haven't been asked, in terms of what you're doing in Europe with your direct operations with roots efforts and with your indirect initiatives through J.P., can you update us on what you've tried to do there? And whether or not you think we've started to see some of the benefits of those actions? Charles R. Kummeth: In Europe? Steven F. Crowley - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division : In Europe and then also international with J.P.? Charles R. Kummeth: Oh, I see what you're saying, okay. Well, Europe is the one place where we do have a true commercial model. We have roughly 20-some different reps. We are -- probably our longer term strategy will to be to work a little closer and pick up some of the distributors that we're working with, like we have in the past with Germany where we are direct. We're mostly run out in the U.K. as you know and 100-plus employees overall. And it's kind of up, it's kind of down. It's definitely in a slightly positive territory year-to-date here, and we are all banking on it and hearing about the winds are back in the sails in Europe, this maybe a decent year there, so we're expecting to ride that as well. So we're a little better than flat. It's rising slowly, so it's working, but it's through normal commercial kind of operations. There isn't any really sort of bolt-on coverage like we're trying to pull off here in the U.S. but with added coverage in the major regions as an example. In Asia, with J.P. there in our managed distribution, that's actually going quite well, and he is busy working on, I would say, streamlining our distributor partners. We had lots of channel conflicts. We had in some countries too many distributors fighting each other. There were lots of things to work on. We are down to a distinct strategy now and in some cases singular dedicated distributors in smaller territories. We are looking at going even direct in some other areas like Australia is an example, which pretty -- everybody does. It's just too far away to manage distributors. It has been for most companies. India is going quite well. Korea is going extremely well. Japan, we're having a great year. So we have multiple distributors in Japan, as you know, you kind of have to. You've got a very extensive dealer network that have their loyalties you have to deal with there in almost every market class, and we're working that well. J.P. being a 20-plus year veteran in Asia is driving that hard, and we're working on some new plans and contracts with these people to give them more what they want and what we want in terms of support and growth and so they will invest more. That's why you see the numbers picking up. And again, I don't think it will be dramatic overnight. These are still kind of small markets country by country, except for Japan, and it'll take a combined effort of all this together holistically to try and move the needle, which I think we will, and our strategic plan has over the next 5 years more about doubling with a potential of sales in APAC overall, including China. So I think we're on track for that. China has to stay above 30 in the year-on-year, which hopefully we can, and so far so good. APAC is one of the better stories here so far in my early tenure here in the company. Steven F. Crowley - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division : Great. And then a follow-up, Chuck, can you hear me? I'm not sure that I'm muted or live? Charles R. Kummeth: I can hear you fine. Steven F. Crowley - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division : Okay. In terms of the success you are pointing to with your commercial sales people in the field in the U.S., has that success so far been driven more by getting deeper into key accounts and better penetrating those full accounts? Or really better covering the whole ecosystem? All their customers around the key accounts, feeder accounts? So far, what's happened, and what do you think happens from here? Charles R. Kummeth: I think a little all of the above. Let me explain a little bit. Also you get back to -- essentially we're hiring these rock stars with lots of experience that it kind of depends a little bit on what they're like and their relationships, and so it varies a little bit. Some of them are little better at prospecting, some are really good at high-level key account whale hunters, bigger deals pulling in orders of a couple of $100,000 or more. We have a little of all of the above. The original design was to take these inside sales people that are being worked to death here locally with $18 million account representation and try and get a partner out there in the major markets to work with. And that's been working quite well. So we've divided these territories between the inside professional here with that external person, and it's a combination of breaking up the relationship from major accounts to where they both have been -- where they have these relationships established, and then allowing the local person to really do the prospecting portion of the workload, okay, and working hand in hand with support back here with the inside person, all right? And it's working fairly well. I think we're actually maybe short. I think we're looking for a second person in the Bay Area, and we may look for one in Houston. We may expand in Boston. As I've said, I don't see us ever going above 10 or 12 for this model. I think it's fine. We have to supplement all of this, of course, with an even better website, which we're working on. There has to be very, very quick and good access to products with these many, many customers for this model to work, which is why we did the Fisher agreement is for increased accessibility and why we're going to work on the website so that we can provide that transaction capability with fewer clicks. I will also mention a big plus for the Fisher agreement too. It's just how our model works. We're not a very large company, and we're working, as we told you, on our website. Our level of e-commerce here is roughly 1/3 and most companies like ours, you'll find all of them the same way. When you begin with customers, almost nearly one professor, one researcher at a time. There's a lot of phone and fax and papers still involved in our operations. A lot of these institutions, both industrial and academic, the accessibility and the ease of making a transaction or purchase can vary, and having local lab stock online with systems like Fisher provides can provide for a lot of incremental ease. So we want to make it easy. It's called a punch out. We want to make it easy for the local researcher to -- if they don't have the time to -- the old way of picking up the catalogs and figuring out what to buy and make the phone call to order their favorite cytokine from us, they can just now order through the punch out on the online lab stock system, push the big blue Fisher button. It's going to -- it should make it much easier to do. That's what we're counting on. And it's all about accessibility. And the fewer clicks, the better. But we've got to get away from paper and fax and phone if we can here, and that's one of our initiatives here and it's progressing. Operator : There are no further questions in queue. [Operator Instructions] Charles R. Kummeth: While you guys are thinking, I want to follow-up on one of the questions about Europe. I will tell you that our -- Germany does remain very strong. U.K. and France are a little bit weaker. The academic areas are still this soft. We have still a large pharma issue in Europe. As you know, it's been moving out. Growth in terms of small and midsized pharma and biotech customers, and it's more the midsized levels in Germany is really in the package [ph] in terms of our success, and I think that kind of nears what I read in what's going on over there. Let's just hope it all continues, and U.K. can follow soon. So far so good. It's so far much better year-on-year, and I expect they will continue to be... Operator : We have another question from Steven with Craig-Hallum. Steven F. Crowley - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division : Just one follow-up question. I think I heard in the financial discussion either from Chuck or Kathy that you said on an apples-to-apples basis, biotech gross margin was actually up. Are you referencing from a year ago period on an adjusted basis from Q1 period? I guess there's a fundamental question of did I hear you correctly? But maybe you could flesh that out just a little bit more for us? Charles R. Kummeth: That would be both, year-over-year and quarter-on-quarter. It's not a big move. But it's -- we're roughly $1 million or $2 million off in the volume that we wanted to have in expectations and it would flow to the bottom line. I think that's where -- any initial adjustment would be. And yet we held really well and that is because the biotech segment was up in gross margins because of about $1 million in savings on different truncated programs, the FedEx deal we did and some other things. And so that's been a little bit helpful, but that's good that we're -- We have to do this. I'm a Six-Sigma-trained kind of guy. And as you invest for growth, you have to also do what you can on the savings side, and there are a lot of efficiencies to be done here, which we're working on. And Kathy may have something to add here as well. Kathleen M. Backes: Right. Regarding the biotech segment, yes, the margins for the quarter and the 6 months were slightly up from prior years, and I believe also from first quarter. But again, they were just slightly. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul with Janney Montgomery. Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division : I guess the answer on the operating margin impacts from the Thermo relationship is that it's unclear at this point. I mean my question -- my concern would be, will customers bounce around on the 2 websites and price shop? I mean, what's to prevent that? Charles R. Kummeth: It's almost nearly the same. Unless they really blow up their numbers on huge growth, there will be no noticeable change in terms of our margin to this. It's my prediction. That's our model. Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division : And your... Charles R. Kummeth: And again, you got to realize that we've structured a deal that gives them what they want in terms of content, and we're not after just channel swap, right? So we're after incremental growth, and they're really incentivized on true growth. And this is a much different model than us shipping a lot of goods and going into their giant, automated-driven warehousing. We don't see a real report of where things were going to what customers. We're shipping everything to customers from here, so we know where it's all going. We'll know what's due to us, what's due to them. So we're able to really, really well manage the scorecard of what they're contributing to this model and how that compensation occurred. And it's largely based on incremental growth. If -- like I said before, if there's a material shift in growth from this, which I don't expect, then there may be a noticeable decrease in real margin overall. But again, we're -- at the level where we're at, it's a tradeoff I'd love to have, to be honest, for that kind of growth. Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division : Do you think incremental margins in the future will be at 48% or higher -- kind of your current level or higher, if you had incremental growth above this current level of organic? Charles R. Kummeth: Probably in that range. I'd say it's not far off the mark. It's hard to know. We're adding a lot of new things here too and looking at new areas, and as I stated repeatedly, staying north of the 50% operating margins and trying to grow back at levels we need to grow is virtually impossible. Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division : Yes. And then the other question was the cash per share, I think you said $3.49. On that long-term asset on the balance sheet, is that cash or is that ChemoCentryx? And then what's going to happen with ChemoCentryx? Kathleen M. Backes: ChemoCentryx is in a short-term available-for-sale investment number. The remainder of the available-for-sale are all mostly municipal bonds that are liquid, but just had a longer dating [ph]. Charles R. Kummeth: And in terms of the future of ChemoCentryx is we're a closer partner than we have been in the previous few years. We've been with them a long time, as you know. They've had some bumps in the road. They had some positive bumps recently, and things are bouncing back. We're very bullish on ChemoCentryx with their pipeline of 8 different molecules, any one of those hits, and this is going to be a great story for them and for us with our position. After being involved for over 15 years together, I mean the pains are mostly behind us. I don't see any reason to not just be supportive and ride this and see where it goes. We're very supportive. I think we're very -- I think we see success. I don't think it's this year or next year. It could be 2 to 3 years, but I -- we believe in what they're doing and it's cool stuff, I think. We don't need the cash for anything desperate enough for this anyways, so it's a good story, I think. Operator : There are no further questions in queue. [Operator Instructions] Charles R. Kummeth: We'll give it a minute here. We have 5 more minutes, but if not, we'll start winding up here. Again, summing, it's a reasonable quarter for us, we feel. We're moving a lot of parts here, changing a lot of things that were well under plan in our expenses. Our margins are really exactly we expect them to be. They'd be a little better here if we had the extra little bit of volume we thought we might get, but we're in the range of what I thought and we told all of you. It's not a short-term gain here, and we're looking to the long term. We're investing for long term, and that's the way we intend to be and to be more strategic. And anyway, thank you for calling in, listening and asking your questions. And this is #2. I promise to be back for a #3 in another quarter. Thank you.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Techne Corporation's Earnings Conference call for its fiscal year third quarter 2014. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jim Hippel, Chief Financial Officer. James Hippel : Good morning, and thank you all for joining us as we discuss the results of our third quarter. With me this morning is Chuck Kummeth, Chief Executive Officer of Techne Corporation. But before we begin, let me briefly cover our Safe Harbor statement. Some of the remarks made during this conference call may be considered forward-looking statements. The company's 10-K for fiscal year 2013 and the 10-Q that will be filed for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2014 identify certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made during this call. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of any new information or future events or developments. The 10-K and 10-Q, as well as the company's other SEC filings, are available on the company's website within its Investor Relations section. During the call, non-GAAP financial measures may be used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. Tables reconciling these measures to most comparable GAAP measures are available in the company's press release issued earlier this morning or on the Techne Corporation website at www.techne-corp.com.  So with that, I will turn the call over to Chuck. Charles Kummeth : Thanks. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for our Q3 call. As stated in this morning's press release, I'm extremely pleased with the results for the quarter and the progress we've made year-to-date. Our team has executed very well, matching the overall organic growth rates we saw back in Q1. The U.S. held up well despite some severe weather conditions in the quarter and despite the continued spending pressure in the academic market.  Europe's growth was just outstanding at near 8%. The Pac Rim continues to be strong in low-double digit. And while China struggled with some tough comps in January, they finished the quarter with strong growth rates. I'm still expecting China to end the year near 30% growth, coming off the strong commercial investments we made.  Gross margins have remained solid, and expenses are within our plan as we continue to invest in new people, leaders, systems and technologies. We continue to execute on our strategy of delivering innovative core products to customers, over 1,300 year-to-date, and in expanding geographies. Our progress and results in Q3 and year-to-date, while a great improvement over last year, are closer to the beginning of this journey than to the end.  Now I would like to introduce our new CFO, Jim Hippel, who started with the company on the 1st of April. He is on the call with me today, as he mentioned starting out, and will provide a review of our financial results for the third quarter. I will then address several recent events and then open to your questions.  Jim, I turn it over to you. James Hippel : Thanks, Chuck. It's great to be here. And again, good morning, everyone. I'll begin with an overview of our Q3 and year-to-date financial performance for the total company, followed by some color on each of our 2 segments.  So starting with the overall financial performance. We delivered a solid third quarter, with adjusted earnings of $34.7 million, or $0.94 per diluted share. That's a 6.9% increase over adjusted EPS of $0.88 in the third fiscal quarter of 2013. This brings our Q3 year-to-date adjusted earnings to 92.2 -- $92.9 million, or $2.51 per diluted share, an increase of 5.8% from the prior fiscal year-to-date period.  As detailed in our press release, adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share, exclude acquisition-related costs, these are costs such as intangible asset amortization, costs recognized upon the sale of inventory that was written up to fair value and professional fees related to ongoing acquisition activity. Also excluded are prior year tax research credits that expired December 31, 2013, as well as the prior year reduction in U.S. taxes that changes the estimates related to foreign source income.  On the top line, Q3 total revenue was $95.6 million, an increase of 18% year-over-year, and we delivered 5% organic growth. Q3 reported revenue include 11.5% growth from our acquisition of Bionostics back in July and about a 1% impact from foreign exchange.  On a year-to-date basis, revenue now stands at $265.2 million, an increase of 15% year-over-year, with nearly 4% of that coming from organic growth.  Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin came in at 73.6% in the current quarter. That's down by about 410 basis points from the prior year due to mix changes associated with the acquisition of Bionostics last July. Excluding Bionostics, gross margins were essentially flat to last year.  SG&A in Q3 was 15.3% of revenue, 300 basis points more than 2013 quarter. Approximately 1/3 of this basis point increase is associated with the acquisition of Bionostics. The remaining 2/3 of the increase is a result of commercial and leadership investments made earlier in the year.  Finally, R&D expense came in at 8% of revenue for the quarter, that's 90 basis points below the prior year. Additional R&D spend resulting from the Bionostics acquisition, as well as some other development projects, was more than offset by the volume leverage seen from higher sales.  Turning to cash flow on the balance sheet. The headline numbers for Q3 are $34.9 million in cash generated from operations for the quarter and $371 million of cash and available-for-sale investments at quarter end. We continue to have no debt.  During Q3, we invested $4.3 million in capital expenditures and returned $11.4 million to our shareholders in the form of dividends.  That wraps up my comments on the total company. Now I'll walk you through the revenue performance of our 2 business segments.  Starting with the Biotechnology segment. As a reminder, this is the larger of our 2 segments, which develops, manufactures and sells biotechnology research and diagnostic products worldwide. It sells products under the R&D Systems, Tocris, Boston Biochem and BiosPacific brands. The Biotechnology segment reported $80.1 million of revenue and 5% organic growth in Q3. About 53% of biotech sales were generated in the United States during the first 9 months of this fiscal year. Within the U.S, the 2 biggest U.S. customer groups for biotech are the industrial market, which includes pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies of all sizes, and the economic research market. Sales to U.S. industrial customers in biotech grew 4% in Q3. This is consistent with the year-to-date performance and it's the fifth quarter in a row of improving sales.  Sales to U.S. academic customers declined 12% in Q3 compared to last year. This decline is consistent with what we've seen for a couple of years. And as is widely known, the U.S. academic market is highly dependent on funding from the National Institute of Health, whose budget was drastically cut well over a year ago. Sales to U.S. academic customers now only comprise 12% of biotech's total revenue.  Europe is our other major biotech market. About 29% of our biotech sales were derived in this region so far this year. Like the U.S., the major customer groups in Europe are the academic market and the industrial market, which include pharma and biotech companies. Sales in Europe rebounded from Q2, reporting a healthy 8% organic growth in Q3. Regionally within Europe, Germany posted a strong 20% organic growth. France was solid, with mid-single digit organic growth, and the U.K. experienced low-single digit organic growth.  The industrial customer group led the growth in Europe, posting organic growth rates in the mid-teens, while academic customers grew modestly in the low single digits.  Moving on to biotech sales in China. China experienced an expected tough comparable in the month of January, which limited their organic growth rate to 2% for Q3. However, the China team was essentially on their internal target for the quarter and experienced growth rates in February, March that were more comparable with Q2. China is an integral part of the company's growth strategy. And with the investments we made earlier in the year by expanding our sales staff, we expect future growth rates to increase beyond the 20% annual growth rate we'd experienced since we establish operations there in the fiscal year 2006.  Generating an approximately 10% of the Biotechnology segment's revenue, Pacific Rim is another strategically important region for the company, where organic sales increased by 12% in Q3. Here, increased management focus and distributor collaboration in the region are paying off. The leading countries in this region are Japan, Korea and Taiwan.  Now switching gears to our other segment, Clinical Controls. As a reminder, this segment develops and manufactures controls and calibrators for sale worldwide. It sells products under the R&D Systems and Bionostics brand. The Clinical Controls segment reported $15.4 million of revenue and 7% organic growth in Q3. Organic growth here excludes revenue from Bionostics, subsequent to the acquisition. The increase is driven by strong demand for its products and solid execution of the team.  So with that, I will turn the call back over to Chuck for some additional comments. Charles Kummeth : Thanks, Jim. I'd like to add a few supplemental comments regarding our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2014 in the markets we serve. I will also make a few comments regarding our commercial and investment activity and a couple regarding the progress we are making with our strategic plan. I want to give you an update on the Fisher collaboration we began about a quarter ago. While still early and difficult to quantify the impact of the Fisher arrangement on some of our good results this quarter, we are confident we had some lift due to this. The teams are working well together. We have succeeded in linking our systems, and customers are reacting positively to the collaboration. I fully expect our growth to improve through this arrangement and view this as a win-win for both companies. Fisher benefits from this relationship because, when they lead in an account with high-value content like R&D Systems, they have the opportunity to dialogue with senior people in the labs and pull through many other product lines. We also continued to expand our cable network under the leadership of our new CTO, Dr. Fernando Bazan. We are focusing on areas in stem cell, cancer, immunology, enzymatics, disease biology and many others. Very encouraging that we have over 40 researchers all globally well-known in their fields collaborating with our scientists now. This is important for long-term organic growth since it is the key to innovation our business and very typical in the industry.  Two weeks ago, we completed an initial investment in CyVek, a start-up instrument company based in Connecticut. CyVek has developed a new multi-analyte immunoassay testing platform. Our large antibody content, along with our expertise in immunoassay development, perfectly complements CyVek's advances in microfluidics and sensor technology to ensure high precision and sensitivity in test performance. The CyPlex system has some unique features and benefits that some of our customers have been reflecting. While this product will be formally launched in the fall, it is already undergoing rigorous beta testing at several large academic and industrial laboratories and was introduced to the field at the recent AACR meeting and on the R&D Systems homepage, garnering great interest from both academic and industrial attendees. This is a very exciting opportunity that promises to build further relationships with clinical, academic and biopharma labs. With milestones achieved, we fully intend to acquire the remainder of the company in the next 15 months. You may have also seen a press release last week announcing our acquisition of PrimeGene, an agile protein ration start-up in Shanghai with 50 employees and over 400 products. This acquisition allows us to have manufacturing capabilities in China to make products for the Chinese market. Additionally, PrimeGene's low-cost products will serve as a fighter brand to help us compete more effectively both in China and worldwide without diluting the R&D Systems brand.  The PrimeGene team is a technically strong and ambitious group with -- and will work well with our existing China sales team. While small at the moment, PrimeGene is growing over 30% a year, rates comfortable to our organic growth in China with the investments we've made in people so far. With our technical and marketing help and global reach, there's plenty of upside to this investment.  As I have indicated at different investor meetings and conferences, we are a company that's trying to change to become more visible and more vocal with a strategy, direction and results in this business. We see changes in the industry regarding academic and industrial spending, and we are addressing this. We see shifts to new technologies, like multiplexing, and we are addressing them. We are very focused on getting our commercial process strengthened. Investments in China and then in the U.S. have been critical to regain our inorganic growth trajectory.  I believe innovation to be the long-term success factor in a science-driven company like ours, and we have made big steps to ensure we follow a set of product roadmaps that leverage our best technical platforms. Our new Chief Technology Officer has been a road warrior, creating strong new collaborations of key opinion leaders around the world.  And with 130 PhDs and hundreds of researchers across our company, we will protect our strong franchise in areas like proteins, antibodies and assays that researchers have long known us for and come to R&D Systems for. Building now on that franchise with other platforms and brands like Tocris and PrimeGene and other, this is a natural and logical strategy to follow. My last comment is that we continue to attract great talent, and I see a bright future in this business, given the increasing needs in health care and then need to continue to understand human biological processes, which can shed light onto many pathologies.  I think, with that, I'll turn back to Alisha, our moderator, who can now give directions for the Q&A portion of this call. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question is going to come from Dan Larry -- I'm sorry, Dan Leonard with Leerink Partners. Daniel Leonard : Question. We've heard different things from different companies, well, about their view of when the U.S. academic market is going to rebound. I'm curious, what's your view? Are you expecting improvements there in the second half of the calendar year? Or do you hold a different viewpoint? Charles Kummeth : Well, with the NIH funding being on a little bit above 3%, which is probably going to go more to wages and salaries and things, we don't see a great uplift. Now, the year-on-year comps start getting easier now. So I think you'll see all that play into everybody's results. I don't see a great lift. I think, as you see, our mix is going down in this area and much more towards industrial side, which we think is healthier. We still stay very focused on it. Our KOL strategy is entirely about that, and it's all about what's developed today is going to end up in industrial tomorrow. So it's important. But on -- it's not the great growth level in our strategy. I think it'll -- it won't get worse, but I don't think it will get a whole lot better. Daniel Leonard : That's helpful. And then on the investment in CyVek. Could you may be compare and contrast for me what that technology does versus what your capabilities already are through your Luminex relationship? Charles Kummeth : With that, we also have our Head of BD here with us who is the very technically better at this than I will, but Dr. Frank Mortari can explain that for us. Frank Mortari : Yes, Dan, the CyVek testing platform, we think, provides limited flexing capacity in immunoassay testing, along with a level of automations that customers are requesting. So the -- while at the same time also reducing the volume requirements in precious samples. So it provides a series of benefits that, I think, speed up the testing process. And also, it leverages exactly what we're known for, is the high -- and the depth of biological content that we've developed over the years. Charles Kummeth : So it's very important to know that this is not something that goes right straight after multiplexing. We still have strong relationships there, and they've all been in and they understand. This new device has no crosstalk. Over 4 analytes to begin with an hopefully moving up to more than that in the future. And the dynamic range is over 4 logs. So it's very sensitive and very fast and with a very small sample, as Frank pointed out, it's the kind of test that we're excited about because we think microfluidics is -- it's a trend that we have to deal with as a reagent provider anyway. So clear dollar strengths. And of course, to looking us is the people who are going to develop the panel and have the best -- the ability to create the right panels and assays on top of the instrument. Daniel Leonard : Got it. And then, my final question, Chuck. What's the right level of R&D spend for this business going forward? And I ask after a quarter where R&D spend as a percentage of revenue came in lower than it's been in a long time, if not ever? Charles Kummeth : Yes, it's not a concerted effort to lower spending here. I mean, I'm a innovation person, with 25 years at 3M, so, believe me, I think it's between 8% and 10%. Year-on-year spending in terms of real dollars were up. Just it's -- the mix is changing a little bit there. And, obviously, a business like Bionostics doesn't need a lot. It's an OEM business. So I fully expect that we will hover -- we'll probably be in the closer to 9% going forward in that range. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Hewitt with Hallum Capital. Matthew Hewitt : I've got a question. You were able to muscle through some pretty difficult weather, in January in particular. I mean, as we looked at it, we were thinking that there might be 5 to 7 days where you had basically lost from a shipping perspective. You were able to muscle through that. You commented in your prepared remarks about Thermo Fisher and not being able to quantify. I mean, was that really the delta in the quarter? Was that what enabled you to muscle through the weather? Charles Kummeth : Well, we had somewhere between 6 and 8 days of impact. As you know, you don't get much more of a run rate base business in ours. And literally, orders are -- come in and go out the same day to a certain degree. And when researchers aren't in the labs due to weather, they're not using our stuff. And they don't need to order more stuff. So we had about, actually, like a $1.4 million hit we quantified due to weather. So that's another 1.5% in growth that we didn't get. But everybody had that as well, so your term, muscling through it, I think is accurate. We had our people out, and our new sales team has been out there working. We had some extra lift that's probably in that range from Fisher, we think anyway. It's kind of working and probably going to be some mass investments going forward, but I really want to see what kind of traction we can really get with our new partner with 680 reps in the field. Matthew Hewitt : Okay. And then, secondly, regarding the PrimeGene. Having that complete now, having your fighter brand in China, how should we think about the ramp and how quickly, now that it's under your umbrella, we could see -- I don't -- you commented the 30% for the year, but after 2% here this quarter, and you do have some tough comps over the next few quarters, how quickly can we see that organic growth rates and, quite frankly, the PrimeGene contribution really start to drive China? Charles Kummeth : Yes, there's really 2 parts here. I -- we will continue to invest in China, and the Beijing office we opened this year is having some great results. We just hired a new sales director as an example to help get things moving at an increased scale. I think we're going to be in that range. I mean, we've been doing this before. And it seems like the scalability is there. PrimeGene will play into some of that because they're there, and we can localize products. And as you know, the Chinese are very -- those markets, as they devolve in these areas, are very price-conscious, so we'll have, I think, lift there. But it's much bigger than just China. We've tend to use this as a fighter brand worldwide. And in fact, PrimeGene has the few products that are absolutely phenomenal. And we're going to bring those over and market those as R&D facilities. And then we're going to have a lot of products that we feel have become commodities that, as you know, we've been struggling with academically, at least, that we're going to relabel those as PrimeGene and improve that overall portfolio. And that's a global strategy, not just China. But China is the first place to try it out all, get started, get moving. We are -- were starting to integrate already. Things take time. And even though it's all in Shanghai, it's a big city. It takes, with traffic, maybe an hour to get back and forth. So it's going to take a little while. A great team. Been talking to them for 9 months, so we know each other quite well at this point. But there's a lot of work to get done on the branding side, as you can imagine, and the catalogs. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Knight with Janney Montgomery. Paul Knight : Chuck, the nature of your deal, is it going to be more I'm taking an investment and then I accumulate an ownership position? Or is it going to be more like PrimeGene? Charles Kummeth : PrimeGene is a full acquisition, okay? But CyVek is investment for now. They're a start-up. They've got a thing called the burn rate, right? And I've -- it's difficult to be buying pre-revenue companies. So is taking care of shareholders but I think this is a prudent way to go and make sure that they are -- get to their milestones. If they get to their milestones, which we don't think are that horrendous, then we fully intend to buy them out. In the first level, it'll be a complete buyout. And then there's an earn-out at the second level. And I think we put all those in the 10-Q, 10-K. So that's all out there for public disclosure. Paul Knight : What's your targeted operating margin long term? Charles Kummeth : Well, there's the instrument side of the business and there's the assay side, right? So I would say, on the instruments side, it's going to be your typical 50%, 55%, like most instrument business try to strive for, and maybe 60% if we get lucky here. We'll see. It's early. It's the kind part they're working on. I'll be -- we're building confidence seems here for instruments, which we don't have really any right now and none on the machine side. But they're a great group. And they are in a great location, and the lead developer has something like 100 patents. I really like what I've seen. I've been, as Jim has as well, been in instrument businesses before. So we like it. The cartridge size is actually much better. Again, as I mentioned, I think of that as a next-generation kind of a parallel ELISA. When you start looking at the value prop for a 4- or 8-analyte ELISA-type system, the numbers could go quite large, especially for a test that happens in under an hour, with pretty much a walkaway mode. There's no tubes, no buffers, no anything. So it's kind of a we'll wait and see. But I think as emerge, and I always run businesses and consumables that they roughly should be about -- within 3 to 5 years, the consumable business should be as big as the instrument side. And so merging those together, let's say, 65%, hopefully, in that range. But it's really an unknown right now. These are all goals. It's a start-up. And we have many machines in beta testing right now. It is working, but, as you all know, a lot of people have been here before, too. There's a lot of homework to get done. So... Paul Knight : Will you -- what's your targeted overall Bio-Techne operating margin? Charles Kummeth : Yes, I mean, I think as the business stands today, in our current makeup, I'd say the kind of margins that we delivered in Q3 would be something we'd expect going forward in terms of operating margins in the 50% range and gross margin blended in the 70% -- low 70% range. But obviously, depending on how that mix might change going forward, it could alter. But on a standalone basis, that's what I'd expect going forward. Paul Knight : And then lastly on the -- with China acquisition and your global initiatives, do you see the tax rate falling? Or where is the trend on tax rate? Charles Kummeth : I hope falling, yes. We're now -- now we're passed the comps on the credit, the R&D credit. So as you see, that has an impact. And I don't like sitting at 31% more than anybody else does, but it is what it is until we work on this issue. I mean, China is still a small piece of our business as that continues to grow, outpace the growth of the overall company, it should help the tax rate, given that China's got a lower tax rate than the U.S. does. So... Operator : The next question comes from Jeff Elliott with Robert W. Baird. Jeffrey Elliott : My first question is on China. Can you walk me through the comp issues that you mentioned January of last year and talk about the pacing you saw in both February and March of this quarter? Charles Kummeth : Yes, I just say it's really pretty simple. We had a couple large account buys in January of last year. And again, this is pretty small business base wise on the rest of our business. So that had an impact. Looking forward into February, March, the growth rates month year-on-year are comparable. Historically, this business has been around 18% to 20%. I think at the beginning of last year, just short of 20%. This year, I think, we're going to be well north of 25%. I've been very public about stating our strategy, our goal, is near 30%. I think we got a good shot at near 30%. So going forward it should be that with the investments we're making there in people and buying companies, et cetera, and all the above. So... Jeffrey Elliott : Okay, great. Next question, on the U.S. sales force. Can you talk about how the sale force has ramped since you added some headcount there? Charles Kummeth : I've got to tell you, when I ran the LCD for Thermo and the division is separate in Thermo Fisher from the Fisher side, which is neutral, as you know. And there's always a lot of channel conflict around that, because, in the case of that, they would -- Fisher wouldn't sell Corning & Eppendorf along with the Thermo brands. And so getting the reps working together to really make that channel model work to leverage the big Fisher was always challenging. We've made it work. They're making it work fantastically now, as you can see, by their progress. They're getting through a stake in a few years, but it's working. On our side here, there's no conflict. I mean, it's worked well. We've got 5 rock star reps that we hired. And I've been with every one of them, and I've talked to every one of them and made sure how they felt about this. And they are open arms over this, and they are working with all the field people. As you know, the -- as part of the arrangement there, there are 30 technical specialists as well, which our people marry up with and work the deals. They couldn't be happier or more pleased to have the help out there and then drive this big engine. So we're still very bullish that this is going to be a good thing. Now as I mentioned before, it's not to double the accompany or anything like that, but we expect to have, I'd say, compared to historically, our third-party sales with Fisher before we did all this, over the next 2 or 3 years, will probably triple the amount of volume we pushed through. With that first -- first-level amount, we're probably in the swap range. But we're not seeing, as I said before, a lot of margin differences either. They're paid really on the gross uplift. And it seems to be working. But the attitudes are fantastic. They featured us at their show. We're at the platinum level. So it's what they're trying to move and sell. And as I mentioned, with the what the million products that Fisher is moving and trying to always do it day in and day out on all these laboratories, you don't get a lot of a PI's time when you're in there pushing pipetted tips and flaps and cell factories, et cetera, and reagents. You start bringing in the kinds of high-level content that we have and then you start getting notice from decision-makers in the laboratories. And that allows them, of course, to pull through many, many more of their products, which is why they want to do this. Why it's so important to them and probably, to a large degree in the reagent side, why they like the life tech business as well. So long term, it's going to be very good for them. They're starting to figure out how to be a high-content supplier, and we're here to help them with our piece of it in North America. Jeffrey Elliott : Okay, great. And just lastly, on capital deployment. Obviously, over $370 million in cash. Can you talk about what you're looking at in terms of capital deployment? And how big of an acquisition do you think you could pull off at this point? Charles Kummeth : Okay. Well, let me see. We still have no debt, and we're still generating the same kind of cash flow we have been. So you got the numbers like we have. You start putting in with what we can do on a term A and term B and we're well north $1 billion. We took a shot at a HyClone, which is up in that range, and came in second. Hard to beat GE when they get serious, of course. But we have that kind of wherewithall. We haven't done anything yet larger because we're being very careful and whatever we do, as I've mentioned many times, you're going to see direct synergies. So with PrimeGene, it's a no-brainer. With CyVek, it's a no-brainer around synergies with our reagents. And if we do a larger deal, you'll see the same kind of strategy follow. So we have the ability do something much bigger. And obviously, we have a lot of things we're looking at. My team and I have a strong M&A background, and we're hoppering [ph] and filtering and ranking and well over 60, 70 different targets worldwide. As you know, this is a very, very fast-moving industry. And every month, there's another couple of new potentials out there, CyVek being as a good example in the last year. It's a great new technology. So there are other great -- other assets that are larger, and we're looking at all of them. And if something makes sense, we'll do it. And if not, we won't. So... Operator : And the final question in queue comes from Amanda Murphy at William Blair. Amanda Murphy : I just had one quick one. Could you just talk a little bit about the performance of the business by business line, meaning proteins, antibodies and then [indiscernible]? Charles Kummeth : Yes. Amanda, sorry. We don't ever comment on that. Amanda Murphy : Okay, then it'll be a quick question. I guess... Charles Kummeth : I mean, we have -- we are out there showing the split, roughly all about 1/3 each in the company. Starting to change some. Hopefully, the PrimeGene, we'll see more growth in proteins and kind of cut off the small amount of erosion that we're seeing in the low end. But we don't comment on results in each area. Amanda Murphy : Okay. And then, I guess, I'll sneak another one and then. So the Fisher agreement, can you just maybe remind us what components of your business that sort of benefits? Is it just the U.S.? Or is it globalized. I don't recall exactly? Charles Kummeth : It's really all North America. It's U.S. and Canada, primarily. And I will mention, in Canada, we go through a distributor and I'm not very happy. And that we should be much bigger. Fisher has a lot of reps in Canada. So we're definitely putting together trying our plans up to work in Canada, and which they like as well because there's no term channel swap there at all. Everything we do there is virtually incremental growth. So it's -- in a way, it's kind of low-hanging fruit, we think. So lot of emphasis in Canada, but it's U.S. and Canada primarily. Operator : There are no other questions in queue. Charles Kummeth : Well, we can give it a minute or 2. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And there are no questions in queue, sir. Charles Kummeth : Okay. Well, I guess, with that, we'll end this call. I want to thank you all for attending. We've continued to make, I think, reasonable progress here. Pretty big moves these company made year-on-year in terms of year-to-date organic growth rates. I think our investments have been the right investments, and they're starting to work. They're not too expensive either, but we will continue to go forward with that strategy as well. And I look forward to speaking to all of you offline and in the near future. Thank you.",

Baird & Company Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company Dan Leonard - Leerink Partners Brian Kipp - Janney Capital Markets Operator : Good morning. And welcome to the Bio-Techne Earnings Conference Call for the Fourth Quarter of the Full Year Fiscal 2014. At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for questions following the management\u2019s prepared remarks. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jim Hippel, Chief Financial Officer. Jim Hippel : [Technical Difficulty] -- as well as meeting with customers. Also on the call with me is Frank Mortari, Vice President, Corporate Development. Before we begin, let me briefly cover our Safe Harbor statement. Some of the remarks made during this conference call should be considered forward-looking statements. The Company's 10-K for fiscal year 2013 and 10-Q filed for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2014, identifies certain factors that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements during this call. The Company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of any new information or future events or developments. The 10-K and 10-Q as well as the Company's other SEC filings are available on the Company\u2019s Web site within its Investor Relations section. During the call, non-GAAP financial measures may be used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. Tables reconciling these measures to most comparable GAAP measures are available in the Company's press release issued earlier this morning or on the Techne Corporation Web site at www.techne-corp.com. So with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Chuck. Chuck Kummeth :  Thanks Jim. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. As I stated in our earnings release, I\u2019m extremely pleased with the quarter but even more pleased with the year-end results. To come back from negative growth last year to 3% organic growth this year given the headwinds of NIH funding and increasing competition is a great achievement for this team. We started the year telling all of you in our first ever earnings call, that we would achieve better than historical growth rates in China which were in the 15% to 20% range raising them into the high 20s. We actually achieved 37% organic growth in China for Q4 and 27% for the year. Investments made in China are paying off. By next year with our continuing growth in China over 25% and the acquisitions of PrimeGene growing 30%, Novus and ProteinSimple we should be able to both the Bio-Techne China company that has drawn from 12 million in revenue last year, 12 over 30 million by this time next year. It\u2019s a very exciting time for Asia business. As we\u2019ve done all year, we continue to strengthen our commercial execution in North America in this quarter, while we have no weather to content with like last quarter we still had a difficult year-over-year comp with regard to academic sales. However, by leveraging our field sales investments in Fisher relationship, our academic sales have stabilized since Q1 of 2014, positioning us to accelerate growth next year with the introduction of the PrimeGene and Novus fighter brands. Turning to Europe, we did see some lumpiness there in the past several quarters similar to where other peers have reported. In Q4 we had some Easter seasonality in results but the quarter was less than we had hoped for. Overall for the year, we did have some organic growth over the previous year. We believe the strategic acquisitions we have made will really help our Europe business since these businesses can leverage our strong operations in Europe. Novus is growing at a double-digit rate in Europe as an example. We are also confident in the potential future ProteinSimple in Europe. These businesses are firing in all cylinders. To speak on these strategic acquisitions, 2014 was a very active year for Bio-Techne especially in Q4 of fiscal 2014. We started the year with the acquisition of Bionostics, which expanded our clinical control segment to include control solutions in IVD devices used in blood glucose coagulation and blood gas testing. Our team did work very hard throughout the year on a number of targets accumulated into two acquisitions in Q4 and two more which closed in July. First we made substantial equity investment in CyVek, structured to be an acquisition after certain commercial thresholds are met. CyVek produces a transformative immunoassay platform which delivers a most advanced and efficient bench top immunoassay system. We filed this in Q4 by acquiring PrimeGene which will provide us manufacturing capabilities in China and a fighter brand for recombinant proteins here in the U.S. And in July we announced and subsequently closed the acquisitions of Novus and ProteinSimple. Novus took standard portfolio of antibody offerings to a protein 250,000 which can be delivered to our customers through an innovative digital commerce platform and ProteinSimple provide our customers with instruments that have revolutionized the analysis of Proteins in terms of reliability, consistency and productivity. All these acquisitions fuel our long-term strategic plan to expand our customer offering and geographic coverage while leveraging our core product base of the agency controls. We even changed the trade name of the company, to Bio-Techne which unifies and positions our brands under one complete portfolio. Despite all the activity this year around acquisitions, we have not lost focus on our strategic pillar of driving innovation to produce core products to fulfill a greater number of our customer needs. In fiscal year \u201914, we released approximately 1,600 new products which generated $3.4 million of new revenue in first year. This compares to approximately 2,100 new products released in fiscal year \u201913, which generated only 2.4 million of new revenue in year one. Our prioritization process is already starting to bear fruit and we believe there is much more to come with the key opinion leader network in scientific advisory board that our new CTO has created to collaborate on tools needed to support the leading edge of life sciences research. Overall, I am extremely proud of the work out team has done this year and want to thank our employees for all their efforts. We have worked hard to build a stronger global team and it is paying off. As NIH and other funding return to more healthy levels, we intend to capitalize on the pent up needs for tools and reagents that researchers need for their work. We have and we will continue invest in innovation and quality further demonstrating the Bio-Techne as the premier brand and the premier global biotech company. Jim I will turn over to you now for dive into these financials. Jim Hippel : Alright, thanks Chuck. Given that this is a year-end call and we just closed the Novus and ProteinSimple acquisitions. I have a number of topics to cover in remarks this morning. First I\u2019ll start with an overview of our Q4 and full year 2014 financial performance. Next I\u2019ll provide you a recap of the terms regarding revolving credit facility that was open partially fund the ProteinSimple acquisition. And finally although we do not provide future guidance and we\u2019ll provide some additional financial data and longer term goal regarding our recent acquisition giving more clarity as the impact these acquisitions may have on our financial performance in 2015 and the years following. So, starting with the overall recent financial performance. We delivered a solid fourth quarter resulting 7% increase in adjusted EPS to $0.88. For the full year adjusted EPS was up6% compared to prior fiscal year to a record $3.39. As detailed in our press release adjusted earnings per share exclude acquisition related cost, is a cost such as intangible asset amortization cost recognized upon the sale of inventory that was written up to fair value and professional fees related ongoing acquisition activity, also excluded the impact of certain taxes. Under GAAP EPS was $0.72 in Q4 and $3 even for the full year compared to $0.77 and $3.05 in Q4 and full year 2013 respectively. On the top line Q4 total revenue was 92.5 million an increase of 16% year-over-year an organic growth was 2%. Q4 reported revenue include 13% growth from our Bionostics and PrimeGene, PrimeGene not only sale and approximately 1% impact in foreign exchange. For the full year total revenue increased 15% year-over-year and organic growth was 3%. Full year growth includes 11% from acquisition and 1% impact in foreign exchange. Moving on to the detail the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin came in at 73.4% in Q4 down 320 basis points in the prior year to the products interchange associated with the acquisition of Bionostics last July. Excluding Bionostics gross margins were essentially flat compared to last year. Adjusted SG&A in Q4 was 14.1% of revenue approximately 30 basis points more in the prior year. The full year 2014 adjusted SG&A was 13.5% of revenue 40 basis points higher than 2013. The modest increase is a result of the commercial and infrastructure investments made throughout fiscal year 2014. Finally, R&D expense came in at 8.3% of revenue for the quarter 80 basis points below the prior year. For full year 2014 R&D expense with 8.6% of revenue also 80 basis points below 2013. For both Q4 and full year higher overall spend on R&D actually is partially offset by greater revenue generation in new products launch as Chuck discussed in his opening comments. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. The headline numbers are $37.9 million in cash generated from operations for the fourth quarter and a $136.8 million for the full year was up 26% and 11% respectively over the prior. At year end we had $363 million of cash in short-term available-for-sale investment. There is a large portion of these investments liquidating in the cash in Q4 to prepare for funding of the July Novus and ProteinSimple acquisitions. As a fiscal year end we had no debt. Our investment in capital expenditures was $13.8 million for the full year and we returned over $45 million to our shareholders in the form of dividend. That wraps up my comments on the total company performance for the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year. Now I\u2019ll walk you through revenue performance of our two business segments, starting with biotechnology system. This is the larger of our two segments which develops, manufactures, and sell biotechnology research and diagnostic products worldwide. For the fourth quarter the biotechnology segment reported $76.7 million revenue and 1% organic growth compared to fourth quarter last year. Full year revenue for the segment was $300.6 million with organic at 3% for this year. The lower growth in Q4 was mostly attributable to year which was down 3%. The timing of Easter in Q4 this year versus Q4 last year as well as the timing in larger bulk orders that occurred in Q3 versus Q4 last year attributed decreases. However despite continues softness in academic market and consolidation in Big Pharma, Europe managed to achieve positive 1% growth for the year. In the U.S. industrial customers such as pharma and biotech in the biotechnology segment continue to grow 4% in Q4 which is consistent with the growth we saw from these customers all the year. U.S. academia on the other hand continues to be softened for the last year down 8% for the fourth quarter and down 9% for the year. However, as Chuck indicated in his opening comment U.S. academic sales bottom in the first half of fiscal year \u201814 and the run rate has been relatively stable nice. Thus we are expecting this piece of our business to improve next year, with the addition newly acquired brands to our portfolio as well as in overall more stable environment with the proposed NIH funding. As for biotechnology sales in China Chuck has pretty much shared the highlights there just a great quarter in Q4 the 37% organic growth in the quarter compared to fourth quarter last year to cap up over the great year and experienced 27% organic growth over last year. I\u2019ll note that these numbers are slightly different than those in the press release is close as China region including those figures are Taiwan and Hong Kong which are more mature market and that\u2019s usually experience lower growth basically in China. Looking ahead to next year we expect to continue to achieve strong growth in China both organically and from our recent acquisition. Finally, the Pacific Rim which generated about 10% of the biotechnology segment\u2019s revenues, we experienced organic growth of 5% for Q4 and 10 for the full year. The lower growth rate in Q4 was driven by the timing of the number of orders in Japan that occurred in the cost of Q3 versus Q4. The region\u2019s growth rate for full year is indicative of our expectations going forward. Turning now to the -- our other segment, clinical controls which develops blood controls and calibrators for use in hospitals and clinics. This segment closed Q4 with $15.8 million of revenue and finished the full year with $57.2 million. Organic growth which excludes the Bionostics last July was 8% in Q4 and 7% for the full year rounding out a year of solid and consistent demand and operational execution. Now before I turn the call over for Q&A I would like to provide some additional insight into the financials of our most recent acquisitions and investment as well as reminder on the financing details most of which were communicated in the recently 8-K. I will start with the financing. All of our acquisitions and investments in Q4 were funded with cash on hand. This includes our investment in CyVek as well as our purchase of PrimeGene. In early July of fiscal year \u201915 our purchase of Novus was also funded with cash on hand. And in late July of fiscal year 15, our purchase of ProteinSimple was funded by a combination of cash on hand as well as $150 million revolving credit facility that was opened with BMO Harris Bank. $125 million of this credit facility was drawn upon to fund the purchase of ProteinSimple. The interest in this facility accrues at available rate of LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 1% to 1.75% depending on certain leverage ratio. Currently, our interest expense on our debt is accruing at 1.16%. The one time bank fees associated with opening the credit facility was 375,000 and ongoing fees for any unused portion of the credit facility as 15 basis points per annum. Now from financial details on the acquisition themselves. Going in chronological order, I will start with CyVek. CyVek is not really an acquisition yet but rather an equity investment that was made on April 1, 2014 with a commitment to acquire within 12 months if certain future milestones are met. CyVek will have no impact on our P&L until the time it is fully purchased. As of right now the milestones are on track and we expect the full purchase to consummate sometime in the second half of fiscal year \u201915. Next is PrimeGene. As we announced in a prior press release, PrimeGene was acquired on April 30, 2014 had an immaterial impact to our fiscal year \u201914 results. In calendar year 2013, PrimeGene had product sales of approximately $4 million with growth in operating margins that were similar to the rest of our biotechnology segment. Over the next five years we have aspirations for this business to increase 30% annually as it continues to grow in a rapidly expanding local Chinese market but also has an OEM supplier of private brand to be launched in U.S. and Europe. The acquisition of Novus followed PrimeGene on July 2nd 2014. Novus\u2019s calendar year 2013 revenue was approximately $19 million. It is wide product offering of over 225,000 antibodies necessitate the large mix of OEM supplies versus proprietary products. Thus it is gross margins are lower than our current biotechnology segment and roughly 15% while EBITDA margin during mid-teens. Our aspiration over the next five years for this business to grow organically in the upper single digit annually with EBITDA margins approaching 30% by year five, our intention for this growth to be supplemented by R&D systems brand leveraging Novus\u2019 digital commerce platform and Novus leveraging existing Bio-Techne\u2019s global sales channels and proprietary capabilities. Finally, our latest acquisition and thus far our largest, ProteinSimple closed July 31, 2014. ProteinSimple\u2019s revenue for the last 12 months ended June 30 2014 was approximately $60 million with EBITDA of approximately $9 million. Gross margins for the past year have been in the 60% range which is quite strong for an instrument-based business signifying the novel technology of the platform and high consumable pull-through. Our aspiration over the next five years for this business is to maintain a 20% annual growth rate as protein simple continues revolutionize the Western Blotty have done in the past 30 years by investing in further global commercial penetration in existing instruments and further innovation on next generation platforms. Through gradual sales leverage on these investments, we see the potential for EBITDA margins to approach the upper 20% range by year five. These numbers don\u2019t factor in other aspirations to source consumables used by ProteinSimple instruments from existing Bio-Techne reagents, nor possible sales synergies with the eventual CyVek instruments which we expect to own by the end of this year. These synergies we believe are real for we\u2019re putting the time table and valuation on them right now is not practical. That concludes my prepared comments. And with that I will turn the call back over to moderator to open the line up for some questions. Question: and: Operator :  (Operator Instructions) And our first question will come from Matt Hewitt with Craig-Hallum Capital. Please go ahead. Matt Hewitt :  Just a couple of questions, first, you\u2019ve been very busy on the M&A front and the investment front. I am curious as you look at your portfolio today, where do you see some gaps? What should we be anticipating as we get into fiscal 15? Where are some areas that you think you might be investing to broaden your portfolio? Craig:  Just a couple of questions, first, you\u2019ve been very busy on the M&A front and the investment front. I am curious as you look at your portfolio today, where do you see some gaps? What should we be anticipating as we get into fiscal 15? Where are some areas that you think you might be investing to broaden your portfolio? Hallum Capital :  Just a couple of questions, first, you\u2019ve been very busy on the M&A front and the investment front. I am curious as you look at your portfolio today, where do you see some gaps? What should we be anticipating as we get into fiscal 15? Where are some areas that you think you might be investing to broaden your portfolio? Chuck Kummeth : We don\u2019t run on the schedule for acquisition. You run a process, and you run an offer, and you work it they kind of pick on your timing, we were unfortunate to succeed in a pretty high percentage of trial this year. And there will be more I am sure in the future. We are following our strategic plan pretty carefully and we\u2019ve talked as far back as about a year ago now with our initial come out, our strategic plan. And in broadening our portfolio antibodies is one of the key things we want to do which we have done with Novus. There are certainly other categories of antibodies that are in more narrow product platform ranges like antibodies around flow or around IHC, they could be significant and could be more than useful specially antibodies they could work within our systems, our new platform that we acquired, and going after new territories like China for IBD and other areas like that and et cetera. We are also always on the hunt for new CyVek-like and ProteinSimple-like platform. We have mentioned many times that we\u2019re not going to in instrument business to be instrument business. We like content and we want to drive that content and value our content and full solutions for our customers. And if this can be done with a novel new instrument that leverages our content in a way never done before like CyVek and ProteinSimple do then we\u2019re interested. And there are other areas or categories that there were we\u2019re looking and you're probably as well familiar with them as we are and this is a biotech industry and there is a new way to do all these laboratory processes all the time and anyone that comes out that have IP that look novel that look like they re-leverage and benefit from our content we\u2019re interested, so I would say stay tuned. Matt Hewitt : Okay, all right, fair enough, and maybe one more. There is a new proposal in the Senate right now that is looking to boost the NIH funding. It's not the 2% to 3% type increases that I think we have become accustomed to over the past few years, or even cuts. This drive could drive 10% growth in NIH spending over the next few years. I'm curious if you had to -- I realize it's the government, but if you had to handicap the reality or the potential for that to occur, and what that would mean for your business, that type of an increase in NIH spending? Craig: Okay, all right, fair enough, and maybe one more. There is a new proposal in the Senate right now that is looking to boost the NIH funding. It's not the 2% to 3% type increases that I think we have become accustomed to over the past few years, or even cuts. This drive could drive 10% growth in NIH spending over the next few years.

It's not the 2% to 3% type increases that I think we have become accustomed to over the past few years, or even cuts. This drive could drive 10% growth in NIH spending over the next few years. I'm curious if you had to -- I realize it's the government, but if you had to handicap the reality or the potential for that to occur, and what that would mean for your business, that type of an increase in NIH spending? Chuck Kummeth : Yes, I saw the article. I think right now it\u2019s pretty early to conjecture its merit or how long it will take. Obviously if you go through and thee is funding level getting back to upper single digits to 10% we\u2019re going to benefit for sure being with the leader in proteins in world, so for sure that will happen. And so if it does because as we broaden our portfolio and expand another offerings and hope to become one of the largest provider of antibodies as well in the world, we should do well with this, so I wish good luck. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Elliott with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead, sir. Jeff Elliott : Good morning and congratulations on the quarter. I heard the comments about China, where you expect the run rates to be next year, but what do you thinking from a split of organic growth and acquired growth? What's baked into that assumption? Robert W. Baird & Company: Good morning and congratulations on the quarter. I heard the comments about China, where you expect the run rates to be next year, but what do you thinking from a split of organic growth and acquired growth? What's baked into that assumption? Chuck Kummeth : I would say right now on their core organic growth, you could continue to count on estimates 25% range and like we stated. Everything above that which the number that kind we kind of showed I guess would on top within organic of course. And as ProteinSimple and Novus and PrimeGene grow in China, which will also growth at great numbers, great growth rates, it will hopefully at least keep pace with our core organic growth. I would long term if we could say pace organically remember here from now these deals will become organic, if we could stay that 25% rate or better that will fantastic goal for us. And that is close we think we can be. Jeff Elliott : Okay. Chuck, in your opening comments you mentioned increasing competition. Can you elaborate on what you meant by that? Robert W. Baird & Company: Okay. Chuck, in your opening comments you mentioned increasing competition. Can you elaborate on what you meant by that? Chuck Kummeth : Nothing more than what we have seen. The likes of Pepper Techs and Abcams and then a lot of smaller players are getting bigger and stronger. The door was opened to all of the funding cuts here in last two to three years with above this being tight and customer is taking chances on lower quality products and in some instances getting their work done acceptably, at least initial research done that way. As you know from our growth margin, this is a profitable business and this is going attack attention. I don\u2019t see that going away. And in China it\u2019s only going, if there are great opportunities in China, the growth rates are wonderful but with all that growth and all these opportunities in embryonic nature the biotechnology industry in China, I think you\u2019re going to see more and more players as well. This is why we have such a strong strategic initiative in China to remain a leader and even accelerate that leadership position. And having PrimeGene, it\u2019s going to allow us kind of double-decker kind of approach here. Jeff Elliott : What do the margins look like on the PrimeGene product? I guess you can expand that over to the U.S. and Europe. How should we think about the gross margins on that? Robert W. Baird & Company: What do the margins look like on the PrimeGene product? I guess you can expand that over to the U.S. and Europe. How should we think about the gross margins on that? Chuck Kummeth : Actually, it\u2019s kind of weird because as you know most companies expand in China and we\u2019ve all done in few times in different industries and Chinese, they are very price conscious and you usually have lower margin in China and I would say overall and we\u2019ve stayed overall, we\u2019ll see lower margins in China, PrimeGene is very similar to our business right now but it\u2019s also very, very small. So with that kind of basis it\u2019s really not something that glean a lot of input out of but all they run a good business and the margins are very strong and probably much better than typical for what the Chinese competitor. Operator :  Our next question comes from Amanda Murphy with William Blair. Please go ahead. Amanda Murphy : Just a question on organic growth. So obviously there is a lot of moving parts with Europe and China and then some of the comp dynamics going forward. So I am just curious how should we think about the rate, organic growth rate. It\u2019s been a bit lumpy over the past year, although obviously accelerated from prior levels. So just trying to get a sense of 3% or the 5% for example? William Blair & Company: Just a question on organic growth. So obviously there is a lot of moving parts with Europe and China and then some of the comp dynamics going forward. So I am just curious how should we think about the rate, organic growth rate. It\u2019s been a bit lumpy over the past year, although obviously accelerated from prior levels. So just trying to get a sense of 3% or the 5% for example? Chuck Kummeth :  We don\u2019t provide we\u2019ve given you kind of over long-term sinking is. Our goal is to get to the mid-single digit. We had a good move in that direction from negative last year. I\u2019d like to tell you Amanda that we\u2019re going to hit 5% in organic growth this year. I mean it\u2019s good with we\u2019ll see what happens if we truly have funding issues behind it\u2019s a closest competition, we\u2019ve a better chance I think, it will rely on how well we do with the Fisher type relationship how we manage our channels and how we leverage possible synergies with some acquisition with our core organic products right now. And all that comes together well all-in-all I think north of 3% is more than just possible should be doable. Getting above 5% though would be very difficult at this point given that we still see as headwinds in Europe is still kind of a difficult question. So\u2026 Amanda Murphy :  And in terms of Fisher, I don\u2019t you think you mentioned the contribution from that this quarter, has that been meaningful and thinking about that going forward just obviously there is a lot going on in this space in terms of M&A, so curious how you are looking at that specific relationship.  William Blair & Company:  And in terms of Fisher, I don\u2019t you think you mentioned the contribution from that this quarter, has that been meaningful and thinking about that going forward just obviously there is a lot going on in this space in terms of M&A, so curious how you are looking at that specific relationship. Chuck Kummeth : It is going very well. The work together on the two companies with the systems we call the punch out systems especially in areas with Luminex kits and other concept that they were very eager to get their hands on and move for us, it\u2019s going very well. I mean the growth rates are amazing it\u2019s just too small. They are getting trend in they are getting more comfortable, the numbers are roughly double levels that they were a quarter ago. It is only a partial quarter, so it\u2019s moving the right direction for sure. And as you know Amanda, we know we have to also deal with potential swap or the real number there is certainly some swap in that too. We certainly have some institutions that are saying well now let\u2019s make things simple and everything to Fisher and buy so much other stuff from Fisher. So we had some sales from direct before so some of that\u2019s working through as well, we\u2019re creating all the right dashboards and working together to find out what\u2019s what, they are extremely focused on incremental growth, they are paid that way as you know, that\u2019s the incentives are. So areas like where they are going into Canada, very, very heavily are some strong areas we are looking at with them and overall I am very encouraged that it\u2019s looking very good.  If you look at what we would call the U.S. retail segment in the academic sector, as we mentioned we are the nine from either this quarter we\u2019ve been double digit down every quarter before this. I think some of that is coming from channel, coming from health of Fisher it was definitely taking up the ball in our academic retail space. Amanda Murphy : And then just last one, can you talk a little bit about M&A, I am curious, I think you said in the past that you are comfortable with sort of three times leverage numbers is that still true? And curious kind of what -- just I guess generally what\u2019s your appetite for larger deals and what sort of the opportunity there and have you done quite a few already, so curious if you are done [indiscernible]. William Blair & Company: And then just last one, can you talk a little bit about M&A, I am curious, I think you said in the past that you are comfortable with sort of three times leverage numbers is that still true? And curious kind of what -- just I guess generally what\u2019s your appetite for larger deals and what sort of the opportunity there and have you done quite a few already, so curious if you are done [indiscernible]. Chuck Kummeth :  Yes, we\u2019ve got plenty of dry powder left. I\u2019m going to let Jim follow on with my answer with some more details but I think we\u2019re not out to be a PE type company, we\u2019re not going to be riding the line like a thermal fisher we just don\u2019t have that kind of experience or credibility yet, so I think staying safe after 35 years of no debt, I think being between two and three times of leverage I think is a safe place to be, though we will always cover our covenants, cover any mishap in the economy whatever all should happen, we\u2019re going to be patient, very patient. Jim, do you want to say anything else? Jim Hippel :  Yes, I will just add. Just a three times leverage is still our comfort range in general we do have a lot to digest right now with the recent acquisitions we did, but the good news there is that we\u2019ve also inherited some strong management teams with those acquisitions which I think will make the simulation so to speak in the Bio-Techne go that much smoother and quicker. And so if and when the right opportunity comes, if it\u2019s a large one I think we will be ready. Operator :  (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Dan Leonard with Leerink. Please go ahead. Dan Leonard : Thank you. ProteinSimple considered coming public to aggressively expand their investment in sales and marketing, among other things. Is that still the plan, now that the business is part of Bio-Techne, or do you envision a different level of investment for that business? Leerink Partners : Thank you. ProteinSimple considered coming public to aggressively expand their investment in sales and marketing, among other things. Is that still the plan, now that the business is part of Bio-Techne, or do you envision a different level of investment for that business? Chuck Kummeth : Our plan with ProteinSimple is to leverage their plan with the content we create. Since this has to have antibodies and proteins that really work within the customer's hands, we provide a lot of different contents in order to customer they want for full solution. So that\u2019s the magic. It\u2019s going to take probably year to make all that happen, but it\u2019s a rocket life it\u2019s [indiscernible]. To be honest, my big issue is to make sure all the stay away. This thing is doing great and it\u2019s growing in year, we\u2019re going to leverage a lot of our resources in Europe operationally. They're very small in China but exploding we\u2019re going to leverage that heavily, so I would say tactically optionally it would help a lot of on the science synergy front long-term point where the investment maybe you\u2019re talking are going to be coming over next as we integrate and as we worked together and where is the appropriate integration, why shouldn\u2019t we work on together, okay, we didn\u2019t put anything in the S1 or anything else there their West type form is way ahead of expectations, what really excited us is the fact that academia is eating it up. They love it. We also thought that might hard pill to swallow with their funding concerns, but it appears not. Dan Leonard : Chuck, how much detail do you plan to offer on ProteinSimple's business? For example West, can you disclose how many West placements they had in the June quarter? Leerink Partners : Chuck, how much detail do you plan to offer on ProteinSimple's business? For example West, can you disclose how many West placements they had in the June quarter? Chuck Kummeth : We're not going to disclose anything yet, but we expect this question, so with two divisions so far and not going into this instrument we\u2019re going to have to an instrument division probably instrumentation segment to layout for you. You\u2019re going to get lots of data but it\u2019s too early right now but we\u2019re going -- it\u2019s next quarter we\u2019re probably going to see I think a lot entries are coming in. Dan Leonard : Okay. I know you don't want to provide guidance, but at least on the expense line, can you talk about what you're budgeting for operating expenses in fiscal 15? And the reason I ask is it is just difficult to figure out if the ProteinSimple deal is accretive, dilutive, or neutral to 2015? Leerink Partners : Okay. I know you don't want to provide guidance, but at least on the expense line, can you talk about what you're budgeting for operating expenses in fiscal 15? And the reason I ask is it is just difficult to figure out if the ProteinSimple deal is accretive, dilutive, or neutral to 2015? Chuck Kummeth : I will say that we feel it will be accretive. We\u2019re not to give much guidance beyond that. In terms of our operating expense this year going forward I know in the last year in nine months ago on the first call, you guys were gave a lot of questions about how hard will I invest, what we will is we\u2019ll eat in the margin significantly and there was a lot potential fear around that. If you can see results, we didn\u2019t really impact our gross margin at all. With a lot hiring and a lot of new execs, a lot of new promotional activities, we more than double in from 12 people to like in China, so in all that it\u2019s paying itself all right, that will have to go forward is probably reduced. We\u2019re not going to be investing in same level. Our goal is to definitely have EPS growth and I think I\u2019ll leave with that. Jim, you may want to given little more color around this? Jim Hippel : Yes, I would say for our core business and we\u2019re still in a at least a two-year build in terms of investment and basic infrastructure and sales, commercial reach et cetera that Chuck kicked off last year and so we\u2019re in fiscal 15 we\u2019re kind of year two with that, it will be somewhat lesser rate, but I feel there will still be investment. I would say overall when you look at core business as well as ProteinSimple, we\u2019re going to reinvest in par with our revenue growth rate that\u2019s the way I think about it particularly in ProteinSimple where they\u2019re still very much in a ramp mode. Chuck Kummeth : We definitely want to see that need. Operator : Our next question comes from Suresh with SBH. Please go ahead. Good morning, Suresh with SBH, if have a question, please go ahead. (Operator Instructions) We have a question from Paul Knight with Janney Capital. Please go ahead. Brian Kipp : Hi, guys, this is actually Brian Kipp on behalf of Paul. Thanks for taking the question. You guys alluded to your Novus platform and the potential to expand your e-commerce channels via the Novus acquisition. Where are you with current -- the Bio-Techne franchise on converting from catalog to e-commerce? And in conjunction with that, what's your horizon to consolidate all these new acquisitions into a uniform platform to drive additional cost synergies? Is that several years out, or just thoughts around that? Janney Capital Markets : Hi, guys, this is actually Brian Kipp on behalf of Paul. Thanks for taking the question. You guys alluded to your Novus platform and the potential to expand your e-commerce channels via the Novus acquisition. Where are you with current -- the Bio-Techne franchise on converting from catalog to e-commerce? And in conjunction with that, what's your horizon to consolidate all these new acquisitions into a uniform platform to drive additional cost synergies? Is that several years out, or just thoughts around that? Chuck Kummeth : That\u2019s great question. Clearly when I arrived we talked a lot about branding and improving the customer experience with a much better Web site and we\u2019ve kicked off a lot of that work and we\u2019re going to be launching our first phase of that this next quarter for Bio-Techne. Now here we think this acquisition and guess what they\u2019ve got their own initiative, their own Web site and all the tests to be kind of integrated and melded, right. And you\u2019ve seen this moving forward. We love both because they\u2019ve got a lot of great additional platform. They have some internal platforms to make running 225,000 SKU business very efficient. We are very impressed. We would like leverage that across our company. It will take us a year to probably do that. We do see it very possible. We are definitely going to merge the Web site now you\u2019re not going to get the PrimeGene product via an R&D system branded part on the Web site. Think it is a tree coming down from biotechne.com and you will either go one direction or the other and you\u2019re going to be looking at branded quality things under R&D systems or you may be looking at fighter brand if you\u2019re academia and some areas maybe in Novus maybe PrimeGene. But we\u2019re going to be very distinct and very careful how we do that and how we integrate. So on a way they can operate as they punch out for now and will be integrating them together for typical SEO type of initiatives over the coming year. Your question whether it will take two years or not, I am not sure that ever done but I think it will take us a full year to try and get something really out there and working cohesively together as a Bio-Techne type of umbrella system and it\u2019s going to take two years and there will be other initiative as well, that\u2019s all in first half and we believe it\u2019s imperative because just part right the long-term going forward. Brian Kipp : Definitely. And another follow-up, I know there has been a lot of thought and a lot of new product launches over the last year on the analytical instrumentation side to reduce consumer utilization and make it more efficient. Is that a pressure you guys are seeing on your biotechnology business? Is that a driver for you guys to augment that with ProteinSimple? Janney Capital Markets : Definitely. And another follow-up, I know there has been a lot of thought and a lot of new product launches over the last year on the analytical instrumentation side to reduce consumer utilization and make it more efficient. Is that a pressure you guys are seeing on your biotechnology business? Is that a driver for you guys to augment that with ProteinSimple? Chuck Kummeth :  I\u2019m trying to hear you. This question is breaking up. The line is getting goofy on me here. Would you may repeating it. Brian Kipp : Yes, can hear me, is it better now? Janney Capital Markets : Yes, can hear me, is it better now? Chuck Kummeth :  Try one more time I\u2019ll have -- fill in their answer if I can\u2019t. Brian Kipp : Any better.  Janney Capital Markets : Any better. Chuck Kummeth :  That\u2019s better. Brian Kipp : Analytical instrumentation, a lot of new product launches over the last couple years have focused on reducing reagent utilizations, just to naturally drive efficiencies. Is that something you are seeing as a pressure within your biotechnology franchise and why you\u2019re seeing some anemic or more anemic organic growth rates? Is that why you\u2019re augmenting your legacy reagent business with more analytical instrumentation products that you can synergize and drive top-line growth? Color around that would be helpful. Janney Capital Markets : Analytical instrumentation, a lot of new product launches over the last couple years have focused on reducing reagent utilizations, just to naturally drive efficiencies. Is that something you are seeing as a pressure within your biotechnology franchise and why you\u2019re seeing some anemic or more anemic organic growth rates? Is that why you\u2019re augmenting your legacy reagent business with more analytical instrumentation products that you can synergize and drive top-line growth? Color around that would be helpful. Chuck Kummeth :  Yes, I think you have to back up a little. What\u2019s driving thing is the need for activity right? ELISA is a great tool, it\u2019s been around for the five years uses a lot reagents we like it we believe it, but it\u2019s not that efficient and we look at -- kind of next generation ELISA, it is micro-fluidic. There are lot of different tool platforms coming out that are getting in the micro-fluidic and they\u2019re doing it not to lesser agent they\u2019re doing it because of lesser agent react -- big component activity. Now we don\u2019t equate the moderation with the value at all. And in fact we\u2019re well known for our -- our bioactivity in lot cases you can get lot more action out of lot less than our reagent  So you may pay a lot less money for a same amount of material from them versus us, but you\u2019ll get a lot more work done with us, because we just have work more bioactivity. So you have to be careful when you dive into this, because your question really I think is more around productivity what\u2019s going to help drive productivity and I think speed and accuracy are going to do that and I think solutions that use small amounts of reagents help drive that speed component I think so and that\u2019s where the design systems micro-fluidics happens to be that route. We are very instant in that and we should be being a very nice reagent selling. That set up is that why we\u2019re getting instrumentation again no, we\u2019re getting instrumentation because it\u2019s part of the solution we were trying to sell work with research system to give their help their needs for their experiments and help drive science all the way that\u2019s why we\u2019re working with more KOLs now. That\u2019s why we have a big name CTO that\u2019s why we have science advisory board now helping drive our directions and we\u2019re prioritizing which we go how deep in the stent cell, why and where are we going with it and then if we\u2019re going work with. And through all these collaborations if we come across new tools that change the game and factor not affect the user agents we\u2019re interested. Again we understand this process again as an example if you want to look at our big Western Blot shop, some see us we\u2019ll show you a lot of Western Blot. So ProteinSimple makes really nice sense for us and I can tell you our labs are screaming for tools themselves. So that\u2019s an indication we\u2019re really bullish on we\u2019re talking examples value to the industry. So I hope that answers kind of. Brian Kipp : Yes, definitely. Thank you.  Janney Capital Markets : Yes, definitely. Thank you. Operator :  There are no further questions in queue. Chuck Kummeth :  Little more time, give a minute. Operator :  (Operator Instructions) Chuck Kummeth :  Well, okay. Well, I want to thank you all for getting on this call and we intend to continue doing earnings call I know you appreciate for that and we\u2019re kind of doing what we said we do and come back to our come out strategy meeting last call. The team has done I think wonderful thing this year. We\u2019ve changed a lot things and we\u2019re really focused on changing management and our talent management and helping employees deal with all this and integrating the fine new teams that we have acquired and that\u2019s also going very well. So I\u2019d say stay tuned. We\u2019ll following our plan, we don\u2019t think what you down that all and we\u2019re glad you\u2019re with us. So thanks again and one last time I thank all our employees for a great year and we hope that the coming fiscal year 2015 will be as good or better. Thank you.",

Baird Justin Bowers \u2013 Leerink Swann Operator :  Good morning and welcome to the Bio-Techne earnings conference call for the first quarter of the full fiscal year 2015. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for questions following management\u2019s prepared remarks.  I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jim Hippel, Chief Financial Officer. Jim Hippel : Good morning, and thank you all for joining us as we discuss the results of our first quarter of fiscal year 2015. Also on the call today is Chuck Kummeth, Chief Executive Officer of Bio-Techne. Before we begin, let me briefly cover our Safe Harbor statement. Some of the remarks made during this conference call may be considered forward-looking statements. The company\u2019s 10-K for fiscal year 2014 identifies certain factors that could cause the company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made during this call. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of any new information or future events or developments. The 10-K as well as the company\u2019s other SEC filings are available on the company\u2019s website within its Investor Relations section. During the call, non-GAAP financial measures may be used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. Tables reconciling these measures to most comparable GAAP measures are available in the company\u2019s press release issued earlier this morning or on the Bio-Techne Corporation website at www.biotechne.com.  With that said, I will turn the call over to Chuck. Charles Kummeth : Thanks Jim. Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our first quarter earnings call. We started our fiscal year 2015 on solid footing with 3% overall organic growth and all of our segments reporting higher sales. Our team has executed very well in an environment where Europe\u2019s economy appears to be slowing and where here in the U.S. our academic market is still very price sensitive, given the multiple past years of lower NIH funding. We completed our previously announced acquisitions of Novus and ProteinSimple in quarter one, and together with prior acquisitions made in fiscal year 2014, the contributed another 24% of revenue growth on top of our base business, and they're building a foundation for future higher organic growth. The integration of these recent acquisitions has been a big focus for our teams early in fiscal year 2015, and they are progressing right on track. The legacy Novus and PrimeGene teams, together with the R&D Systems team have identified hundreds of products that are candidates for rebranding in different markets, such as (indiscernible) with academic, and/or different regions such as China versus North America and Europe to take advantage of each brand\u2019s value proposition in those markets. This rebranding is already happening and a full roll-out is expected in quarter two. Also with the acquisition of Novus, teams have already been established and are working to enhance the customer web experience with Bio-Techne. A powerful web interface was a key enabler for making Novus a supplier of choice in the antibody market and enabler for growth that we see as transferrable to the rest of Bio-Techne\u2019s portfolio. With Novus, we also recruited their founder, Karen Padgett, as VP of marketing, and she is spearheading both the branding and web-enabling projects. With the completion of our recent other acquisition, ProteinSimple, the company has a new reporting segment called protein platform. The protein platform segment expands the solutions that we can offer our customers by developing and commercializing proprietary systems and consumables for protein analysis. We see the potential for other instruments-based acquisitions, including the expect purchase of Cyvek, as discussed in prior calls, that fit this profile and could continue to build out this segment all while utilizing our existing\u2014the Asian portfolio to complete the system offering. In fact, we are in the process of screening a thousand antibodies for specific use with ProteinSimple\u2019s Simple Western product line.  As for ProteinSimple, we completed the acquisition at the end of July, and since then the team has not missed a beat with over 30% growth this quarter compared to the same quarter last year when it operated as an independent company. The 100th West instrument, the desktop version of our Simple Western line, was shipped in quarter one after only being introduced this past January, and we believe this is only the beginning. West is a desktop version of ProteinSimple\u2019s Simple Western product line which dramatically decreases the time of the traditional Western blot process within a lab with greater quality results. Our clinical control segment also continues to perform very well. Now with Bionostics as a part of this segment for almost a whole year \u2013 it was acquired last July in 2013 \u2013 we saw organic growth from this segment at 10% in quarter one. With this revenue growth also came growth in our adjusted earnings and operating cash flow with our base businesses holding the line on both gross and operating margins. We continue to reinvest wisely so that our investments bring strong returns to our shareholders. Jim, I\u2019ll turn it over to you for a deeper dive now into the financials. Jim Hippel : All right, thanks Chuck. I\u2019ll begin with an overview of our Q1 financial performance for the total company, then provide some color on each of our three segments. Before I get into details of our results, I want to reaffirm that our financial results for the quarter include three months of performance from the Novus acquisition, which occurred on July 1, and two months of performance from the ProteinSimple acquisition, which occurred July 31. At the total company level, we are reporting organic revenue growth using our standard methodology, therefore excluding the results of these recent acquisitions, as well as PrimeGene which was acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014, and excluding the impact of any year-over-year fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. However, for the protein platform segment, which consists entirely of the newly acquired ProteinSimple business, we are reporting organic revenue growth and operating margin on a pro forma basis as if we had owned ProteinSimple for all of fiscal year 2014 and 2015. We are doing this to provide insight into the performance of this segment.  Starting with the overall financial performance, we delivered a solid first quarter resulting in a 4% increase in adjusted earnings to $31.7 million with adjusted EPS at $0.85. Under GAAP, EPS was $0.64 in Q1 compared to $0.74 in Q1 of 2014, with the decrease due to acquisition-related costs and amortization of intangibles. On the top line, Q1 net sales were $108.5 million, an increase of 27% year-over-year and organic growth was 3%. Q1 reported net sales include 24% net growth from acquisitions and a nominal impact from foreign exchange. By geography, North America increased in the low single digits organically. Biopharma sales were particularly strong in North America with growth nearly 10%, partially offset by mid-single digit declines in academia. Europe declined in the mid-single digits primarily impacted by Germany, which experienced mid-teen declines. Meanwhile, China grew in the low teens. Although this was lower than growth rates experienced in Q4, China performed as anticipated given the slow release of research funds by the Chinese government due to auditing activities associated with the anti-corruption crackdown there. These activities are now winding down and we expect growth rates to accelerate the remainder of the year as funds get released. Moving on to the details of the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin came in at 72.1% in Q1, down 230 basis points from the prior year due to the product mix change associated with the recent acquisitions of Novus and ProteinSimple in July. Excluding acquisitions, gross margins were essentially flat compared to last year. Adjusted SG&A in Q1, excluding the impact of acquisitions, was 15.4% of revenue, approximately 100 basis points more than prior year, driven by higher stock compensation expense. Finally, R&D expense came in at 8.4% of revenue for the quarter, 60 basis points below prior year; however, after adjusting for the additional R&D expense and revenue from the recent acquisitions, R&D as a percent of revenue was essentially flat to last year. Looking at our results below operating income, net interest expense in Q1 was $125,000 compared to $567,000 of net interest income last year. This is as a result of the line of credit that was opened in July to partially fund the acquisition of ProteinSimple. Other minor year-over-year changes on the other expense income line are driven by foreign currency transactional gains and losses. Our adjusted effective tax rate in Q1 is essentially unchanged from last year at 30.9%. In terms of returning capital, we paid out $11.5 million in dividends to our shareholders in the quarter. Average diluted shares were 37,148,000 in Q1 \u2013 that\u2019s up 220,000 shares, or less than 1% from last year as a result of option dilution.  Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, the headline number is $35.7 million of cash generated from operations for the first quarter. That\u2019s up 10% over last year. Our Q1 investment in capital expenditures was $4.9 million, which included $3.6 million in leasehold improvements made by ProteinSimple for a new building to expand capacity. We ended the quarter with $131 million of cash and short term available for sale investments, down $233 million sequentially from the end of Q4 as a result of funding the July Novus and ProteinSimple acquisitions. Also in conjunction with funding these acquisitions, a line of credit with an initial $125 million draw was opened in July and ended the quarter with a balance of $112 million outstanding. That wraps up my comments on the total company performance for the first quarter. Now I\u2019ll walk you through the performance of our three business segments, starting with the new protein platform segment which resulted from the acquisition of ProteinSimple. As a reminder, ProteinSimple was acquired at the end of July, so reported results for this segment only include the months of August and September. In Q4, net sales for protein platforms was $12.9 million, all of it new to this segment and the total company this year. On a pro forma basis assuming ProteinSimple was owned for the entire quarter in both current and prior years, organic revenue grew to 33%. In the quarter, we saw extraordinary growth from both the Simple Western and Biologics product lines. Q1 adjusted operating margin was 20.2%. On a pro forma basis, protein platforms would have reported adjusted operating margin of 14.8% this quarter compared to 8.1% in Q1 of last year had ProteinSimple been owned for the entire quarter in both years. This is because of the timing of the acquisition close, the reported adjusted margin is higher than the pro forma due to the phasing of revenue versus expenses through the quarter. In the biotechnology segment, Q1 net sales was $81.5 million with a reported growth of 11% compared to last year and organic growth of 1%. In the quarter, we had solid growth in China and in the U.S. biopharma market, which was partially offset by a slowdown in Europe and continued cost pressures in the U.S. academic market. Adjusted operating income for this segment increased 3% in Q1 and adjusted operating margin was 51.6%, a decline of 440 basis points from prior year. The lower adjusted margin percentage is mostly attributable to a change in product mix associated with the acquisition of Novus. Turning now to our clinical control segment, where Q1 net sales were $14.1 million with reported growth of 13% compared to last year and organic growth of 10%. Q1 organic growth in this segment excludes the impact of Bionostics revenue generated through July 22, the acquisition date last year. Adjusted operating income for this segment increased 13% in Q1 and adjusted operating margin was 32.2%, essentially flat to the prior year. That concludes my prepared comments, and with that I will turn the call back over to the moderator to open the line for some questions. Elise, are you there? Operator : [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Paul Knight with Janney Capital. Please go ahead, sir. Bryan Kipp \u2013 Janney Capital : Hi guys, it\u2019s actually Bryan Kipp on behalf of Paul. Congrats on the quarter, and thanks for taking the questions. Just want to start off here on the protein platform. I think that the $12.9 million contribution, the 33% adjusted growth, did you guys see any pull-through in backlog? Was there something there? Any dynamics there on pull-through in backlog, or was revenue synergies a contribution there because of your existing platform? Just want some color there on the top line\u2014 Jim Hippel : Yeah, I understand. It\u2019s a little bit probably if you deduct it, it\u2019d be hotter than the S1, but there was no real pull-through or pull-ahead. It\u2019s just going very well. Charles Kummeth : Yeah, it was a bit early to say there was any kind of synergies there, and frankly their backlog is struggling to keep up with demand so they actually ended\u2014you know, they started the quarter and ended the quarter with fairly little backlog because they are producing the machines pretty much as fast as they can. Bryan Kipp \u2013 Janney Capital : Okay, and then strong op margin, the 20.2, similar gross margin dynamic there that we saw last year in the S1? And then I have one more quick one after that. Charles Kummeth : Yeah, keep in mind that that gross margin, it was artificially high because of the last two months that that was included for revenue versus expenses. They tend\u2014in insurance-type business, revenues tend to be a bit higher the last month of the quarter, so the pro forma numbers are a better go-forward margin rate to think about. Bryan Kipp \u2013 Janney Capital : Okay. Then on a geographic basis, just kind of want to think about benchtop time. I think some reagents peers of yours cited some strength in Europe, which was surprising. You guys said there was some soft weakness, especially in Germany. Is that all attributed to in your mind the weakness that we\u2019re starting to see at the end of 3Q here, or is it something that kind of worked its way through because of vacations and seasonality? Charles Kummeth : It\u2019s a bit seasonality, some timing. I was just over there personally in Germany and participated in our sales conferences over there, and it\u2019s really a softening in Germany particularly. It isn\u2019t really Europe, all across Europe. U.K. is actually pretty strong and is just, we think, a sense of what\u2019s coming. We\u2019re pretty quick on those leading indicators as a business, so reagents purchases happen pretty fast, up or down with the ebbs and flow of the markets. Bryan Kipp \u2013 Janney Capital : Okay, and you said you were just there, so the sentiment still hasn\u2019t really improved? Charles Kummeth : The sentiment has not improved. We were\u2014you know, we were expecting a better year this year, and I think all what\u2019s been going on in Europe here and Russia and stuff is definitely\u2014everybody\u2019s talking about it, right, but Germany is definitely the softest of the bunch. We\u2019re not seeing anything really too far off track for the rest of the year. Bryan Kipp \u2013 Janney Capital : All right, appreciate it. Thanks for the color. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Hewitt with Craig Hallum Capital. Please go ahead, sir. Matt Hewitt \u2013 Craig Hallum Capital : Morning gentlemen. Little help \u2013 you normally have provided this table in your press release that gives\u2014and I know that you gave some broad increases, decreases for the segments, but I\u2019m wondering if you could give us the specific numbers for the industrial, academic, Europe, China and Pacific Rim segments, or are you done with that going forward? Jim Hippel : Yeah, we\u2019re done with that going forward just because of the complexity of the business now, with the added segment and so forth. We are looking at it from a company-wide perspective geographically and not just by a particular segment. Also, given the variability to get that precise on a specific region, it\u2019s a bit problematic, so I think the directional numbers we provided are what we\u2019re prepared to give at this point. Matt Hewitt \u2013 Craig Hallum Capital : All right. China \u2013 you mentioned there was a bit of an issue this quarter with some of the funding. You expect that to pick up. Have you seen that already, or are you still waiting to see that? Charles Kummeth : We\u2019re still kind of waiting to see that, but that\u2019s what everyone\u2019s expectation is. We actually hit our plan in China for this quarter; we\u2019re doing fine, but we do think that things need to\u2014we were expecting acceleration. Our plan was a little more back end loaded, so this whole crackdown, I think has caught everyone but a little bit of surprise. I mean, other larger companies and more instrumentation have seen a couple quarters of softness, and we didn\u2019t really see that last quarter but now we\u2019re seeing a little. We think it will accelerate again, and overall we\u2019re looking pretty good. We\u2019ve got a lot of new things coming in China. We\u2019re still really building, in a real building mode there, so we have that going for us too. So we\u2019re still expanding with more people, more reps, more everything. Matt Hewitt \u2013 Craig Hallum Capital : Okay, so if I\u2019m hearing you correctly, you\u2019re still pushing ahead with your plans versus kind of holding off to wait and see when that funding is going to come back? Charles Kummeth : We\u2019re still pushing ahead. We still expect to see at least mid-20s for the year in growth. Matt Hewitt \u2013 Craig Hallum Capital : Okay, great. One last one from me and then I\u2019ll hop back in the queue. As far as the M&A landscape is concerned, I know that you guys have a number of targets that you\u2019re looking at. Has the recent volatility in the stock market created any opportunities for you, or is it kind of status quo waiting for the right fit? Charles Kummeth : Not really for us. Not a whole lot of surprises there. We\u2019re always hunting, but we\u2019re hunting smart. We\u2019re pretty busy digesting and integrating correctly too, so we\u2019re not in any hurry to rush. We have a strong pipeline, as I\u2019ve mentioned more than once, and we\u2019re talking all the time to people, potential partners. We expect to close on Cyvek very shortly here, as an example. Matt Hewitt \u2013 Craig Hallum Capital : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Amanda Murphy with William Blair. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am. JP McKim \u2013 William Blair : Hi everybody, it\u2019s actually JP in for Amanda. Thanks for taking the question. Mine was just more broadly about what you\u2019re thinking about for the remainder of the year. This quarter you grew 3% organically. What\u2019s kind of your internal target for fiscal \u201915? Charles Kummeth : Well, we don\u2019t really give guidance, so we\u2019ve talked about our goals. I think you can deduce we have goals to get to a little better than we\u2019re at \u2013 we\u2019re 3% organic growth, but we\u2019re not giving guidance. There\u2019s a lot of\u2014you know, we\u2019re coming from a year and a half ago, two years ago negative territory, so we\u2019re trying to rebuild and do things and get really a foundation set for much stronger organic numbers a year out, say, once these acquisitions are organic. I think from a year from now onward, it should be in the 8 to 12 for sure, if things all go well. Until then, I think it\u2019s in this\u20143 to 5 is probably what you can expect, and we\u2019ve been very clear about that. It could be better, could be worse given a lot of macro factors. I think without Europe and Germany this quarter, it\u2019d have been a little bit better. That was kind of a surprise. There\u2019s always something, right? It\u2019s biotech. JP McKim \u2013 William Blair : Yeah. What about this rebranding strategy that you kind of talked about? Is that going to be more a lot of private label, lower cost options, or what\u2019s going on there? Charles Kummeth : This is a really good question. This is actually a really good lever to where there could be better than expected upside in the core, because we\u2019re doing these acquisitions to try and create synergies. So the fact we\u2019re working 24/7 speed with ProteinSimple\u2019s systems in-house here, trying to qualify antibodies at the level of, like, a thousand of them, so we have new tuned antibodies for these platforms. When you talk to researchers and you ask about antibodies, they\u2019ll tell you. When you ask them, what\u2019s the biggest annoyance you have about buying antibodies? They\u2019ll say, frankly, mostly they don\u2019t work. We\u2019d sure like you buy them and they work, and antibodies are tough. It\u2019s a tough business \u2013 everybody knows this, and we think that as we are one of the leaders now for sure with Novus, we can tune whole portfolios, panels of different antibodies, (indiscernible) instruments for full solutions that were\u2014you know, customers can really be assured they\u2019re going to kind of work. That\u2019s going to be synergies, and that brand is going to be differentiated between R&D Systems versus Novus, all right, so we\u2019re going to have a tiered approach here with proteins and antibodies, with Novus being more this fighter level.  As you know, we have had some ankle-biting competition the last few years, and we are dealing with it; and I think between PrimeGene and Novus on board here, we\u2019re going to be able to launch and have different value propositions, also different support for everything. But we\u2019re going to be able to tier the approach from R&D Systems related quality, the usual support, integrity, et cetera, all the way to more of a lesser position where maybe academia is looking for a deal before they get to their final papers and such, and things we have talked about. Biotech pharma, we don\u2019t see a whole lot of change. They want the best, they want quality. We intend to keep building our portfolio of R&D Systems brand. We\u2019ve added hundreds of products again this quarter, so we\u2019re continuing to pound away. We added three more GMP-related proteins \u2013 we had 29 brand-new proteins enter our portfolio. We have 77 new small molecule products in Tocris. We have 83 new antibodies developed, so we\u2019re still acting as the leader we are with new products, and now we have the added advantage of trying to tier these into different brands or positions, where Karen Padgett from Novus is going to be an extreme help to us in terms of that positioning. Does that help? JP McKim \u2013 William Blair : Yes, it was very helpful. Can I say one more on clinical controls? Is there seasonality in that business, or was there anything in the cost or the sequential step down from Q4 and Q3 last year? Charles Kummeth : Well actually, remember last year we had a really, really good first quarter because there was some timing with our controls. I think we reported 13% in our core. I think given the integrated Bionostics being around 10, we\u2019re right on track. We\u2019re really happy with the results here and we don\u2019t see a whole lot of variance. That\u2019s one reason we bought Bionostics \u2013 you can put a ruler on this business over time. They always deliver, it\u2019s great cash flow, and we\u2019re right on track. JP McKim \u2013 William Blair : Great, thank you guys. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question, please press the number one key. Again, if there are any further questions, please press the number one key. Our next question comes from Jeff Elliott with Robert Baird. Please go ahead. Jeff Elliott \u2013 Robert W. Baird: Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. First one is on U.S. (indiscernible). Others have called out improvement in that (indiscernible) geography and end market. What are you seeing? It sounds like you\u2019re calling our mid-single digit decline (indiscernible). Charles Kummeth : Jeff, you\u2019re breaking up. I apologize \u2013 you\u2019re going to have to repeat that or change your location of your mic or something. Jeff Elliott \u2013 Robert W. Baird: Yes, what are you seeing in the U.S. academic market? Others have talked about strength in that market. You\u2019re mentioned a mid-single digit decline. What are you seeing there? Charles Kummeth : Yeah, we\u2019re seeing modest improvements. As you know, anywhere from five quarters ago through (indiscernible) quarters ago, we were negative double-digit, right? In the last quarter, we reported negative 8%. We\u2019re negative mid single digits now this quarter, so we\u2019re having\u2014we\u2019re seeing progress. We don\u2019t see it as a whole lot of, like, new spending coming off NIH funding. I think academia is still very timid in their spending. They\u2019re not through the pain yet in terms of their memory, but we are seeing some help from Fisher so there is some\u2014we\u2019re starting to see more accelerated help there by a point or two. So the direction is the right direction, and we continue and hope to see progress. Jeff Elliott \u2013 Robert W. Baird:  On Fisher, can you give any more color on how that relationship is progressing? Charles Kummeth : It\u2019s going great. As you know, we\u2019ve got 30 technical specialists that were trained here, and they\u2019re continuing to get stronger and deeper into our business, because we have thousands and thousands of products, right, so it\u2019s a hard bag to carry around. The rest of their army, of course, you do what you can. You manage in the field. Our field reps manage a lot of them, and you\u2019re trying to get their mind share. You do that by, one, being platinum \u2013 you\u2019re paying them, but the other is you try to spend time with them, you have webinars and seminars locally, you treat them with doughnuts. You do all of the above and you try to get them to really work on your behalf with their million product portfolio. And you know, it\u2019s coming together, it\u2019s working, and we have a great commercial team now led by some great experienced people, a lot of people with ex-Fisher experience, me included. We have relationships to the highest levels of the company, so we\u2019re all in and we\u2019re pushing them. I think they\u2019re very happy with things, how they\u2019re going, and we\u2019re making modest improvements quarter-on-quarter, so. Jeff Elliott \u2013 Robert W. Baird: Great. One last modeling question for me here \u2013 on FX, I guess you mentioned modest impact on the quarter, but the impact to margins, and how should we think about the FX impact over the next year? Jim Hippel : None of this has impacted our margins, so as I stated in my opening remarks, if you actually strip out all the acquisition activity, our baseline margins are amazingly flat, within 10 basis points flat year-over-year, both in our biotechnology segment as well as in our clinical control segment. Charles Kummeth : And that\u2019s really exciting too, when you think we had 3% organic growth. That\u2019s offsetting\u2014there\u2019s continued erosion in a lot of areas too, which we\u2019re still battling, which is the reason for these different strategies we\u2019re talking about. So you could think that with Fisher and the promotions and the other added promotions and different new commercial tactics we\u2019re doing, what you guys asked about when I came 18 months ago, is all this going to have a big impact to margins? And you\u2019re seeing it is, and we\u2019re really holding well. I think that just reflects strong brand in R&D Systems, primarily the strength in the biotech pharm market. It isn\u2019t about saving nickels, it\u2019s about quality, and (indiscernible) really offset, mitigate any potential margin erosion due to commercial tactics. Jeff Elliott \u2013 Robert W. Baird: Excellent, thanks guys. Charles Kummeth : It\u2019s something we\u2019re watching, for sure, especially with Fisher because the more they sell, they get\u2014they do really, really well, they get paid more, and we\u2019re watching it. So far, so good. Operator : Our next question comes from Dan Leonard with Leerink. Please go ahead, sir. Justin Bowers \u2013 Leerink Swann : Hi, good morning. This is Justin on for Dan. Just going back to China, was just curious if you saw any change in kind of the order pace throughout the quarter, especially towards the end \u2013 increase, decrease, kind of stable activity there. Charles Kummeth : Well, there\u2019s not a long lead time with our orders, so pretty much the order translates to revenue very, very quickly in our business. Having said that, as we closed out the quarter and into the early part of October here, our sales reps there were reporting a lot more activity, a lot more customer inquiry, et cetera, which again leads us to believe that some of the funding is starting to get released there. So the activity definitely picked up, but not in terms of order intake towards of the end of the quarter. Most of it would have represented\u2014would have been showing revenue. So when you look at it on a monthly basis, yeah, we did end the quarter with higher growth than we started the quarter, so I guess that would suggest that that order intake was higher. Jim Hippel : We also had a pretty good comp from last year \u2013 we had 38% growth in China this quarter last year. Justin Bowers \u2013 Leerink Swann : That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. Is most of the China business isolated to biotech, the biotech segment? Jim Hippel : Well, our biggest piece is definitely there, but even our protein platform segment now has about\u2014I had that number here. I want to say it\u2019s around 7 or 8% of the revenue is in China, and it\u2019s growing as fast there as it is here. Charles Kummeth : Yeah, it\u2019s growing just as fast. Now, if your question is more about academia versus biotech, then yeah \u2013 I think there\u2019s a lot of academia, obviously, in China, but it\u2019s very strong academia, it\u2019s well funded. Justin Bowers \u2013 Leerink Swann : Got it. Any comment on PacRim, or Japan specifically? Charles Kummeth : Japan had a great quarter. They were up near\u2014close to 10% gross. (Indiscernible) in PacRim, a lot of timing issues, and again it was very strong last year, so it\u2019s mid-single digit, as was reported by Jim. Jim Hippel : The overall PacRim was in the low single digits, but Japan did particularly strong. Justin Bowers \u2013 Leerink Swann : Okay, great. The just\u2014go ahead? Charles Kummeth : We do expect that to accelerate here as well. We think there\u2019s some timing there in that. Justin Bowers \u2013 Leerink Swann : All right. Then maybe just a little more color on the 2Q launch for Novus and PrimeGene, and kind of maybe scope of the portfolio and timing? Charles Kummeth : Well as I mentioned, we\u2019re working on hundreds of things \u2013 antibodies for the West machines. We\u2019re busy requalifying proteins that were more commodity-level R&D Systems to be rebranded as Novus. We\u2019re in the dozens of those at this point, and they are actually out. We are already selling some PrimeGene made products as R&D Systems brand \u2013 they\u2019re already on the catalog and selling. So it\u2019s all coming. It\u2019s never enough for me, but this is unfortunately a business that is sold by\u2014you know, you have to have a catalog and a portfolio of many, not a few, so you have to get to critical mass. We\u2019re getting there. We\u2019re definitely on track. I would say in terms of the integration schedule, Novus has been spectacular. As you know, we\u2019ve got Karen on board. The other general manager there is on board here, is also someone I\u2019ve known from my Thermo Fisher days. We know each other well, he knows our model real well, so we\u2019re moving very quickly. We\u2019re in the midst of actually harmonizing and integrating distribution in the PacRim \u2013 that\u2019s coming together very, very well. We have shared histories there as well, so we see potential upside in not only just Japan but the rest of Asia. We\u2019re direct in China, so it\u2019s a matter of combining, getting teams working together \u2013 the ProteinSimple team there which is growing and doing very well along with our core team out of Shanghai. Justin Bowers \u2013 Leerink Swann : Okay, and just one last quick one. On capex, I know you guys were expecting a bump in capex this year, but are we going to see that moderate through the rest of the year, I guess on a quarterly basis, or do you expect those levels to sustain? Jim Hippel : Yeah, Justin, I think it will fluctuate a bit throughout the year. Again, the major piece of our capex this quarter actually was a result of our new acquisition, ProteinSimple, which of course we knew about going in, where they actually moved into a new building this quarter to expand their capacity, so the lion\u2019s share of that capex this quarter was associated with that. We also had some building activity for a facility in the U.K. that requires some expansion that was in our plan, and that will start to occur in the second half of the fiscal year. I expect there will be a bit of a dip in capex and then it will kind of get back up to the levels we\u2019re seeing right now. Charles Kummeth :  The cost in the Tocris U.K. will actually span two budget cycles. We did that on purpose, but it\u2019s expensive stuff doing this high-end chemistry there, so we\u2019ll get started on that second half. We\u2019ve literally been out of capacity. That\u2019s been a great business and growing also very faithfully in mid to upper single digits, and it\u2019s actually past time to make that investment so we\u2019re working on it now. Justin Bowers \u2013 Leerink Swann : Good problem to have. Thanks a lot. Operator : Our final question comes from Paul Knight with Janney Capital. Please go ahead, sir. Bryan Kipp \u2013 Janney Capital : Hi guys, it\u2019s Bryan again. Just wanted to do a quick follow-up on the Novus commentary you guys gave earlier on the ecommerce roll-out and leveraging your existing platform. Are you launching beta \u2013 I don\u2019t know if you had announced this or went into it in depth here, but are you launching beta in the U.S. for broader Bio-Techne, and then what\u2019s your plans on launching it ex-U.S. as you kind of continue to scale up that ecommerce channel? Charles Kummeth : Yeah, we were busy and kind of, I would say, mid-project on an overall comprehensive Bio-Techne website to improve the user experience. Now with Novus and ProteinSimple, we\u2019re really looking at that and now we\u2019ve got, I\u2019ll say, a better pro with Karen coming on board, and Novus\u2019 site is fantastic and their overall digital platforms and how they enable and drive content through their site is also, I think, amazing, another reason we wanted this deal. They are working through 60 suppliers, 200,000-plus products, and they\u2019ve got on-time delivery as good as ours, and we make everything we sell. So we want to integrate kind of all that, so we\u2019re taking a fresh look at what we do there. We\u2019re probably expanding the R&D site first, I think, enabling with some of the tools and tricks that come with the Novus people, and then we\u2019ll be expanding the Bio-Techne level umbrella second. And think about that as that\u2019s where we\u2019ll improve the SEO, so the search engine capability, so now our ultimate vision is that customers will be online searching, looking for proteins, and get all the varieties for the different tiered brands they have (indiscernible), so they walk away shopping and coming up with something. So it will take quite a few months to get all that put together. I don\u2019t see a beta for things coming out on the R&D site improvement until probably spring-ish, in that range, but we\u2019re right in the middle of trying to figure that out with the new team from Novus involved with our IT team. So more on that in the coming quarters, but all good stuff. We\u2019re actually seeing great activity on our site as well as others. We\u2019ve been doing a lot more metrics and measuring and surveying on our site, given with Karen on board and trying to figure out what else we should look at. Boy, the data is looking pretty good. Our site is actually working fairly well. Bryan Kipp \u2013 Janney Capital : Okay, thanks for the color. Just a last one, not to beat it up, but China again \u2013 your confidence on pacing. Do you have any view on whether it might be sort of a budget flush end of the year for them, or any conviction into the strength to start next year? Is it something that you guys remain positive on with underlying dynamics going on there? Charles Kummeth : Yeah, well man, I\u2019m praying just like everybody else. If there was ever a table being set for a budget flush, it was this one in China coming up, so we\u2019ll see. I\u2019m sure all our peers are hoping and praying for the same thing. You know, you would say historically, given the way they act as a market and what\u2019s happened with the crackdown, everybody getting kind of lean this last quarter or two, it should occur; but it\u2019s hard to say. We don\u2019t know how deep this crackdown will go either, but if it does lift and people get happier again, then I think you\u2019ll see that. But I think we\u2019ve got to see more happen on the political front there, probably. Jim Hippel : The good news is that we know in their five-year plan, the funding is there. Charles Kummeth : Yeah, it\u2019s a matter of timing. It\u2019s there. Jim Hippel : And when do they release the floodgates. Charles Kummeth : It\u2019s going to pop sometime. Bryan Kipp \u2013 Janney Capital : Yes, sure. Appreciate it again. Operator : Again ladies and gentlemen, if there are any further questions, please press the number one key.  There are no more questions in queue. Charles Kummeth : Well okay, just want to thank everybody for being on. I know we have quite a few people on, more than usual, so if you\u2019ve got a last question you can give it a try, or you can call us offline and have a more private question as well on certain topics. But anyway, thank you all. We think it was a very reasonable quarter for us. We\u2019re more or less on track. We\u2019re pretty excited about how the integration is going. We\u2019re still hunting for more things to check off, more boxes for our ultimate vision, which most of you know of. We\u2019ll be back next quarter to tell you more about how that goes with our progress. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference. You may all disconnect.",

Baird Matt Tiampo - Craig Hallum Capital Bryan Kipp - Janney Capital Amanda Murphy - William Blair Operator : Good morning and welcome to the Bio-Techne earnings conference call for the second quarter of the fiscal year 2015. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the call will be open for questions following management\u2019s prepared remarks. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jim Hippel, Chief Financial Officer. Jim Hippel : Good morning and thank you for joining us as we discuss the second quarter results of fiscal year 2015. Also on the call this morning is Chuck Kummeth, Chief Executive Officer of Bio-Techne. Before we begin, let me briefly cover our Safe Harbor statement. Some of the remarks made during this conference call may be considered forward-looking statements. The company\u2019s 10-K for fiscal year 2014 identified certain factors that could cause the company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements made during this call. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of any new information or future events or developments. The 10-K as well as the company\u2019s other SEC filings are available on the company\u2019s website within its Investor Relations section.  During the call, non-GAAP financial measures may be used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. Tables reconciling these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available on the company\u2019s press release issued earlier this morning or on the Bio-Techne Corporation website at www.biotechne.com.  One other item before we get started, and as I mentioned last quarter, please note that the commentary today regarding the total company\u2019s Q2 organic growth by end market and geography do not include performance of protein platforms. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Chuck. Charles Kummeth : Thanks Jim, and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us today for our second quarter earnings call. We continue to develop and implement our plan of moving our core organic growth into the mid-single digit range. In Q2, I am pleased to report that we achieved 4% organic growth. Equally important, the growth was widespread throughout the company, growing organically in each of our major regions - North America, Europe and China, in both of our major markets, biotech pharma and academia and government, and in each of our reportable business segments. Of particular note, Europe returned to organic growth despite the currency headwinds and economic uncertainty that plagues the region, and China returned to last year\u2019s track record of growing north of 25%, this despite the ongoing anti-corruption audits being performed by the Chinese government that are still impacting the release of research funds there. Here in North America, we continue to see steady improvements in our academia and government markets, achieving positive growth for the first time in many quarters. We believe this is the result of executing our strategies, including expanding our commercial reach by partnering with the Fisher channel, and second launching fighter brands that offer more choice to these customers, both of which are starting to take hold. It is important to note that the R&D Systems brand remains the premier brand under which we develop the highest quality and bio-active products which differentiate themselves from our fighter brand product lines. Always mindful of our bottom line, we also grew profitably in Q2 with both adjusted earnings and operating cash flows increasing by double digits in the second quarter over last year. Our core growth in operating margins continued to hold steady versus last year, even with the investments we continue to make in our people, our systems, and our website that will enable us to support what we believe will be a much larger company in the future.  Speaking of our people, I\u2019m extremely proud of the work they have done and continue to do to integrate our most recent acquisition, realizing tremendous benefits for our customers and ultimately to our shareholders. These include but are not limited to our teams from PrimeGene, Novus and R&D Systems working together to align our brands and products into new offerings, giving the customer more choice in bio-active reagents and increasing the chance that their product needs will be supplied by Bio-Techne.  We continue to make good progress with our commercial partner, Fisher. Nine months ago when we launched the partnership, we received about 20 to 30 orders a day. It\u2019s now well into the hundreds. The market reach Fisher gives us is one key component how we have moved to positive organic growth again in the academic and government segment. Our team from R&D Systems, ProteinSimple and Novus are developing the only antibodies that are qualified for use on the game-changing Simple Western platform. Since the acquisition, we have now qualified over 600 antibodies for the Simple Western platform and expect thousands more over the coming years. Our teams from ProteinSimple, CyVek, and R&D Systems are developing qualified assays to expand our commercial offerings of solutions using the Simple Plex platform, Ella, the recently rebranded immunoassay CyVek instrument. We are extremely excited about this platform and currently have over 50 assays developed and ready to commercialize with Ella. Both ProteinSimple and CyVek teams are working aggressively to find manufacturing and commercial synergies that will accelerate the launch of Ella and thus immunoassay solutions for our customers. Again, binding content with instruments in a proven full solution for the customer is one of our core new strategies. Also, our teams from both Novus and R&D Systems continue to leverage their collective experience, IT and marketing resources to enhance the Bio-Techne web experience and ecommerce capability for our customers. Our clinical controls division continues to meet our objectives, both from a financial and product portfolio point of view. We consider Bionostics fully integrated at this point and now are turning our focus toward other acquisition synergies within the biotech division. Our employees are very busy executing the integration activities described, but busy with a purpose, a mission and determination in building a great company that works together to provide unique and complete solutions to barriers our customers face in driving new life science discoveries and knowledge. This is what motivates us and what will drive us in achieving our long-term goals. Before we turn the call over to questions, I\u2019ll ask Jim to provide some details on the financials for the second quarter. Jim? Jim Hippel : Thanks, Chuck. I will provide an overview of our Q2 financial performance for the total company, and then I\u2019ll provide some color on each of our three segments. Before I get into the details of our results, I want to address two events that occurred in the second quarter which materially impact our financials as compared to the prior year.  The first event was the early November acquisition of CyVek, a company in which we previously had a minority ownership position of just under 20%. Since this transaction was conducted in stages, Bio-Techne is required to re-measure our previously held equity interest in CyVek and its acquisition date fair value, and recognize any resulting gain or loss in earnings. Consequently, a gain of $8.3 million was triggered in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 as a result of the company\u2019s purchase of the remaining 80% interest in CyVek. The fair market value was determined based on consideration paid in Q2 of $60 million plus a potential earn-out payment of up to $35 million based on CyVek attaining certain revenue targets over the 30-month period following the closing. This gain is not considered income for tax purposes, thus it drops straight to the bottom line net earnings for Q2 and positively impacted GAAP earnings per share by $0.22. In our adjusted net earnings and adjusted EPS, we have removed the impact of this gain to allow for a more transparent comparison to historical results and a more helpful assessment of ongoing operating performance. With regard to CyVek\u2019s operational results, these were included in Bio-Techne\u2019s consolidated financials for the month of November and December, and it impacted the company\u2019s second quarter GAAP reported EPS by negative $0.03 and adjusted EPS by negative $0.02. We expect this run rate to continue for the next several quarters as full-scale commercialization, manufacturing and services activities for the Simple Plex platform ramp up. The second event that materially impacted Bio-Techne\u2019s financial results in Q2 was not company-specific but rather a macro event of a strengthening U.S. dollar that impacted many, if not most companies that sell products outside the United States in local currencies. As a reminder, approximately 28% of our biotech segment revenues are generated in Europe and sold in European-based currencies. With the rapid rise of the U.S. dollar versus these currencies in the second quarter, Bio-Techne faced headwinds that impacted revenue by negative 2% and EPS by negative $0.02 when compared to the second quarter of fiscal year \u201914. Assuming foreign exchange rates do not materially change from where they stand today, we expect the effect over the next several quarters compared to prior year to be approximately double the impact we had in Q2.  Now I\u2019ll discuss the overall financial performance for the second quarter. We delivered a solid quarter, resulting in a 10% increase in adjusted earnings to $30.3 million with adjusted EPS of $0.82. Under GAAP, EPS was $0.89 in Q2 compared to $0.68 in Q2 of 2014, with the increase including the previously mentioned gain on our CyVek investment partially offset by other acquisition-related costs and amortization of intangibles. On the top line, Q2 reported sales were $111.9 million, an increase of 33% year-over-year and organic growth of 4%. Q2 sales included 31% from acquisitions and a negative 2% impact from foreign exchange.  By geography, North America increased in the low single digits organically. Bio-pharma sales were strong in North America with growth in the high single digits, while the academia/government market experienced slight positive growth. Europe grew organically in the low single digits with strong academic growth partially offset by research project timing in the regional bio-pharma market, particularly in Germany. China experienced exceptional organic growth in the high 20\u2019s despite the ongoing Chinese government anti-corruption audit activities that are slowing the release of research funds there. In the Pacific Rim, growth was in the high single digits. Moving on to the details of the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin came in at 71% in Q2, down 170 basis points from the prior year due to the product mix change associated with the acquisitions of Novus and ProteinSimple in July. Excluding acquisitions, gross margins were essentially flat compared to last year. Adjusted SG&A in Q2 excluding the impact of acquisitions was 17.3% of revenue, approximately 140 basis points more than the prior year driven by higher stock compensation expense. R&D expense came in at 9% of revenue for the quarter, 40 basis points below the prior year. Looking at our results below operating income, net interest expense in Q2 was $266,000 compared to $545,000 of net interest income last year as a result of a line of credit that was opened in July to partially fund the acquisitions of ProteinSimple and Cyvek. The other expense income line includes this net interest expense as well as the $8.3 million gain recorded on our existing investment in CyVek, as explained in my opening comments. Our adjusted effective rate in Q2 was 30.3%, down 100 basis points from second quarter of last year due to acquisition mix and tax planning activities.  In terms of returning capital, we paid out $11.9 million in the form of dividends to our shareholders in the quarter. Average diluted shares were 37,211,000 in Q2, up 283,000 shares or less than 1% from last year as a result of option dilution. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, the headline number is $35.7 million of cash generated from operations for the second quarter - that\u2019s up 14% over the prior year. Our Q2 investment in capital expenditures was $3.1 million. We ended the quarter with $140 million of cash and short-term available for sale investments, up $9 million sequentially from the end of Q1. The remainder of free cash flow from the quarter was mostly used to pay dividends and partially fund the acquisition of CyVek. In conjunction with funding the CyVek acquisition, our outstanding line of credit increased from $112 million at the end of Q2 to $144 million at the end of Q2, and we also booked a $35 million long-term debt obligation with regards to the potential earn-out payment for CyVek attaining certain future revenue targets, which we view as likely to occur. That wraps up my comments on the total company performance for the second quarter. Now I\u2019ll walk you through the performance of each of our three business segments, starting with the protein platform segment which now includes our recent acquisition of CyVek in addition to ProteinSimple, which was acquired last July. In Q2, net sales for protein platforms were $20.3 million, already due to this segment in the total company this year. On a pro forma basis assuming ProteinSimple and CyVek were owned for the entire quarter in both current and prior years, organic revenue for the protein platform segment grew 33%. In the quarter, we saw extraordinary growth from both the biologics and Simple Western product lines. Simple Plex, the rebranded tech line acquired via CyVek, reported nominal revenue in the second quarter as the marketing activities and commercial integration with ProteinSimple were preparing its flagship instrument, Ella, for a full-scale launch in Q3. Q2 adjusted operating margin for this segment was 17.6%. As an independent company, ProteinSimple reported 11.8% adjusted operating margin in the quarter ended December 31, 2013. Turning to the biotechnology segment, Q2 net sales were $78 million with reported growth of 10% compared to last year and organic growth of 5%. In the quarter, we had a recovery back to growth in the academic and government markets in both the U.S. and Europe. The U.S. bio-pharma market remained strong and China\u2019s revenue accelerated back to growth rates we saw last year. Adjusted operating for this segment increased 3% in Q2 and adjusted operating margin was 50.3%, a decline of 375 basis points from prior year. The lower adjusted margin percentage is mostly attributable to a change in product mix associated with the acquisition of Novus along with infrastructure investments. Our clinical control segment had Q2 net sales of $13.7 million with both reported and organic growth of 2% compared to last year. Revenue in Q2 was impacted by timing of a shipment to a large OEM customer. Year-to-date, organic growth is 6% and this growth rate is more indicative of what we expect from business segment over both the intermediate and longer term. Adjusted operating income for this segment increased 4% in Q2 and adjusted operating margin was 27.9%, an increase of 50 basis points in the prior year. That concludes my prepared comments, and with that I\u2019ll turn the call over to the moderator to open the line for some questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Paul Knight at Janney Capital. Please go ahead. Paul Knight : Good morning. Could you talk about what was the adjusted op margin, Chuck, for the consolidated entity? Charles Kummeth : Adjusted op margin? Paul Knight : EBITDA margin? Charles Kummeth : I think overall, we\u2019re just under 40% total, all-in. We\u2019re looking forward--you know, as we do acquisitions and we\u2019re integrating them, we\u2019re gaining some back. We expect to be in that range, low-40s going forward. It\u2019s a combination of the mix with our core business. In our core business, our margins are virtually flat. We\u2019ve been watching that very carefully with our investments, along with our operating promotions and competitive strategies, and overall our core has done pretty well. We\u2019ve done a pretty good job of taking cost out in the biotech area, which is our biggest business as well.  We\u2019re getting some leverage - I mean, we had some actual leverage in clinical controls. We actually increased our margins off of just the scale of business more than anything else. Jim Hippel : There will be fluctuations with timing of investments versus revenue. I think it\u2019s important to remind you that year-to-date, our op margins, our adjusted operating margins are 41%, and that\u2019s probably more indicative of what we see going forward. Paul Knight : And in protein platform, was that 33% organic for the entire segments combined? Charles Kummeth : Yeah. CyVek basically had nominal revenue in the quarter, so for the most part it\u2019s ProteinSimple. Paul Knight : And then you had mentioned earlier in the call that you have 600 qualified antibodies for the ProteinSimple. Does that mean that the catalog is now out? Can you talk about that is going to impact the sales line, this 600 qualified you mentioned earlier? Charles Kummeth : Sure. You know, our goal along with buying instruments businesses is to find leverage, synergies with our content, so what we had in mind from the very beginning was to qualify antibodies because we have a large portfolio of them ourselves. We also through Novus have the largest portfolio really of anyone in the world, and we\u2019re looking through those and we\u2019re trying to find the runners and the ones that people are most interested in, and qualifying them on this instrument. What that means is we\u2019ll do the [indiscernible] for the customer, so we will figure out the dilution factor and the levers you pull to make these things actually run at their best performance on this instrument without wasting content that the customer [indiscernible] has to do.  This is done online, so we have a trademark certification symbol, so when you look up and you search for the reagents online on our website, you will see which ones are certified for this platform and which ones are not. That\u2019s a big promotion - we\u2019re just starting it. I mean, the ink is just drying on all this stuff right now. So the catalog is virtually online, as they are all now, and there\u2019s roughly 600 that are certified ready to go and are for sale. We have actually uploaded 135,000-plus antibodies on both the Novus site and the R&D Systems site, so we\u2019re well ahead of, I think, our original schedule for integrating Novus and the antibody portfolio into the norm here. So this phase is next with that ProteinSimple piece, and on to Ella next. Paul Knight : Lastly, I guess those number of qualified antibodies, how many were qualified, let\u2019s say, end of September? Charles Kummeth : End of--well, we started roughly in August, probably 200-some maybe in September. Paul Knight : Okay, thank you. Charles Kummeth : I will make one comment. We want to do 1,000, and it\u2019s harder than you think. We\u2019ve kind of indicated what customers have been telling us, that it\u2019s hard to make antibodies work as advertised on all these kind of platforms, and we discovered that firsthand as well and we\u2019re experts in both the content and the instrument, obviously. So we\u2019re at 600. Over the coming years, we\u2019ll probably get into thousands, but customers are right - you\u2019ve really got to do some work here to make these things work the way you want, and they\u2019re not all created equal. So my team was a little bit down, thinking golly, they missed the 1,000 antibody goal. I was actually kind of happy because they vindicated what customers have been saying. So hopefully we can do that heavy lifting for the customer and that\u2019s just going to create a whole other layer of value for us. Paul Knight : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Justin Bowers with Leerink. Please go ahead, sir. Justin Bowers : Hi, good morning. Could you elaborate on some of the strengths you saw, or the rebound I guess in Europe and U.S. academic, and whether or not there was any benefits from a big bolus of orders, and kind of what you\u2019re thinking for expectations in those segments for the remainder of the year? Charles Kummeth : Sure. Europe is still a mixed bag. We talked last quarter about the softness in Germany in particular, and it\u2019s still soft for us. It\u2019s even a little soft in France. The rest of Europe is really okay. The U.K. is doing great. So it\u2019s a little bit mix. It is timing. Academia was stronger overall there, but timing was more just the bio-pharma. We got a lot of large accounts, and that\u2019s kind of bouncing back. It\u2019s very similar to last year - you know, we had a lot of negativity in our immunoassays and our [indiscernible], and it bounced back very nicely this year through timing of larger orders with these larger companies. So there is a bit of that we\u2019re all learning here as well to deal with, so that kind of covers that. In terms of the rebound here in the academia and government, I think Fisher is a big component of that. We\u2019re still trying to measure where it is all coming in, where it\u2019s all landing. It\u2019s kind of hard to measure, to be honest, processing hundreds of thousands of accounts, and I think the progress in our website--you know, we have the IT team from Novus on staff. We have the head of the company from Novus is our head of marketing now, and she is doing a brilliant job on working on our website and our ecommerce overall here, and that\u2019s also helping. We\u2019re getting more activity in our website, so there\u2019s some of that. But I would have to say the biggest impact, I think, is just the incremental steady improvements in growth via Fisher. They\u2019ve been doing a great job for us, and as we learn how to help each other more and work together, it\u2019s been beneficial. Again, a lot of these academic institutions, they just have that big blue Fisher button for the lab stock online, and being part of that internal Fisher [indiscernible] to these universities is a major plus, and we\u2019re at the platinum level so we get special treatment, and we\u2019re really happy to have that. So all told, I think last year we talked about every quarter was negative double digits. Last quarter, we were negative 6, I think, and this quarter now combined we\u2019re up 1, almost flat on just academia alone, so a pretty good move in the right direction. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be overnight, high single digits or anything, but it\u2019s just incremental steady progress and those are the reasons. Over time as we get more content and we have more full solutions, and I just talked about the certified antibodies, all this is going to add to the core and it\u2019s going to help. Justin Bowers : Okay. Then in terms of China, are you still making investments there or do you think you\u2019re currently scaled properly, given some of the government issues there? Charles Kummeth : We\u2019re probably in the third inning in China. We\u2019re just getting started. We\u2019ve grown from 12 people to 100 in the just under two years I\u2019ve been here. Most of the sales people are PrimeGene, the acquisition we did there that we went from roughly that doze to 30 or so in the commercial side, and now we also have a ProteinSimple team there as well, so all told about 100. We\u2019re looking for other assets and investments there as well. We\u2019ll keep building out the team. It is a big set of complex channels to deal with. We have bounced back nicely. We never really were overly impacted too much by the audit scenarios there. I think it\u2019s a much bigger issue for instant players than us. So we\u2019re working hard and it\u2019s going pretty well. As we go forward, we\u2019re building out a new factory with PrimeGene and that\u2019s underway. We\u2019re looking at another factory in Suzhou for other content strategies that I won\u2019t elaborate on today, but we have a lot of things up our sleeve here for going bigger in China. We\u2019re going where the action is. Whether we hold a full 25% growth for the full year, we\u2019ll see. We\u2019re still kind of on track for 20-plus for sure. It should be better than most anybody else out there, given our teams, and we\u2019re pretty bullish.  When you\u2019re in the content space in this whole area in China, it\u2019s very nascent. Stem cell research is a good example. It\u2019s just--you know, and tissue research, it\u2019s just exploding there and it\u2019s just early days. Justin Bowers : All right, great. Then any expectations on CyVek contribution this year, or Ella, and content that you can share? Charles Kummeth : Yeah, we have a kind of 30-month fuse here on hitting the next milestone, so that\u2019s kind of the guidance we\u2019re giving. Since we\u2019re about eight months or so ahead of forecasts or schedule on picking up control, you can assume that we\u2019re going to be ahead of schedule on the launch as well. I think we\u2019ll be probably at between the million and $2 million run rate within the year here, within a quarter or two - we\u2019ll see. The launch is just starting. We\u2019re really excited about the naming, the branding. Everything about it looks great, looks pretty nice. The content is ready to go for a good launch. We have the right set of larger customers that are very interested. Again, long term we\u2019re hoping this becomes a companion diagnostic standard. It\u2019s getting more momentum and more interest the more we work with it, and now we\u2019ve got a 100-person commercial sales force with ProteinSimple to actually help take it up. We don\u2019t have to reinvent the wheel here with the acquisition of CyVek, so they\u2019re all very excited about it. The training is all completed, form, fit and factor is done, colors, everything is done, promotion. So the launch begins and we\u2019re hopeful of good news for you in a quarter or two here. Justin Bowers : Great, thanks a lot. Charles Kummeth : So soon we\u2019ll know how to sell new instrument platforms on ProteinSimple, so we\u2019re counting on big things. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Elliott with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. Jeff Elliott : Good morning, guys. Thanks for the questions, and thanks for the color on the core margins. It\u2019s good to hear that those are basically stable. My question really is on the acquired businesses across all the segments here. How should we think about the margins on those businesses? I guess the big one here is ProteinSimple, but how should we think about the acquired margins over the next few quarters? What\u2019s the trajectory there? Charles Kummeth : Yeah, well as Jim pointed out, year-on-year we\u2019ve gone from 11 and change to near-18 on ProteinSimple, so they\u2019re ramping pretty fast as we build scale. We\u2019ve always said that long term, that business should get into the mid-30s for op margins, in that range. It won\u2019t probably get all the way to content, but we\u2019re talking about a platform that\u2019s roughly 70% gross margin, and over time as we have more consumables go with that business, the mix is going to improve it some. The IT, we think is very sound - that\u2019s the key to all this, of course. Most instrument businesses are in the 50s and so on, so we\u2019re pretty bullish to get to the low to mid-30s here within the next year or two. Jim Hippel : Yeah, and Jeff, all this share data will be in the Q as well, but if you actually pull out the CyVek dilutive impact this quarter, the adjusted op margins for ProteinSimple would have been north of 20%, so about a doubling of their op margins just in one year. So they\u2019re on a very, very nice trajectory, and as Chuck mentioned, our longer term models have them hitting 30% range, so they\u2019re definitely on that track. Jeff Elliott : Got it, that\u2019s great. CyVek, the dilutive impact, what do you think that will be over the next couple of quarters? Is that still in that negative $0.02 range? Jim Hippel : Yeah, I\u2019d say for the next couple quarters, although we do expect there to be some revenues ramping up here in the coming quarters. There\u2019s continuous investment that\u2019s going right along with it, so we see it being dilutive for the next couple quarters but our goal all along is for that to become accretive after about a year, [indiscernible]. Jeff Elliott : Got it. Then Chuck, just big picture update on the competitive environment. You\u2019ve made a lot of [indiscernible] here over the past 18 months on building up the company, but I guess have you seen a competitive response? What\u2019s the state of the competitive environment right now? Charles Kummeth : I think--you know, we all just came back from [indiscernible]. I think everyone would agree that things are looking pretty good overall in this industry. Currency and the world stuff is the biggest drag, in particular when you\u2019ve got Japan going from the high 80\u2019s to near $1.20. It is going to affect the buying and purchasing power of distributors in Japan, so we\u2019re seeing that.  Other competitive issues I guess reacting to us, we are seeing some. I mean, the Abcams of the world, we see them noticing us more; but overall in general, we\u2019re very unique and most of our competitors are very small. I worry more about their narrow focus and what they do independently, so it\u2019s kind of a mixed bag. We don\u2019t--we\u2019re not really out there worrying about what a Thermo Fisher might do or something like that. We\u2019re mostly partnering with these bigger guys, thinking of them more like partners as well. We\u2019re doing a lot of things with Thermo [indiscernible] future. We have projects with virtually everyone out there because we make do for everything, so. But I do worry about these smaller companies being stronger. I always worry about what\u2019s the next Lenovo in this industry in China coming after, because there\u2019s a lot of new entrants, a lot of new things coming in China, and we\u2019ve got to watch that one. But for the most part, nothing that I would tell you that we need to re-look at our strategy. Our strategies, I think are working. I think they\u2019re the right strategies. I think we\u2019re going to continue them. We just finished this year\u2019s version of our strategic plan, and other than adding a new chapter for protein platforms, nothing much has changed for now. I think we\u2019re most excited about just getting back to some positive growth here in the academia area, and just hoping like everyone else that the NIH funding continues to improve. Should it not, we\u2019re going to be going after share with these strategies we\u2019re talking about. Jeff Elliott : Great, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks. Operator : Our final question comes from Matt Tiampo with Craig Hallum Capital. Please go ahead. Matt Tiampo : Hi guys, it\u2019s Matt Tiampo in for Matt Hewitt. We were just curious on a couple things quickly. First, how is the rebranding of CyVek to Ella progressing, and what\u2019s the response been like from your customer base? Charles Kummeth : Well, the launch is really just happening, so it\u2019s too early to tell. We looked at some other names, and Ella was the winner, and I really like it. Everyone is just in love with it. It has a look and feel - we\u2019ve got the color scheme of the West. It looked like brother and sister out there, it\u2019s all by design. This group knows how to market stuff, they know how to sell stuff, so we\u2019re pretty pumped to see what happens here. So it\u2019s early. Next quarter would be the better time to answer that question with some initial data, but the ink isn\u2019t even dry on this stuff. Jim Hippel : The early indication is actually from the ProteinSimple sales force themselves, which have embraced this new product line and are just absolutely excited to get out there and start selling it. Charles Kummeth : It\u2019s really been positive, to the point where we\u2019re trying to remind everybody, let\u2019s not forget about West now too, guys. Matt Tiampo : Great, that\u2019s great to hear. Second thing we were a little bit curious on, did you see an impact last week from the storms in the northeast? Charles Kummeth : That\u2019s a good question, and yes we did. But you might remember this coming quarter a year ago, all of us suffered about five days of loss in shipments. We\u2019re a run rate business, and we dug through that pretty well, but we definitely have a couple days at this point for this quarter that are impacting us. In our business, when the researchers don\u2019t go into work, they don\u2019t use stuff; and if they\u2019re not using stuff, they don\u2019t need to order more stuff. So it isn\u2019t like instruments where it\u2019s not a big impact, so we\u2019ve got a couple days to worry about but so does everybody else. Matt Tiampo : Thanks guys. Operator : We have a question from Bryan Kipp from Janney Capital. Please go ahead, sir. Bryan Kipp : Hi guys, just a few quick follow-ups. Novus and PrimeGene on a Q-over-Q basis, just looking at it backwards, was 7% contribution in the quarter. Is that just seasonality? I think I had 10% last quarter, so just trying to think of how that\u2019s performing. Is it seasonality, or is there something else going on that we should know about? Charles Kummeth : Yeah, with PrimeGene, there is definitely what I would call more timing, so that\u2019s really an OEM-type business model and we have a lot of timing orders with them right now. It\u2019s not overly material - it\u2019s pretty small, but that would be that. I think in Novus, I think we\u2019re pretty close to being on target. We\u2019re really focused on integrating, so these guys have been great in terms of really getting involved with our team here and they help us on the IT side in getting all this stuff online and the content going and the website re-skin. If you looked at our website and how it\u2019s changed in the last couple of months, that\u2019s all due to Novus people really helping our IT people and getting on this. So it\u2019s moving. Europe, I\u2019d say a little bit--if anything, there might be a little bit of softness in Europe in there. There, we\u2019ve got normal integration issues. We\u2019re harmonizing distributors and things like that, so there is the normal kind of stuff to work through, but nothing material. Bryan Kipp : At some point, are you guys going to break out the contribution that you guys are getting online from the Novus platform? I think you cited 135,000 reagents online now that weren\u2019t in the past. Is that something you can break out in the future, or something you want to shy away from? Charles Kummeth : Probably not, because I really want to fully integrate Novus into R&D Systems, so. Our biotech division will have all this stuff in it, and we\u2019ll report division results for contents sake. Jim Hippel : But at a high level, we do track metrics regarding order taking on the web versus phone and fax, which is kind of the traditional way of doing business. Those metrics continue to dramatically improve, and we\u2019re moving towards electronic-based overtaking them. Charles Kummeth : Yeah, and a lot of cross-selling is happening now, and I will mention since Jim brought it up here too, that a little over less than two years ago when I joined, two-thirds of all orders were phone and fax. You guys have always heard these fun facts, which is still kind of amazing, but we\u2019ve reduced that by a factor of two here, so we\u2019re roughly a third to 40% now. So a lot of that is better ecommerce, better web systems online now. A lot of it is Fisher, more EDI. We\u2019re slowly getting into the 21st century here. Bryan Kipp : Is there any way you can give us high level just of the 7%, the mix on Novus? I\u2019m just thinking, is the bigger step function down q-over-q Novus, or was it PrimeGene? Jim Hippel : On an absolute dollar basis, it was PrimeGene. PrimeGene had some very large orders with a very large customer that tend to be lumpy, and that impacted PrimeGene. Novus was in the mid to high single digit growth rate, so they performed as planned. Bryan Kipp : Okay, and lastly for me, I think you said there\u2019s a CC order that was pushed out. Can you give any color on that - the size of it, when you think it\u2019s going to come through? Charles Kummeth : Well you remember last quarter, I think we were roughly 13% growth in clinical controls, so it\u2019s all timing. We\u2019re 6% year-to-date, and we\u2019re going to end right on schedule there forecast, maybe even a little bit better. It\u2019s all timing. Again, this is very much an OEM-driven business as well, and we have some order timing. Jim Hippel : It\u2019s a combination of stuff that got pulled in last quarter and a couple of orders that pushed out this quarter, so you\u2019ve got to kind of look at it over the year-to-date to get a true sense of the trajectory. Bryan Kipp : Okay, but you think they\u2019ll recognize in 3Q? Charles Kummeth : Say again? Bryan Kipp : You think they\u2019ll recognize in 3Q, the stuff that was pushed out? Charles Kummeth : Yeah, I think we should be fine. Jim Hippel : Our growth rate should be commensurate to what our year-to-date one is. Bryan Kipp : Appreciate it. Charles Kummeth : Bionostics is really working according to plan there. Their funnel, their pipeline is pretty healthy. It\u2019s in line with the core business here that we integrated into, our hematology controls business. They\u2019ve always been kind of steady as she goes between 5 and 7%, and we don\u2019t see any issue with that. Bryan Kipp : All right, thanks again. Operator : The next question comes from Amanda Murphy with William Blair. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am. Amanda Murphy : Hi, good morning guys. Just a few follow-ups, actually, on Paul\u2019s original line of questioning. In terms of the antibodies that you rolled out on the ProteinSimple platform, was there actually any revenue contribution yet? I know it\u2019s early. And then also, are you going to account for that or would that flow through the protein platform line as well, the incremental antibody revenue? Charles Kummeth : No, it will stay on our biotech side. I believe in a matrix model here, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re running. The consumables and the cartridges with CyVek would probably for the short term be with protein platforms, but all reagents, all antibodies, all that will be biotech, and I want these teams working together and they\u2019ve got to work towards the big picture together.  In terms of any contribution, it\u2019s just really launched in the last month or so, so there\u2019s probably some incremental. It\u2019d be hard to measure, but it will grow in time. As you know, Amanda, there are no home run products in this space. It\u2019s a thousand paper cut kind of model, so. Jim Hippel : Yeah. I mean, it definitely is early days for Q2. Literally, this was getting all finalized in the last couple weeks of the quarter, so there\u2019s fairly minimal, if any, impact in Q2. Charles Kummeth : It\u2019s mainly to get the website, get stuff on. They\u2019ve been getting it ready to go all quarter, but getting everything online to be positioned and certified with this new trademark symbol we came up, all that, it takes time to get that even to register in customers\u2019 minds. Amanda Murphy : Got it, and then the Fisher relationship, I appreciate the detail there on the volumes and I know it\u2019s hard to tease it out, but any sense now that you\u2019ve been--you know, have that relationship underway for a few quarters now, as to where that might go ultimately from an additive perspective? Charles Kummeth : Well ultimately, we hope it keeps going up. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see big chunks of going up. I think it\u2019s just going to keep kind of plugging along here and just keep moving in the right direction. I think as you know, we\u2019ve had a lot of change in the guard in that team, and Greg Herrema, who runs all of Fisher now, is a pretty good friend of mine, so we\u2019re doing more and more things, talking together. I\u2019ve been really surprised at just how open the life tech side of that business has been with us, and they were also discussing things, so we\u2019ve got a lot of connections with people. [Indiscernible] who they are at life tech, but we\u2019ve got good relationships, so it\u2019s been very good. Hopefully they\u2019ll keep focusing on us and keep promoting us, and we\u2019ll keep working with them. There\u2019s all these things called punch-outs and there\u2019s all this stuff, software for the ecommerce side, so you have to have a continued strong working relationship on the IT side to make this whole thing work university by university. The numbers they give us are hundreds of thousands out there, so it\u2019s all about getting in front of them and making sure that they are thinking at Fisher. As long as they\u2019re doing that, we\u2019ll play along. Now in parallel, we still have our own direct approach and we have our own kind of home accounts. Fisher doesn\u2019t have an exclusivity issue with us at all, so that hasn\u2019t been an issue either. So working together, we\u2019ll get more, they\u2019ll get more, and with more funding happening hopefully it will help. But I think this gives us the time we need to also talk--we talk a lot about our strategies with KOLs and more prioritization, and creating more important, more difficult, more G&P-related content here, and ultimately innovation wins. So if we keep building the best portfolio for high quality content with the premium R&D Systems brand behind it, we\u2019re going to get more wallet share out there. That\u2019s the ultimate strategy for us. There is innovation and there is channel, and you need them both. Amanda Murphy : Got it. Just last one on the fighter brand side. Are you seeing any--I know obviously you\u2019ve had some good numbers here, but how are you guys thinking about potential cannibalization with the premium brand? Any risks there, anything that you\u2019re seeing thus far? Charles Kummeth : Well, there\u2019s always risk, and I think over time we\u2019re going to have to eat a few of our children. But right now, there really hasn\u2019t been. We\u2019re really focusing our strategies on any accounts that really came on stage last year towards the low end and have walked away from the premium R&D Systems, so we\u2019re attacking there first. It\u2019s been very successful initially with the Novus and PrimeGene brands. I think as you find bigger accounts that are in the middle with multiple cow points and you\u2019ve got both R&D Systems brand, they\u2019re burgeoning, but they\u2019re also buying our competitor, it gets harder, it gets more difficult. But we\u2019re working our way through it. I think ultimately you\u2019ve got to do it over the web with that academia sector, with an optimum web experience, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re focusing on in the long term to try and manage this. Long term, we\u2019ll have an integrated search engine-based web that will have all brands, and you\u2019ll be able to really pick what you want and you\u2019ll be able to even buy from different sites all in the same basket, shopping cart, and move from there. We\u2019re a year or less away from that, so more coming but it\u2019s kind of like that. Amanda Murphy : Okay, thanks very much. Charles Kummeth : It\u2019s hard to measure, but we know we\u2019re getting some impact there. We\u2019ve also brought in a couple more finance people on board as we continue to build out our systems here, and we\u2019re working our way towards having data warehousing and the right data mining, so we\u2019ll have more of this kind of data to work from. Amanda Murphy : Got it, thank you. Operator : The final question in queue comes from Paul Knight with Janney Capital. Please go ahead, sir. Paul Knight : Hey Chuck, I\u2019m back. How was seasonality in the quarter? I know the last two weeks could be good or bad, depending upon how holidays fall and weather goes. Was it as expected on that seasonality issue in the quarter? Charles Kummeth : Yeah, I\u2019d say a pretty insightful question, Paul. I would say we did get hit a little bit in the end, mainly on the OEM side. I don\u2019t know if it was the timing of the holidays or what, but some of the timing we alluded to kind of got us in the last couple weeks. We still pulled out 4% organic growth, so we\u2019re pretty happy, so we\u2019ll see what happens. But there was a little bit of seasonality there, and we\u2019re trying to figure out is it really seasonality or was there something else somewhere. Jim Hippel : It actually impacted the two that have been kind of [indiscernible] this call, which is the PrimeGene and our C2B business, which has the most OEM large account-type business, and those were impacted the most. Paul Knight : And then I don\u2019t know if you care to comment, but I\u2019m sure you follow daily orders. How\u2019s tone of business here in the calendar Q1? Charles Kummeth : Yeah, it\u2019s really hard right now with so early, and we had weather involved already, so even our data this week, it\u2019s the storm that hit the midwest yesterday. So I would say it\u2019s not record breaking yet due to weather mainly, so we\u2019ll see how it shakes out as we go further in. This month generally isn\u2019t--you know, January isn\u2019t a great month for us to begin with, so we\u2019ll how it goes. But we don\u2019t have any early indications of peril or anything yet here, so I think we\u2019re all watching the same things - currency being what it is, and Russia, Japan, et cetera. I think it\u2019s a little bit guarded out there. On a positive sense, I haven\u2019t seen anyone\u2019s numbers that match ours in China, so we seem to be kind of head of the pile there in China, so that\u2019s probably where we\u2019ll keep focusing. Jim Hippel : And that momentum is continuing. Charles Kummeth : Yeah, probably if anything it\u2019s accelerating. It\u2019s a good quarter already, so. Paul Knight : Thank you again. Operator : There are no more questions in queue. Charles Kummeth : All right, well I think this is a record for us for length of time in the call. I appreciate it from all of you. If there\u2019s any more questions, we do have time; otherwise, I\u2019ll make a slow-winded goodbye and thank you for everything. We\u2019ll talk to you next quarter. Operator : There are no further questions. Charles Kummeth : Thank you.",

Baird Dan Leonard - Leerink Drew Jones - Stephens Inc Anthony Faut - William Blair Bryan Kipp - Janney Capital Operator : Good morning and welcome to the Bio-Techne Earnings Conference Call for the Third Quarter of the Fiscal Year 2015. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the call will be open for questions following management\u2019s prepared remarks. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jim Hippel, Chief Financial Officer. Jim Hippel : Good morning and thank you for joining us as we discuss the third quarter results of fiscal year 2015. Also on the call this morning is Chuck Kummeth, Chief Executive Officer of Bio-Techne. Before we begin, let me briefly cover our Safe Harbor statement. Some of the remarks made during this conference call may be considered forward-looking statements. The Company\u2019s 10-K for fiscal year 2014 identify certain factors that could cause the Company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements made during this call. The Company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of any new information or future events or developments. The 10-K as well as the Company\u2019s other SEC filings are available on the Company\u2019s Web site within its Investor Relations section. During the call, non-GAAP financial measures may be used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. Tables reconciling these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available on the Company\u2019s press release issued earlier this morning or on the Bio-Techne Corporation Web site at www.biotechne.com. One other item before we get started, and as I mentioned in previous quarter call, please note that the commentary today regarding the total Company\u2019s Q3 organic growth by end market and geography does not include the performance of our protein platform segment. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Chuck. Chuck Kummeth : Thanks Jim. Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our third quarter earnings call. This morning we reported a 19% increase in revenue for the third quarter driven by our recent deployments of capital in the form of acquisitions. Organic growth was essentially flat compared to same period last year. When we break down our revenue results by business, by platform, by geography, different picture of the business emerges which gives us confidence that the current circumstances are temporary and mask the fundamental solid execution of our continuing strategies to drive long term growth for the Company and create value for our stakeholders. Our strongest product line proteins and what we are most well-known for experienced the best growth in Q3 compared to previous eight quarter. Antibodies on other hand continue to experience the negative effects of extremely competitive landscape. We are working hard in integrated strategies involving Novus Biologicals branded products, improving our customary Web site experience especially to price sensitive customers like academics that drive the largest market demand for antibodies. In North America, we continue to experience stable organic growth. In this region, our bio-pharma end markets were especially strong experiencing double digit growth. Both our U.S. sales team and the Fisher partnership remain focused on engaging customers and understanding their specific needs via our new trade show investments and strategies. In Europe too we experienced solid organic growth in most countries, the one exception being Germany where the pharma market there is still in between major research project cycles for us. You may recall that we experienced 20% growth in Germany last year largely driven by pharma and making for a difficult comp this year. When we look at our results from Asia China continues to perform very well despite the continued apprehension in the overall market brought on by the Chinese government anti-corruption auditing activities. We expect to see continued strength in China as the increase in government\u2019s funded research is approved in our most recent five year plan starts to get released and audit activities wind down. For the full year, we still expect China to perform similar to last year with well over 20% organic growth. This is supported by a strong fourth quarter currently being experienced. Japan on the other hand and to a lesser extent other Pac-Rim markets were negatively impacted by the strength of the U.S. dollar. Here distributors reduced inventories in the wake of volatile exchange rates when currency markets stabilize and inventory frontload we expect the Pac-Rim region to return back to growth. In our clinical control segment, our hematology controls business continued to execute well of growing at 7%. However, our blood glucose and blood gas business experienced delays in several key new projects with large OEM customers. We are very excited about the funnel of projects that we have in this business and have focused on this since the acquisition. Contracts are in place but timing is beyond our control and we expect results in the next couple of quarters. These projects involve the transfer of specific customer, in house controls and packaging operations to our facility in Devens, Massachusetts. As these transfers begin to occur in Q4, we believe we will see growth rates in this part of segment near those of the hematology controls business. Finally, our protein platform segment continued to post strong growth, with organic growth at 23% on a standalone basis. Our teams from both R&D Systems and Protein Simple continue to work very closely together to expand the portfolio of qualified antibodies for the Simple Western platform as well as developing assays for the Simple Plex platform and rationalizing operational strengths and the manufacturer of instruments versus reagents for consumers. Speaking of operational strengths teams across all businesses have done an exceptional job planning savings and achieving productivity in the work flows which have allowed for both gross and operating margins to expand in Q3 versus last year in our organic business despite the heavy negative impact that currency translation has had as a result of the strengthening dollar and especially the weaker euro. I am proud of our teams perseverance to stay focused on our strategies that should enable long term growth and not get distracted not deterred by short-term aberrations. And I am especially pleased with their effort on productivity which has enabled us to continue to make the investments needed to support our strategy while increasing our core margins along the way. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jim for more detail on the financials before we open the lineup for Q&A. Jim? Jim Hippel : Thanks Chuck. As on prior earnings calls, I will provide an overview of our Q3 financial performance for the total company and provide some color on each of our three segments. And as a reminder, at the total company level, we reported organic growth excluded the results of acquired companies up to the one year anniversary date of acquisition. It also excludes the impact of foreign currency translation impact. However for the protein platform segment we\u2019re providing organic growth on a pro forma basis as if we\u2019d owned ProteinSimple and CyVek for all 2014, 2015 to give you more relevant inside into the growth performance of that segment. So starting with the overall financial performance of the third quarter. Adjusted earnings decreased to 8% to $32 million, while adjusted-EPS was $0.86 versus $0.94 in the prior year. The impact of currency translation caused $0.07 of the year-over-year decline. Under GAAP EPS was $0.65 in Q3 compared to $0.85 in the prior year, with the decrease including the amortization of intangibles and other costs related acquisition in addition to the impact of currency translation.  On a top-line Q3 reported sales were $114.2 million an increase of 19% year-over-year and organic growth was essentially flat. Q3 sales included 23% growth from acquisitions and negative 4% impact from foreign exchange. Moving on to the details of the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin came in at 72.5% in Q3, down a 110 basis points from the prior year due to the product mix change associated with the acquisitions occurred since last year. Excluding acquisitions gross margins were up 80 basis points compared to the prior year. Adjusted-SG&A in Q3 was 21.5% of revenue and R&D was 9.5% of revenue. That\u2019s 800 basis points and a 150 basis points higher than last year respectively. The increases in these operating expenses were driven by the acquisitions we made since Q3 of last year. The resulted adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 41.5%. Operating margins excluding the impact of acquisitions increased 60 basis points compared to Q3 of last year. Looking at our numbers below operating income net interest expense in Q3 was $256,000 compared to $529,000 of net interest income last year. As a result of line of credit that was opened in July to partially fund the acquisition of ProteinSimple and the CyVek. Our adjusted effective tax rate in Q3 was 31.4% up 50 basis points from third quarter of last year due to acquisition in geographic mix. The GAAP reported effective tax rate for the quarter was 37.3% as it includes the change in the estimated state taxes for fiscal year 2014 and the first half of fiscal year 2015. This change in tax estimate results final state income proportionate factors being determined following the recent acquisition.  In terms of returning capital we paid out $11.9 million in the form of dividends to our shareholders in the quarter. Average diluted shares were 37,269,000 in Q3 that\u2019s up 216,000 shares or less than 1% from last year as a result of option dilution. Turning to cash flow in the balance sheet $30.8 million of cash was generated from operations in the third quarter and our investment in capital expenditures was $4.9 million. We ended the quarter with $160 million of cash and short-term available for sale investment, up $20 million sequentially from the end of Q2. A long-term debt obligation at the end of Q3 were little changed from the end of Q2 at a $187 million.  That wraps up my comments from a total company performance for the third quarter. Now to discuss performance of our three business segments starting with the biotechnology segment. Q3 net sales were $83.2 million with reported growth of 4% compared to last year and organic growth that was essentially flat. Growth from acquisitions was 7% while the impact from foreign exchange was negative 4%. By geography North America increased in the low single-digits organically. Bio-pharma sales were strong in North America with growth in the teens while academic and government declined by low single-digits during the quarter.  Europe also declined in the low single-digits but with many of countries experiencing high single-digit and even double-digit growth. However, this growth was more than offset by double-digit declines in Germany. As Chuck previously mentioned our business in Germany is being impacted by the timing of research projects in the regional bio-pharma market which was experience a highly active cycle last year making for a difficult year-over-year comp.  China experienced solid organic growth in the mid-teens even with the ongoing Chinese government anti-corruption auditing activities that slowed the release of research funds there. In the Pacific Rim sales declined in the mid single-digits led by Japan which decreased by the low-teen. As sales in this region are handled through distributors and transacted in U.S. dollars, the strengthening U.S. dollar has encouraged our distribution partners to lower stocking level until we believe exchange rates stabilized.  Adjusted operating income for the biotechnology segment was essentially flat in Q3 compared to prior year adjusted operating margin was 55.6%, a decline of 200 basis points from the prior year. The lower adjusted margin percentage is attributable to a change in product mix associated with the acquisition of Novus Biologicals. Turning now to our clinical control segment where Q3 net sales were $15.4 million with both reported inorganic growth essentially flat compared to last year. Revenue growth was strong in the hematology part of the business, however the delay of a few key OEM projects in the blood glucose and blood gas part of the business negated its overall growth.  We expect these projects to begin their transfer to us in Q4 with full ramp up in fiscal year 2016. Adjusted operating margin for the segment decreased 6% in Q3 and adjusted operating margin was 30%, a decrease of 180 basis points from the prior year. Decrease attributable to pricing pressures blood and glucose controlled market. We expect higher margins from new projects beginning Q4 they will help to mitigate the pricing pressure going forward. Moving on to our protein platform segment, where net sales in Q3 were $15.7 million on a pro forma basis assuming ProteinSimple and CyVek were on for the entire quarter in both current and prior years, organic revenues for this segment was 23%. We saw a growth across all product lines with over 200 instruments placed during the quarter. Q3 adjusted operating margin was negative 10.9% as independent companies ProteinSimple and CyVek together reported negative 19.1% adjusted operating margin in the quarter ended March 31, 2014. That concludes my prepared comments and with that I'll turn the call back over to the moderator to open the line for some questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Looks like our first question comes from Paul Knight with Janney Capital, please go ahead. Paul Knight : Hi Chuck, how are the second, excuse me, how is the current quarter resumed in terms of orders etc, is Germany back to what you think is more normal and overall for the quarter? Chuck Kummeth : Overall, we've had a much better start since that quarter, things are looking much better in a lot of areas but not specifically Germany. Germany is a little more of the same, it's going to take another quarter to get it back in the right cycle. These are all real large, large company deals, lot of bulk sales and we reached, we\u2019ve actually been working there, it\u2019s just a cycle thing. But probably not much this quarter yet, but maybe a little better but not like last year. Paul Knight : You had lose additional day's sales to weather this quarter versus last year? Chuck Kummeth : We lost three like everybody else, there was comparable to the same three or four we lost last year so it was really no excuse there, no additional. Paul Knight : Lastly, what are you doing specifically to kind of recover from currency? Are you adjusting pricing and how quickly does that get changed? Chuck Kummeth : I'll let Jim handle that. We're looking at a couple of things. Jim Hippel : Well, first of all on the cost side we're definitely driving productivity for a number of reasons but everyone internal obviously is aware the pressure that FX is putting on the business, and the fact that our core, gross and operating margins actually increased year-over-year with that FX headwind I think goes to the effort that we're doing internally to try to mitigate as much of that pressure as we can. You know with regards to any kind of hedging activity we're not interested in doing that. With regard to pricing the only area where that could come into play potentially would be in Japan, the Pac Rim but the reality is that most of the competition there's in the same boat we are and there's not a lot of internal source to that competition so we're not seeing any price decreases coming competitively yet so we believe that this kind of reduction in inventories will play itself out and we hope the business can come back at our historical pricing levels. Paul Knight : And then lastly, the reagent products I think were introduced for ProteinSimple -- in the March period. Are you seeing traction with that antibody catalogue addition? Chuck Kummeth : Yes, we are actually, we're seeing a lot of good strong traction, we have well over 600 in the catalogue we'll be at double band at this calendar year and traction's beginning. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Elliott with Robert W. Baird, please go ahead. Katherine Lee : Hi guys, this is Katherine filling in for Jeff. We were wondering if you could give us any color on the protein platforms margins, any reasons they've gone negative? Chuck Kummeth : Well I think year-on-year we've actually made a big improvement, over 10 points, it\u2019s probably, it\u2019s more aligned with CyVek being part of it. Jim Hippel : And I'd also suggest that the revenue profile of the business as well, so the instrument business has a cycle that's a little bit different than our consumer business than that. The calendar, the December calendar year-end, given that the year-end for many customers' CapEx budgets as well as our own fiscal year-end tend to be the stronger quarters for the instrument and so with a lower revenue dip in that naturally occurs in Q1, you know it's not so much the cost structure increase it was more of a cycle in a lower revenue dip. Chuck Kummeth : Got to remember this is an instrument, it's very different than our normal consumer business that we are much more run ready. So end of calendar year and end of our fiscal year will be the better quarters so you'll see better results this quarter just because of the cycle time. This last quarter is at natural levers, they were you know -- they were really great in line actually where they need to be. We've had the normal things to work with products coming up to speed and stuff, we had -- we actually had a couple of weeks, we had a slow down due to some issues which was published. We had the same kind of thing last quarter which wasn't published, it's all normal service stuff we've had -- our backlog's been totally done with and taken care of the end of the quarter so this is actually it's a normal kind of cycle quarter for that business, 23% organic growth is above our model for this acquisition so, we\u2019re hoping for 25 or better this quarter, we'll see. Katherine Lee : So going forward I guess how should we think about those margins, just think about them on the instrument cycle? Chuck Kummeth : Well, you know it was all put out in the S1 and kind of [commented] -- we talked about it that they were in the high 60s overall. I think that will come down as we meld in the CyVek numbers, but ProteinSimple on its own will be, we always think hopefully north of 55% gross margins. With a little extra volume and another strong IP holding out and 70 is still a goal for us but we haven\u2019t achieved that yet. Operator : The next question comes from Dan Leonard with Leerink. Please go ahead. Dan Leonard : A couple on the protein platform\u2019s business, first off could you put the 200 instrument placements in the quarter in context. How does that compare year-over-year and is that mix mostly West and any other color you could offer? Chuck Kummeth : Well, I don\u2019t have the numbers, maybe Jim does, I\u2019ll let him comment in a second. From a high level, we are actually right on target on forecast the imaging section of the business and the other two the Simple Western is roughly comparable to the Biologicals site. And both are kind of where they need to be. I\u2019d say Biologicals we\u2019re little here above where we expected and Simple Western maybe just a hair below, but nothing out of the ordinary for that kind of -- it\u2019s hard to divide up and get too much in the 200 instruments total across the board just not granular enough. Jim Hippel : I guess I would add to that is that it give some color to the number we\u2019ve had some questions in the past about instruments so I thought I\u2019d put it out there, but I think the number of instruments year-over-year is comparable to the revenue growth that you see. With regards to what the breakdown that looks like as a reminder we had three product lines imagers, Biologics as well as Simple Western and the price points to those instruments vary quite a bit. So, for example we have the Biologics instruments or over 100,000. We have large Simple Western instruments that could be as much as 300,000 and then we have the desktop Simple Western which could be 50 to 60 and then the imagers they are much lower. So the number of instruments can mix can vary quite a bit on the profile. Chuck Kummeth : Just timing on one or two what we call the big [indiscernible] 300,000 instruments can dramatically change the outlook of a quarter for us. Dan Leonard : And then secondly my follow up, I was curious if you can quantify the various timing issues you spiked out in the press releases impacting the quarter. And regarding Germany did you just have more customer concentration in Germany than you do elsewhere and that\u2019s why that\u2019s worth calling out? Thank you. Chuck Kummeth : We do. We have strong relations of largest bio-parma in Germany and you know the characterizes, I don\u2019t like to comment on their businesses. But they are all strong with us and last year was an exceptionally good year. we sell a lot of what we call bulk to them. So these are large orders. Jim Hippel : And I\u2019d say in Germany roughly 20% of our revenue in Europe is concentrated in Germany. Chuck Kummeth : Actually it\u2019s 23. Jim Hippel : It\u2019s over 20. Dan Leonard : And just in terms of the variance versus plan if you think about the issues divided between Germany, the OEM in clinical controls and the third, is there relative contribution you could offer? Chuck Kummeth : Could you repeat that question one more time, it didn\u2019t come across clear. Dan Leonard : So the three issues you spiked out in the press releases is timely related, one with Germany, the other was Japan currency and then the final was clinical controls. Is there like a contribution you could offer in terms of how much each of those issues contributed to variance versus your plan, was it a third, a third, a third? Or was one of them more impactful than another? Chuck Kummeth : Honestly I\u2019d say they were all fairly comparable than impact which is why we call them mild. Dan Leonard : Got it. Chuck Kummeth : They\u2019re all are off, none of them are hugely materially large, but all together -- just a couple of points. Dan Leonard : Okay, thank you. Chuck Kummeth : I would like to point out we had pretty good U.S. business in Academia, we\u2019re really in this call in the past and talked about our negative double digit contraction and we were only -- we were in low single digits. So that the Fisher relationship is still working our U.S. business is doing pretty well. It was a lot of timing issues than I think when you consider the impact of the Japan -- impact of the controls from the Devens unit as well as Germany it does fill in that gap. The U.S. wasn\u2019t a problem at all if we would have been at where we\u2019re at usually with these other areas that have been normal kind of quarter for us really. So we feel pretty confident, these are all pretty explainable and we can deal -- the FX is going to cause the issues, cause it [indiscernible] it\u2019s caused stocking issues for us but as Jim said in areas like Japan we don\u2019t have any Japanese competitor that has one up and so we don\u2019t use inventories for the same issues as everybody else, things are going to run low and they\u2019re going to be buying again. And we\u2019re actually already seeing a little of that. Operator : Our next question comes from Drew Jones with Stephens Inc. Please go ahead. Drew Jones : Looking at operating margin improvements over the past couple of quarters and the drivers there, the gross margin improvements and improvements with SG&A spending are those sustainable? Chuck Kummeth : I think they are. We\u2019ve had as you know we\u2019ve talked about our productivity projects we\u2019re not trying to place into a Six Sigma unit or anything but there has been a lot of good work here on the operations side, starting with year and half ago when we created the operations unit we separated the business since the -- in actual factory versus what\u2019s development here and that\u2019s actually paid off quite well. I could get in specifics but there is -- we're known for our quality, we\u2019re known for having lot of quality data and these testing work flows are all being addressed, we\u2019re doing much more statistical process control, we\u2019re improving our quality with also with respect to reducing and taking out cost for the way of testing advantages is one example. The Fisher work has created great savings for us in terms of how we buy a supply here. We've hired in house legal counsel which have paid us a ton of money compared to last year farming it all out going five acquisitions, I mean I can go on and on. But I think they are all very sustainable where we\u2019re just getting started. Jim and I and other come from larger companies, we\u2019re used to driving productivity targets and lean ideas as well as Six Sigma and those are all taking root here I'm actually quite excited about continuing. It's not going to dramatic but I think these kinds of numbers are -- probably should be sustainable for your question. Drew Jones : Perfect. You guys have talked a lot about the antibody certification program and just you touched on it a little bit earlier; can you give us any color about that group of -- I think you said 800 that you certified so far. How they are doing compared to the rest of the portfolio? Chuck Kummeth : Well I said 600 or so, we've have about 1,200 - 1,250 at the end of the year. These things take a little while to catch speed because you know we lot has done over the Web and anything else. So there is traction. We have a hundreds of orders already on these and it's starting to pick up. I guess way to look at it from our point of view, we look at it compared to how other new reagents that we offer start out and how they\u2019re doing and these are fitting the model. For us it's all -- we see it all as all incremental upside, so it's all good. So we hope that it continues to track us on. We think this is the way to go, this is why we bought ProteinSimple to have this value add solutions based focus into our customers, so they don't have to fuss with the antibodies themselves, they can get these and they right away have the recipe on how these things work. So we want to keep driving this. Is 600 enough? It's really not. I mean we\u2019re getting some traction but we need probably a couple of thousand here, it will take a couple of years to get this and one of our operational strategy is to figure out how to get more of these certified -- how to grind through it, it\u2019s a lot of work. And you need to get that data and you need to verify and got to get the marketing promotional, everything all round it, behind it and get all in line. It's a lot of work but the team is been really good at this and we\u2019re actually great on schedule maybe in a little ahead of schedule on our account. Drew Jones : And then last one from me but just to clarify as far as impact from the strong dollar is only place where you are seeing a transactional impact is Japan? Chuck Kummeth : No, let me clarify that. So in terms of the impact that\u2019s fitting our translational adjustment to the P&L, it's more entirely out of Europe. With regards to Japan the Pac Rim we actually sell the distributor there in U.S. dollars. So there is no currency translation impact there for us. It does make the products more expensive in local currency; i.e. yen, but gain we\u2019re not seeing any -- there is not much in the way of local competition there and we\u2019re not seeing price reductions from competition there yet that requires us to react at this point. Operator : The next question comes from Amanda Murphy with William Blair. Please go ahead. Anthony Faut : This is actually Anthony in for Amanda how you are guys doing? Chuck Kummeth : Doing good. Anthony Faut : Real quickly even as a follow-up regarding this year distribution, in regard to that I guess could you provide a little bit more maybe inside or regarding the potential upside overtime? Chuck Kummeth : I have been very clear about this we started the arrangement and we\u2019re looking at negative in the tens double-digit declines in our academia markets and how to catch up and so the one key thing that is starting out to coming in here with the from our [relationship] being I understand the Fisher model pretty well coming from Fisher. And then Jim as well coming in later. I\u2019ve always said getting back with our strategies getting this back to even, even would be great. We've bounced around between this negative 2 to positive 3 in the last couple of quarters and I expect we will be there. I think it will drift into lower single-digits and be steady there, I don't ever see Fisher getting us into double-digit gains or anything like that. It will take other strategies, I think the strategies that we just talked about with certified antibodies there is a better strategy for incremental growth. But how to take on competition, how to get more of that wall share of academia, it's all about coverage we have five reps in the key regions that help work with the bigger accounts and work with the inside sales team locally but how do you get actually hundreds or thousands of academic research, we largely buy online and through citations and references, et cetera. So the combination of Fisher with [indiscernible] Street and the better web experience strategy for that.  We\u2019re well on our way to Fisher, I am very happy about the result is working -- it\u2019s working really well on their favor because there is a lot of swap right now but their numbers look [indiscernible] but the net of it all is positive, which we were after and that\u2019s how we pay them as we\u2019ve talked about in the past. And into the coming year we\u2019re adding features and improving our website all the time. It's our single biggest adventure here in IT and we have folks from Novus really working on this, and taking new ship rolls this being their website and their model is very good in this we think and more to come. So combination should get us to, low to back to low mid single digit, I think we're on track with Fisher and it is what it is. I also know CyVek but I don't, they're also working hard as a company to really get their Life Tech portfolio online. You got to remember these guys are good at dealing with millions of skews and we don't see any distraction right now with Life Tech at all, we've very little overlap with them, as you know we talked in the last quarter, somebody had a question so no issue there either and the teams get along very well. It's the best non-conflict I've ever seen, so I'm very happy. Anthony Faut : And I appreciate the insight, we know it's a huge undertaking and as another question, in regard to the recent acquisitions I guess would you also be able to provide a little bit more of a color regarding the actual revenue contributions or even the potential timing of synergies related from those recent acquisitions? Chuck Kummeth : Well, I think you're seeing some of it here, I guess in our margins, there are synergies coming, again the antibodies certifications are all sale synergies. In terms of cost synergies, not a whole lot, everybody knows how lean we are as a company so we never did any of the deals for real cost synergy opportunities, it's more about sale synergies. There will be some synergies between the CyVek unit as we integrate that into ProteinSimple and we've seen some of that, certainly in the channel and the commercial activities. That said, it's also got to be carefully worked because we don't want to distract or have any dilution of the activity on the ProteinSimple channel organization so we've been very careful there, but there are some synergies there. And they're kind of you know -- the sales side these things are showing up a little bit along with the productivity numbers. Anthony Faut : Perfect, thank you, then lastly, would you be able to provide just a little bit more insight as to while regarding this is M&A going forward? Chuck Kummeth : Well as you know, things aren't real cheap out there right now, we've actually been hunting as much as we've ever been hunting and we've been fairly quiet for nine months here still, but we've been very active, you just don't see it or hear about it and as I repeatedly said and Jim's here to make sure I'm always honest on it, that we aren't going to do a bad deal. So we\u2019ve been engaged and we've walked away from some, we're looking at some. We're still interested in our primary strategies, we're interested in doing more to create more critical mass in our clinical and control segment, especially as it relates to more on the regulated side or more towards diagnostics or point of care type of direction which that industry is going, we're interested in diagnostics, we're interested in diagnostics in China, we're interested in other solutions like ProteinSimple that can give us platforms that can leverage our content here. So those are still in strategies and we're engaged in some and I can't comment further, that they get done when they get done and then we'll do a deal when it makes sense. Other than that there's been no change in our philosophy or intent or our hunger, okay. We have a strong balance sheet, we\u2019ve got lots of debt capacity to take on yet, even to stay well [phase] beyond covenants we're roughly flat here and when you look at our cash we have, what we have for debt and so you know. We just need some better deals. Operator : The next question comes from Thomas DeBourcy with Alger, please go ahead. Operator : Thomas, your line is open, did you have a question? Operator : Okay, the next question in queue comes from Bryan Kipp with Janney Capital, please go ahead. Bryan Kipp : Hi guys, quick follow up here. I know PrimeGene you had a deferred lumpy order in 2Q, did that come through in 3Q? I know you continue to cite 20 plus percent organic growth in China, so just trying to think in context. Chuck Kummeth : Our PrimeGene unit is roughly half on we'll call it OEM lumpy order side and half on a branded commercial retail kind of a business model. We're more focused on trying to expand that side of it if we can, for China for China, and leverage them as a factory for China, etc. We want to drive this OEM business as best we can even globally but that's hard which is one reason you know they're coming to health. So there's some lumpiness. This quarter is starting out better, some are coming through and you know it's not a large business so it's not that material but we're very happy so far we've not lost a single employee there, pretty must to say about in China. They're working on a new factory, so we bought them when they were kind of just getting started. They're well connected to the Fudan University and we have a brand facility [indiscernible] mid-summer for an expansion of their business and give us a lot more G&P capability, so lot of good stuff to come, hopefully more China to China, but the OEM segment is still important, we're trying to drive that but obviously it's more competitive and trying to get that to work in orders that may over an year is difficult as well right now. So. It's a little better. Jim Hippel : As a reminder I'll add that we just we just passed our one year anniversary of acquiring PrimeGene here in April, so in Q4 those results will be included in our organic growth through the years for China. Bryan Kipp : Helpful and then any utilization color you can guys can give around ProteinSimple? I know the 600 proteins that you guys are augmenting to the platform, et cetera. Are you seeing utilizations rate increase amongst the already placed instruments -- on consumables? Jim Hippel : Consumables? Well certainly on these yes, I mean it's all brand incremental -- in terms of what else is being bought for those machines is probably hard to get that actual data. In general our biggest area has been competition with antibodies, so I think we\u2019re still quarter or couple away in these strategies that have traction. I can tell you that we have quite a few machines ourselves here in Minneapolis and being used in development and we\u2019re using a lot of content on them. So hopefully everybody else as well as -- if more install happened there will be more purchases. They do even on their websites, they do support other company's products as well, it's just not a close business and open system which we\u2019re very okay with. We will try to drive for more wells here by earning it and are still partial good. Bryan Kipp : And then the last one from me, is I know you guys have tried to right size of portfolio for the most part, focused on core verticals and products et cetera. What kind of runoff are you seeing from legacy products where maybe you are not investing in or maybe you are just letting fall the way side, are you seeing 1% to 2% pressure there or is it more now? Jim Hippel : Very little, as we've all seen the chart where we have this reserve waterfall, it's kind of build the life cycle for ever here. We have not end of life a whole lot of anything here in the content side now we've done some good work on our inventory in our stock and cost reductions there, we've quite literally have things in our warehouse that have been here for like 20 years and are still good and still salable. And I'm not sure we need all of it, so things like that have been dealt with. But in terms of taking out SKUs or fee reduction, as you and I've also commented in the past that the curing cost of these products is almost nothing. So there just isn\u2019t a kind of complexity around having these product as other business models. I think the complexity comes on the website and supporting everything online and as you will also know we don't have a single product over in the reagent side over $2 million. So it's very well -- even we dispersed and our bigger seller is almost our oldest product. So it doesn't really mean much about the age of -- who it'll be, where it's going to be. And things can be rejuvenated, I mean we can add something kind of go softer couple of years and thinking that maybe that one is done and then somebody writes a right paper and guess what -- activity increases and fold again. So it's kind of a strange model that way. Operator : [Operator Instructions] There are no other questions in queue. Chuck Kummeth : All right. Again we took more time than usual, that\u2019s good, good questions. We\u2019re very happy with a lot of results, we\u2019re disappointed of course with some. It'd be nice if it had been at 2% or 3% growth but timing issues is really everything on this stuff. But I would like to thank all of you. I now our team is working hard here and even harder. And we'll be back to talk to you again next quarter. Thank you.",

Thanks for joining us today for our fourth quarter call. This morning, we reported a 27% increase in revenue for the fourth quarter, with strength organically in most of our end markets and with sales contribution from the acquisitions we made over the past year. Organic growth was solid for the quarter, at 7%, with nice contribution from both our Biotechnology and Clinical Control segments. The strong finish for the year allowed us to end fiscal year 2015 with full-year revenues that grew 26% overall and 4% organically. Protein, the Biotech product that we are most well known for, experienced mid-single digit growth in Q4, just as it has for the last several quarters. We feel Proteins are positioned well to continue this growth trajectory going forward. Antibodies, another significant Biotech product category, also had a solid quarter with mid-single digit organic growth. This marks the first quarter in over eight quarters where we have had positive growth in antibodies. Biotech's Assays product category also performed similarly, and together this is the reasons that the Biotech division had the best quarter in years. We are delighted to see this and it gives us confidence that we are doing the right things to rejuvenate the core of the company. We are very excited about the progress with integrating our Reagents-based acquisitions, PrimeGene and Novus. PrimeGene has experienced near 100% growth in our China for China brand strategy. They've just moved to a new factory, where we will focus on G&P level products as well as boosting the product portfolio. Novus is completely integrated now and the internal system infrastructure that managed over 200,000 antibody products is now a central system in our overall antibody commercial operations. We have now crossed the 800 mark for certified antibodies to run on our Simple Wes platform within our ProteinSimple business. This will allow researchers to purchase our antibodies with confidence that they'll perform as advertised. In Q4, North America continued to experience stable organic growth for the Biotech division. In this region, our biopharma end markets experienced approximately 10% growth, as they've done for all of fiscal year 2015. And our academia end market continued with its streak of sequential improvements since the Fisher channel partnership was put in place over a year ago, with growth this quarter in the mid-single digits. Both our U.S. sales team and the Fisher channel remain focused on engaging customers and understand their specific needs in combination with our new trade show investment and strategies. Europe rebounded in Q4, with most countries continuing to perform nicely. Germany was less the drag on organic growth during the quarter, with low-single digit declines year-over-year compared to the double-digit declines throughout the rest of fiscal year 2015. There are signs now that the pharma research cycle in Germany may have bottomed and we could see an uptick in growth here later in fiscal year 2016. Currency translation in Europe continued to be a significant headwind in Q4 and this is headwind will stay with us throughout the first half of fiscal year 2016, assuming they stay where they are today. When we look at our results in Asia, China really knocked it out of the park in Q4, with 35% organic growth, finishing the year with organic growth in the mid-20%s, just as we expected at the beginning of the fiscal year. What we didn't foresee a year ago was the disruption caused by the Chinese government's anti-corruption auditing activities. But our team in China persevered despite the distractions and I'm very proud of what they achieved this year. We've now grown the Bio-Techne organization in China from just 12 people two years ago to now near 100. We expect exciting times in China to continue. In the Pacific Rim, we reported last quarter this region was impacted negatively by distributors reducing inventories due to the sudden strengthening of the U.S. dollar. In Q4 Japan was still soft, showing signs of stabilizing, while the rest of the Pacific Rim markets returned to double-digit growth. Assuming no further change in exchange rates, we believe the worst is behind us and Japan too will return to growth in fiscal year 2016. In our Clinical Controls division, some new projects from OEM customers that were delayed last quarter began to transfer in Q4, resulting in revenue growth in the high-single digits for the quarter. For the year, Clinical Controls grew mid-single digits. We remain excited about some of the projects that we have for the business and we expect this kind of annual growth rate to continue. Lastly, our Protein Platforms segment finished the year with 22% organic growth on a standalone basis but suffered in Q4 of roughly flat year-over-year revenue and breakeven operating profit. The year-over-year comparable was especially difficult in Q4, given it was the last full quarter under prior ownership. However, the Q4 performance of this division was still below our expectations. There were several setbacks in the quarter, mostly related to the integration of CyVek and commercial team attrition. We have done a lot of reviewing of the situation, the operations, the team and the commercial processes and feel we have corrected the primary issues causing the bump in the road. We also recognize that it's an instruments business that will be more lumpy quarter-to-quarter than our core run rate reagents business model. Nothing has changed in our view of the market potential of the game-changing platform solutions and continue to expect the business to operate at 20% organic growth annually for the foreseeable future. We must also remember that CyVek is a pure start-up. And while we are now selling instruments, the product line should be viewed as a few years behind ProteinSimple. Thus, this product line will be dilutive to adjusted earnings until revenues start to scale, with profitability not expected until fiscal year 2017. But the future is very bright here, it's just not here yet. To help guide us towards this bright future, we have hired a new Head of Human Resources who is experienced in change management. We are very excited about this new addition to our executive team. The company has grown in the past two years from 750 people to nearly 1,500 and from six sites to 21. The promise of success for Bio-Techne will be directly related to how fast we can get businesses and teams working together, collaborating on complete solutions that are comprised of both reagents and instruments in our strategic markets. Focusing on managing change, culture and collaboration will accelerate our time to success. I am proud of our team's record performance this quarter and the increasing amount of dedication to our business. There is true excitement and energy coming not only from our headquarters in Minneapolis, but all our new sites and regions. It shows our recently conducted commercial reviews and in the faces of all those involved. We look forward to another strong year ahead with ever-increasing growth levels of the company, given new many platforms that we now have in our portfolio. With that, I will turn the call over to Jim for more detail on the financials before we open the line up for Q&A. Jim? James T. Hippel - CFO, VP-Finance & Principal Accounting Officer : Thanks, Chuck. As on prior earnings calls, I will provide an overview of our Q4 financial performance for the total company and then provide some color on each of our three segments. As a reminder, at the total company level, reported organic growth excludes the results of acquired companies up to the one-year anniversary date of acquisition and it also excludes the impact of foreign currency translation. However, for the Protein Platforms segment, we are providing organic revenue growth on a pro forma basis as if we owned ProteinSimple and CyVek for all 2014 and 2015. So starting with the overall financial performance for the fourth quarter. Adjusted earnings was approximately flat to the prior year at $32.6 million, while adjusted EPS was $0.87 versus $0.88 in the prior year. The impact of currency translation was a $0.05 year-over-year headwind. For the full year 2015 adjusted earnings were $126.8 million, a 1% increase versus prior year. Adjusted EPS was $3.40 versus $3.39, with a foreign currency translation headwind of $0.18. Under GAAP, EPS recorded was $0.71 compared to $0.72 in the prior year. And for the full year GAAP EPS was $2.89 versus $3 last year. The decrease from last year for both the quarter and the year was driven by the amortization of intangibles and other costs related to acquisitions, in addition to the impact of currency translation. On the top line, Q4 reported sales were $117.7 million, an increase of 27% year-over-year, with organic growth of 7%. Q4 sales included approximately 25% growth from acquisitions and a negative 4% impact from foreign exchange. Full-year reported revenue was $452.2 million, an increase of 26%, with organic growth at 4%. Revenue for the full year included approximately 25% growth from acquisitions and a 2% headwind from currency translation. Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin came in at 70.8% in Q4, down 250 basis points from the prior year. The decrease is due to product mix change associated with the acquisitions that have occurred since last year as well as the impact of currency translation. For the full year, adjusted gross margin was 71.6%, down 190 basis points from last year. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and FX, core gross margins marginally improved year-over-year for both the quarter and the full year due to the business productivity initiatives. Adjusted SG&A in Q4 was 21.7% of revenue and R&D was 9.2% of revenue, 650 basis points and 100 basis points higher than last year, respectively. The increases in these operating expenses were driven by the acquisitions made since Q4 of last year. The resulting adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 39.9%. Operating margins excluding the impact of acquisitions and FX were flat compared to Q4 of last year. For the full year, adjusted SG&A was 21.7% of revenue and R&D expense was 9% of revenue, a 700 basis point and 30 basis point increase, respectively, from the prior year. The resulted adjusted operating margins for the full year were 40.8%. Again, excluding the impact of acquisitions, FX and higher non-cash stock-based compensation, operating margins were essentially flat to the prior year. Looking at our numbers below operating income, net interest expense in Q4 was $260,000 compared to $1 million of net interest income last year. This is as a result of a line of credit that was opened in July of 2014 to partially fund the acquisitions of ProteinSimple and CyVek. Net interest expense for the full year was $0.9 million versus interest income of $2.7 million in the prior year. Adjusted other non-operating income for Q4 was $0.7 million compared to $0.4 million of non-operating expense in the prior year quarter. And for the full year, adjusted non-operating expense was $0.3 million versus $1.1 million in the prior year. Adjusted non-operating year-over-year improvements for both the quarter and the full year were driven by favorable transactional currency exchange fluctuation. Our adjusted effective tax rate in Q4 was 31.2%, up 50 basis points from the fourth quarter of last year due to acquisition and geographic mix. And for the full year, the adjusted effective tax rate was 31% EBIT, up 10 basis points from the prior year. In terms of returning capital, we continue to pay our dividend and paid out $11.9 million in the quarter and $47.1 million for the year. Average diluted shares were up 0.2 million shares for both the fourth quarter and the full year at 37.3 million shares and 37.2 million shares, respectively. Both time periods represent less than 1% dilution from last year as a result of stock option grants. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. $37.1 million of cash was generated from operations in the fourth quarter and $139.4 million was generated during the full year. Our investment in capital expenditures was $6.9 million for the quarter and $19.9 million for the year. We ended the year with $110 million of cash and short-term available-for-sale investments, down $50 million sequentially from the end of Q3. The decrease was driven by incremental pay-down of our line of credit. As a result, our long-term debt obligations at the end of Q4 stood at $112 million, a decrease of $75 million from the end of Q3. That wraps up my comments on the total company performance for the fourth quarter and full year. And now I'll discuss the performance of our three business segments, starting with the Biotechnology segment. Q4 net sales for the segment were $83.83 million, with reported growth of 9% compared to last year and organic growth of 7%. Growth from acquisitions was 7%, while the impact from foreign exchange was negative 5%. By geography, North America increased in the high-single digits organically. Biopharma sales continued to be strong in the region, with growth nearing 10%, while academic and government experienced its best quarter in many years, with growth in the mid-single digits. Europe rebounded from Q3 and experienced organic growth in the mid-single digits, with most countries performing well and Germany less of a drag on the growth for the region. China experienced fantastic organic growth in the mid-30%s while Pacific Rim was flat year-over-year. As Chuck noted earlier, excluding Japan, the Pacific Rim grew approximately 10%. And for the full year, Biotechnology segment revenue was $325.9 million with organic growth at 3%. Adjusted operating income for the Biotechnology segment increased 2% in Q4 compared to the prior year and adjusted operating margin was 52.4%, a decline of 340 basis points year-over-year. Foreign exchange currency translation impacted adjusted operating income negatively by 7% and operating margin by 120 basis points. The remaining decline in adjusted margin percentage is attributable to a change in product mix associated with the acquisition of Novus Biologicals. For all of fiscal year 2015, adjusted operating margin was 52.5%, also a decline of 340 basis point year-over-year, driven by the negative impact of FX and mix from acquisitions. Turning now to our Clinical Controls segment, where Q4 sales were $17.2 million. Both reported and organic growth was 9% compared to last year. For all of fiscal year 2015, sales were $60.4 million and organic growth was 5%. Adjusted operating income for the segment increased 5% in Q4 and adjusted operating margin was 30.1%, a decrease of 120 basis points from the prior year. The decrease was attributable to pricing pressure in the blood glucose controls market. However, margins have since stabilized and were flat to Q3. For the full fiscal year 2015, adjusted operating margin was also 30.1%, a decrease of 60 basis points year-over-year. Moving on to our Protein Platforms segment, where net sales in Q4 were $17.2 million. On a pro forma basis, assuming ProteinSimple and CyVek were owned for the entire quarter in both current and prior years, organic revenue for the segment decreased 2%. As Chuck mentioned earlier, the ProteinSimple business experienced a very tough comparable where they grew 48% last year in what was their final quarter of prior ownership. This tough comparable together with the integration of CyVek and commercial transition activities in Q4 contributed to a lack of growth. For the full year, on a pro forma basis, Protein Platforms grew 22% organically and we expect to see this kind of growth in fiscal year 2016 and beyond. Adjusted operating margin in Q4 was essentially breakeven. As independent companies, ProteinSimple and CyVek together reported negative 6.2% adjusted operating margin in the quarter ended June 30, 2014. In all of fiscal year 2015 for the period of time since the acquisitions that formed this new segment, adjusted operating margin was 6.7%. That concludes my prepared comments. And with that, I will turn the call back to the moderator to open the line up for some questions. Operator : Our first question is going to come from Dan Leonard from Leerink. Please go ahead. Dan? Dan L. Leonard - Leerink Partners LLC : Apologies. I had you on mute. Can you hear me now? Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, we can year you, Dan. James T. Hippel - CFO, VP-Finance & Principal Accounting Officer : Yeah. Dan L. Leonard - Leerink Partners LLC : Great. So my first question is on the Platforms business. Can you speak to the visibility you have on the 20% organic growth view and whether there's any sort of backlog to support that or new product funnel? Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: There's a strong new product funnel. In fact ProteinSimple's organization has three different product lines, Simple Western, Biologics and some other analytics that go along with the imaging stuff. Biologics was the biggest issue for this bump in the road this quarter. Actually on a Simple Wes platform, we had a record quarter for installations, it was a record number. So the pipeline is strong. They've got deep programs in all the areas, including Biologics. So more products coming and announcements soon to be had. Dan L. Leonard - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. And then my follow up. Is there anything we should be aware of as it relates to pacing throughout fiscal 2016, any days issues in any given quarter or anything you'd call out? James T. Hippel - CFO, VP-Finance & Principal Accounting Officer : Yeah, Dan, nothing I'd call out specifically. There may be a day here or there quarter-to-quarter, but nothing that we haven't seen in our pacing from last year. Dan L. Leonard - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And our next question is going to come from Matt Hewitt from Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead. Dillon K. Hoover - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC : Hey. Good morning, guys. This is actually Dillon on for Matt. Digging into the Biotech segment growth, just wondering or trying to get a better sense of the customer mix that's driving that growth. Is that just new product growth, getting deeper with existing customers, or are you guys taking business from peers? Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, it's a combination of things. I mean, one is we've talked about announcing a new website. We've had strong traction with that. We've had a pretty good lift with our academia by the market this quarter. And the Fisher numbers were the strongest we've ever had as well. Biotech pharma was also kind of on par where it's been, right at around 10%, around there, which is also very good. All things considered, that's what's been adding up to the (19:39) growth in the Biotech side, a record for us while I've been here anyway, probably been many years. James T. Hippel - CFO, VP-Finance & Principal Accounting Officer : Yeah, I would just add it's too early to claim victory in terms of taking share from anywhere. What we've seen from reported results from other companies in our space, biopharma and academic has performed fairly well this quarter as well. So I think we're definitely keeping up with the market, but I think it's too early to say we're at the point of taking share. Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think the thing to point out is we were much stronger than we have been in the past in antibodies. So that's our biggest, deepest, our broader investment area for the company. I mean, we're on the fence with Proteins, and that's going fine. It's about antibodies and we've make some pretty good strides there. Dillon K. Hoover - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC : Okay. And then a quick follow up. Just in terms of the capital deployment strategy in 2016 in the form M&A, are we going to expect any changes in the form of pace or size of deals? Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, in terms of capital, we were kind of consistent with the capital the way we've been in the past and for operations. On the M&A side, we did officially one deal we bought in last, (20:42) most of these we did the first month into the fiscal year this last year. And we're on the way to integrating most of them. Novus is completely integrated at this plant. Looking forward, we've never worked any less hard than we are now. We're trying, like everyone does. We've got a strong funnel 60-some-plus targets that we've had. (20:58) They range in size from start-up to large transformational deals. We're on the hunt all the time for things that hit our strategy, but we think strategically first. That said, especially on the front where there's auctions, it's not a great for finding great deals. It's a good time for owners thinking that they should think about selling because everybody knows the market is pretty hot. So that's helpful, but you've still got to get a good price and it's hard on both the private and public side, so we're diligent. We're working the process. We have a deep and very rigorous process, but we won't do a dumb deal, we walked away from lot in this last year because the numbers weren't good enough for us. But strategy first, numbers second. And we'll keep hunting. Dillon K. Hoover - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC : Great. Thanks. And congrats on good quarter. Operator : And our next question is going to come from Jeff Elliott from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. Jeff T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah, good morning. Nice quarter, guys. Chuck, can you provide any other color on the issues you had in the Protein Platforms division? Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, we've been digging into it pretty hard, as you might imagine. We had a lot of integration typical type concerns. We had some market conditions as well. We had, as you already know and others know, we had some bumps in some running buffers from some ancillary products that go with instruments. We have those corrected this last quarter, but that probably flowed through a little bit. Everything is caught up there, the backlog is caught up As I mentioned, it was a record quarter for shipping Wes systems (22:32). Biologics is little bit lumpy. And on the Biologics side, we have some larger platforms there, hundreds of thousands of dollars. And that's where we've had some issues. I mean, you miss a couple of those and you're off a quite a bit. So could be timing in some of those orders, but they didn't hit. I think also I've got to point out the FX in Europe. This has affected us in demand and our numbers in Europe quite a bit. And we see all that returning. Things are looking much better. We did have some commercial team attrition, fully expected. We knew that a lot of that team would move on with Tim and Terry when they transitioned out of the business, and they did. I will mention we brought in an individual from my past at Thermo Fisher that ran the entire mass spec business for us, (23:21) very strong person. He's on board and like a kid in a candy shop putting in processes for the saves (23:32) this company is in right now in a growth level. It's coming together. I'm very confident that we've got things under control here. It's lumpy. And it is an instrument business, it's going to be lumpier. I think our full plan was low-double digits, because coming off the record fourth quarter last year and they sold everything they could before they sold to us, and that's natural. And so we'll see. Now, if we have another quarter or two of flat going forward, then things are going to change. But we don't have any hair on fire alarms here yet. So it's kind of I think just the usual. And things are looking pretty good there this quarter and I think it's just a natural transition with this type of business model we think. Jeff T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Got it. And it sounds like you don't want to give fiscal 2016 guidance, but would you be able to comment on the estimates that you see out there, the stuff in consensus? Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, we think you guys are closer on the revenue side and still some work to do I think on the bottom line with our investments in SG&A. So I think you're close or catching up. It looks good, we'll give the feedback we can. We still are not giving guidance. We put out our notes for the future and our goals. I will say that we've been very public with everybody about, as we annualize these deals and looking forward, we should be in 8% to 12% kind of growth range going forward. And it could vary a lot depending on the lumpiness of our instrument platform, but that should be kind of the range. Saying whether we can continue in the 7% range, we're not saying that in our organic core. We've said victory for us is mid-single digits and that's what we're sticking with right now. If we do better in antibodies, if we start taking more share, things could be better. It's just like Jim said, it's not time to claim any victory lap yet, that's for sure. But we are really happy with the quarter. It's obviously a lot better than last quarter. For the year we're right on track with where we told everybody we'd be at and at mid-single digit level in our core. And so we're excited, we're happy. We don't have really any homework to do in the core side, everything is looking good. Even as of last we talked about the assays and ELISA being kind of a drag, this year, they've done a lot better. I think a lot of it's market as well. Everybody is looking pretty good this quarter. So, again, no victory lap. We're just happy to be in upper end of path. James T. Hippel - CFO, VP-Finance & Principal Accounting Officer : I'd add a modeling aspect of it is, two things just to make sure and also being mindful of; one is of course the FX impact and making sure we're taking in account the bottom line impact is a very, very high dropthrough for us on that FX impact. And that's going to definitely be with us at least for the first six months of fiscal year 2016. And where rates go from there, we'll see. But that's one item. The other item I'd mentioned is the fact that we had one month in fiscal year 2015 that we did not own ProteinSimple. And in that one month, given how that instruments business works, it's very, very light on revenue, but still has the cost burden of its SG&A and R&D run rate. And so that one month worth of cost was not in our fiscal year 2015 numbers, but will be in our fiscal year 2016. And the same goes for CyVek, where we purchased CyVek outright in November of fiscal year 2015. So there's a good four months of their SG&A, R&D costs in our first four month run rate that's not in fiscal year 2015 that will be 2016. I just would ask you to be mindful of those two items. Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Good catch, Jim. Jeff T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Good. Thanks, guys. Operator : And our next question is going to come from Drew Jones from Stephens. Please go ahead. Garrett Ryan Phelps - Stephens, Inc.: Hi, guys. This is actually Garrett on for Drew. But first question. You talked about placement strength with Simple Wes in the quarter. Was any of that seen on the academic market? Did you kind of... Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'm sorry, Garrett, you're breaking up. We can't understand the question. Garrett Ryan Phelps - Stephens, Inc.: Hear me better now? Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, that's better. Garrett Ryan Phelps - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Hi, guys. This is Garrett on for Drew. You talked about the Simple Wes placement strength in the quarter. Did you see any of that coming from the academic market as you kind of talked about addressing that market with ProteinSimple in the past? Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It's been even mix. So one of the major factors of us even making the acquisition, if you might recall, with ProteinSimple was that the desktop platform, the Wes, would find a significant following with academia because we were concerned academia wouldn't make the switch, and they did. Half their sales have been roughly with academia and I do believe that is continuing about the same trend. Garrett Ryan Phelps - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Great. And then also just on China, given the strength we've seen in the quarter, is this something where you think that strength will continue given more released funding or is this kind of a flood coming through of the funding that you saw in the quarter? Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We were pretty bullish all last year, even when others were flat to low-single digits, we still on strong double-digit growth. And we're largely a run rate business there. And not having instruments ship, (28:51) that's probably part of it. But we're still very much in an expansion mode. And while we're near 100 people, we're still in the front end of our opportunities in China. So as we open and grow in Beijing and other cities, I think we're going to find more growth as these institutions keep driving for healthcare. I think the audit activities are probably progressing and travelling from this space to the next space they want to look at in terms of markets. And I think we're moving through that. I think the next riff of course is their market in general, with everything crashing over there and the government stepping in. I think there's a lot of unknowns for all of us if any of that's going to trickle down into the way purchasing happens within these programs they're funding. Right now we believe and we hear that all funding in these areas is still there, still strong, as it was through the audit (29:43) operations this year, it's just people waiting for the process from the government how to actually spend the money. They're putting in place templates and processes actually how to account for their funding, which they didn't have a lot of controls before. So, now they do. So, I think if all those controls get put in place, we'll probably see maybe hope for some of that pent-up funding we could see come forward. For us to say we're going to do better than 25% growth, probably not. We're going to stick with we hope to be in that range for the foreseeable future, which we think is pretty darned good growth rate. We're just really ecstatic that we had a quarter at 35%. And I could just tell you that the team is really a great team, really jazzed. We had zero attrition in over a year in our China team. I mean, kind of unheard of. So that's how happy they are. We're getting them a new site again. They've outgrown the other one. They were only in it for like two years. We're merging that team with the ProteinSimple team, which is also growing and building over there. So we have a full-fledged company there with demo capabilities and everything else. So that's all coming in the coming year. So they're happy, they're excited, they're young. But it's a nascent market and industry, as we all know. And we're trying to ride that wave as best we can. Garrett Ryan Phelps - Stephens, Inc.: All right. Thanks, guys. Operator : And our next question is going to come from (31:08). Please go ahead. He disappeared. One moment. And our next question is going to come from Karen Padgett from Bio-Techne. Please go ahead. Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hello, Karen. Might be a mistake. She's probably listening in but... Operator : And our next question is going to come from John Souter from Rail-Splitter. Please go ahead. Your line is live. Mr. Souter, did you have a question? Our next question is going to come from Paul Knight from Janney Montgomery. Please go ahead. Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Hi, Chuck. I think everybody's confused on the star 1 or 1 star. We figured it out now. Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We know you know how to do this, Paul. Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : How big is China do you think? Can you say? Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: How big. What do you mean? Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : $30 million revenue, is it $35 million? Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think all-in this year we're in the $35 million-ish range, with ProteinSimple and everything in. We're mid to high $20 million in the core reagent side of the business. Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : And on ProteinSimple, what are people saying? What would be their complaint or what do you see is the issue? Is it not enough people on the ground, is it applications? Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think it's just, as I said, it was a bit of perfect storm. We had a plan in the low-double digit growth because it was a 48% growth comp from last year. We had a backlog issue to clear out from the quarter before on some of the, it's called running buffers, they're reagents that work with the system. That's all been corrected. Remember, that whole company, whole business moved to a new building in the past year. And there were a lot of new building start-up issues which were all \u2013 we're through all that. The FX piece is a strong component. When you're in the instrument business, these are big ticket items. There's a lot of currency issues in Europe around that, so that was a hit for the quarter. That, too, has come around. And we have had some commercial turnover. Terry had the commercial of the company before moving on six months to nine months ago. We've had to transition through that. We've gone with an incumbent, actually the person that trained in Terry years ago as Head of Commercial for the company now. She has 20-some years experience. She's wonderful we think and knows all the people. And we're filling in around that. And then on the other operations side, with one of my people from my past at Thermo Fisher, in operations I think we're on track. For us, always was, always probably will be and was the plan going forward, our deepest concern was the R&D team. The development team, with this young company with this strong pipeline of technology and new products and that we preserve that and we preserve all of that. We've had zero attrition there on the R&D front, with Bob Gavin the head of that and running that business for us as the SVP of the division. And that's all gone very well. He's been in the role here for nine months or so. Very pleased with that. So it's just a lot of little things. Going forward, we do still think this is a 20% kind of grower. I do believe that it is probably more feet in the street is probably important. I think regionally for sure we've got some coverage issues to deal with. It is a very, very exciting platform, as I mentioned. With all these issues, we had a record quarter in our Simple Western in our Wes platform. So we're shipping a lot of systems now in the quarter and it's starting to scale. So the rest of the pipeline, it needs to get out. It's the bigger platforms we need to do a little better on and I think it's coming. So we'll watch it this quarter and have more input I guess. James T. Hippel - CFO, VP-Finance & Principal Accounting Officer : Hi, Paul. This is Jim. Just to clarify in case you're looking at this from a modeling perspective for China. A very good guess by Chuck on the $35 million. I actually have the exact numbers here in front of me. What we call our China region finished the year around $33 million. But that also includes that Taiwan and Hong Kong and it also includes products that are made in China that ultimately get exported out of China from PrimeGene. So from a modeling perspective, if you're thinking about Mainland China where the high organic growth is coming from, it's probably more in the mid to high $20 million. Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Okay, got it. And then lastly, Europe was a problem in the first quarter. I guess that's over now? Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: In the fourth quarter, last quarter, you mean? Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Sorry, in the March quarter. Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It was certainly a problem. It's less a problem this quarter. Is it over? Is Europe ever over? We're comfortable saying that we think we've seen the coming back of lot of projects with our Biotech pharma, our largest customer base in the German region. So I can say right now on that, we like what we see. The numbers are improving. It was still a low-negative single-digit drag, but that's a lot better than double-digits like last quarter. Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Did the quarter's orders finish stronger, or was it even throughout the period? Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: They finished strong at the end of the quarter. It's definitely been a trend. Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Okay. Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Another quarter or two and we hope to have Germany something like last year. Remember, last year was double-digit growth and so it is a little bit cyclical there. Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Lastly, what do you think market growth is for your core Protein ELISA business, antibody business? Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I think as a composite in the market is probably 5% to 6%. I think the best one, of course, are antibodies. We did all the primary research, like you guys do, it's high-single digits. And Proteins we think are 2% to 3% as a market, being the smallest market of the bunch. We've been in the mid-single digits. We definitely think we've been taking some share back the last couple years from these ankle biters that have been chasing us. Our brand new strategies I think are working. We think the website has been phenomenal. Our traffic and our orders are up 8% in only in the first month of this new website. And I think I'd tell you that the website previously was about flat the two years I've been here. So we had immediate response on the new website. And, again, that's coming off a lot of the infrastructure, the process system, tools and experience the Novus team brought with them, who already run this whole thing for us now. And it's been really wonderful, on time, on target, on budget. And I hope the growth in the traffic keeps going. Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is going to come from Amanda Murphy from William Blair. Please go ahead. Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. So just a couple on the competitive dynamics. So I appreciate all the commentary around the antibody business and it sounds like Fisher is doing pretty well for you. But have you seen any change \u2013 it sounds like you're gaining share, but any change in terms of pricing from any of the competitors? And then I guess you mentioned some pricing pressure in the blood glucose segment, so maybe just talk a little bit about that as well. Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'll go in reverse. The glucose is kind of old history, it's old news. That really happened almost a full year ago and we kind of worked through it. Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Jim's comment was really quarter-on-quarter the same. So we're through that. It's almost a last man standing kind of strategy here. So we don't think there's a lot more downside, one of the reasons we bought the business. And for us, it's all about building out that funnel to ever-increasing content. It's a bit of a super specialized high-content packaging organization with high volume processes, so we love it for that. And the other side, antibodies, I would say no overall pricing differences there. We're still building who we are in antibodies. We're not at the same level of clout that we are in Proteins, of course. We are probably officially the largest supplier in the world right now, but that's not to say that we're maybe selling the most. We have processes and a website and everything including a wonderfully trained Fisher channel to now move things along and I think it's working. We had the best quarter so far with Fisher. They just keep getting better, so we'll keep feeding that beast and hopefully it keeps working well. They're very committed to us. They're very good with our teams. We've had absolutely no channel conflict. It's been marvelous to watch how we all work together on that. They really like having us on board as a partner and as (40:27). Content rules in this space. It helps to pull through all the other million products they do, so it's a good thing for all of us. Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC: So net-net, the market share gains were driven by Fisher and then the website. Is that fair? Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I would say less the website. It's been a month. Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yeah. Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Giving some good initial data, but it isn't material yet probably. Fisher definitely helped on the academic side in the quarter, no doubt about it. Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. Okay. And then just last one on the ProteinSimple side. I don't think you guys talked specifically about the whole revenue synergy opportunity and what that added, if anything, in the quarter. Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: For like the antibody catalogue? Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC: Exactly, yeah. Charles R. Kummeth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It's growing. It's still not material enough to say. Again, no victory lap here either. We are over 800 antibodies now. We're on track for over 1,000 end of the year annual here. And we like what we see. I think this is the kind of thing that takes some time. You're trying to woo academics mainly online into taking \u2013 going after your certification process. We're getting traction and it's going the right direction. I think it's the right strategy and for us it's probably all incremental growth. So that's important. Amanda, the other revenue synergy that's much harder to measure is how much of additional instruments we're selling because there's an antibody solution geared for it. And it doesn't really show up in the numbers either, so it is hard to measure. But we believe that the combined offering helps both sides of the business, no doubt. Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you. Operator : There are no questions in queue at this time. James T. Hippel - CFO, VP-Finance & Principal Accounting Officer : All right. Well, I want to thank everybody for joining in. The number of people listening in here is increasing every quarter. We're happy to see that and see the interest and the following. We're excited and happy about our quarter and we hope to keep delivering for you. And we'll see you again next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for joining this conference call. You may all disconnect. And I hope you have a wonderful day.",

And welcome to the Bio-Techne Earnings Conference Call for the First Quarter fiscal 2016. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the call will be open for the questions following management's prepared remarks. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jim Hippel, Chief Financial Officer. James Hippel : Good morning and thank you for joining us. Also on the call this morning is Chuck Kummeth, Chief Executive Officer of Bio-Techne. Before we begin, let me briefly cover our Safe Harbor statement. Some of the remarks made during this conference call may be considered forward-looking statements. The company's 10-K for fiscal year 2015 identifies certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected any forward-looking statements made during this call. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of any new information or future events or developments. The 10-K as well as the company's other SEC filings are available on the company's website within its Investor Relations section. During the call, non-GAAP financial measures may be used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. Tables reconciling these measures to most comparable GAAP measures are available in the company's press release issued early this morning or on the Bio-Techne Corporation website, at www.biotechne.com. Also you will notice this morning's press released the stock based compensation expense as an added as an adjustments to the company's non-GAAP measures. This will be an ongoing adjustment as stock based compensation expenses are recurring to increase transparency of these costs as well as to reflect net earring for more represented of the ongoing cash generated earnings of the company. All comparisons since the prior periods reflect this adjustment as well. With that, I will turn the call over to Chuck. Charles Kummeth : Thank you, Jim and good morning, everyone, thanks for joining us today for our first quarter call. This morning, we reported a 4% increase in revenue for the first quarter, with solid organic growth in most of our end markets. Total company organic growth was 2% for the quarter were mid single-digit organic growth from our biotechnology segment and 10% organic growth from our Protein Platforms segment were tempered by the timing of OEM shipment at our Clinical Control Segment. In our Biotech business our Bio Pharma end market continue performed very well but overall organic growth on a high single-digit. Europe Bio Pharma market was particularly strong seeing nice rebound even in Germany. Overall Europe organic growth was in a mid single-digit or Germany \u2013 Germany leading a way without team. An increasingly bigger driver of our growth and above for market has been our sort of efforts to marketing in customer region and ask this solutions for these customer. Our expertise are producing complex bioactive molecules and our reputation for quality it will increase be in recognize by our biopharma capital by choosing us to give us interesting producing results. Not only these arrangements contribute to our current role but we also further depending on our relationships with customers it should enabled collaboration on project and years to come. Many of these products developed as any incorporated into our standard catalogue. Meanwhile in our academic and government end markets we continue to experience our multi quarter trends to modest organic growth with first quarter growth in a low single-digit after the release of our new website at the end of Q4 fiscal year 2015 website traffic is increase. Our work improves the website experience with the ongoing especially as per teams to adding more product content in the form of data or reference those in change optimization. We believe this is the key to long-term growth in the academic market especially we read about it. When we look at our results in Asia the story as much as same that it was for Q4, China continue to perform very well in Q1 with organic growth in the mid-teens. Our China for China strategy continuous to bare through with our PrimeGene products made and sold them in China domestic market digit growth are nearly 40%. In the Pac Rim organic growth excluding Japan was in mid-teens. However Japan continuous to be drag on a regional double-digit negative growth both this stocking by distributor and driven by extreme change rate fluctuation in the flow where is the research funding by the Japanese government as resulting perfect to for several quarters right now. We thought we would be pass to starting fiscal year 2016 but Q1 proved otherwise. We still believe both of these issues are temporary and we will see rebound in fiscal 2016. In meantime, we have made an addition to our leadership team in Q1 about \u2013 further the Vice President of all of Asia Pacific. His name is Peter Breloer. He will be based in Hong Kong. Peter brings more than 20 years experience in managing the region for other global companies such as Thermo Fisher Scientific and 3M. With Peter's expertise and leadership, we will be well-positioned together with our local teams to capture growth in the region with initial focus on maximizing the growth potential in China, recapturing growth and funding returns in Japan and eventually establishing beachhead growth in India. Moving on to our Clinical Controls division, we completed our acquisition of Cliniqa in early July. Cliniqa specializes in manufacturing commercialization of quality control and calibrators as well as bulk reagents used in clinical diagnostic market. Its controls and reagents are used in a wide variety of diagnostic tests for such pathologies as cardiac disease, diabetes, cancer, immunological disorders, therapeutic drug monitoring, urine analysis and toxicology. Additionally, with over a 165 products with 510(k) clearances from U.S. FDA Cliniqa has developed a significant regulatory experience that can potentially leverage expand other Bio-Techne product into the clinical diagnostic market. We are excited to have Cliniqa as part of Bio-Techne to expand our product offerings to our clinical controls and diagnostic customers, virtually to same customer that are existing from the Clinical Controls business... With the acquisition of Cliniqa, the Clinical Controls segment revenue was higher for the quarter compared to last year. Organic revenue order was lower due to timing [indiscernible] and shipment. Despite the lower organic revenue in the quarter, our outlook for this business remains solid as ever. Our legacy hematology controls business grew in mid single digit this quarter, we believe this portion of our business whose product have a short shelf life represents end user demand for clinical controls product. The blood glucose, blood gas and now blood chemistry and diagnosing biomarker which Cliniqa brings has much longer shelf by which now \u2013 while will allow willing customers buying bigger bulk commodity. The bulk nature of these sales makes the volume volatility from quarter-to-quarter. However, our close relationships with these customers as the critical supplier of this controlled visibility to their ordering schedule. For up to the next 12 months an insight in the overall health of this business and its trajectory currently have visibility of these ordering schedules together with the key one performance of our legacy hematology control. This is confidence that this division will continue to be at least mid-single-digit annual grower in long-term. Lastly our Protein Platforms segment ended Q1 with a 26% increase from revenue growing 10% organically while the growth of division was expectable, we still believe it should will and will get better. As we stated in our Q4 call, there were several setbacks in the fourth mostly related the integration of CyVek in commercial attrition. While the integration setbacks have been solved and commercial openings have been filled, it takes more than a quarter for a larger new commercial team to refill order pipeline. We are also using this opportunity with a new sales force and sales leader to rethink how to just go to market to capture majority of the western blot user is of course focusing on nearly adapted the prior ProteinSimple sales engine will accept the deal. This involves how to best generate leads and close sales. Utilizing the power of the entire R&D systems commercial team to help generate leads and performing demos to close certain sales are examples of actions that are being aggressively taken. We just finished our annual strategic planning session with our leadership team. From that nothing has changed in our view of the market potential for this game changing platform solutions and our teams are committed to ever to make sure our customer is benefited from us for years to come. Finally I want to briefly comment on the operating margin performance of the company in Q1. Jim will provide the details by segment later but for the overall company, the entire operating margin reduction from last year is attributable to the timing of the acquisition we made last year and to a lesser extent FX translation study. ProteinSimple was acquired at the end of July last year, being an insulin business very little of any quarter's revenue is recognized in its first month of quarter. As in our Q1 result this year, we recognized an additional month of SG&A and R&D expenses burden in our P&L with very little revenues to go along with it. We also acquired CyVek in November of Fiscal Year 2015 as we have made it clear in past calls this is essentially a starter business with very little revenue contribution that won't likely breakeven until sometime in Fiscal Year 2017. And in clinical control of [indiscernible] we completed the acquisition of Cliniqa in July of this fiscal year, all those businesses are profitable but does not yet have the margin contribution of our existing and more established clinical control businesses. The optics film was good this quarter, but the underlying trailing 12 month operating performance for these businesses are improving and they will continue to improve as a growing prosperous part of Bio-Techne. Now before I turn the call over to Jim I want to revise more colors on the leadership position still this quarter. I mentioned in our press release this morning. As we discussed some prior calls, our overall strategy is provided game changing solutions to our customers through innovation. Some of this innovation will come from us and some will come from acquisition we make. But we have there successful \u2013 the culturally organization must afford collaboration with one, another whether in different department, different business, in different cities or different country. The company is going to be doubled in employees in past two last year and fund group of the number of locations where employees reside. It helps us to create a culture that nurtures collaboration. We've hired a new VP of human resources, transformation and integration who have experienced in change management. I mentioned this on the prior call, but one to give it, further mention here is the traditional healthy sales in Q1. His name is [indiscernible] he has relocated to [indiscernible] Minneapolis, from UK to join our Executive team. Prior to joining by [indiscernible] global consulting business, focus on helping companies and individual manage to change. I worked with through and through over a decade and have some appreciated very unique skills and ability. As I said in the last quarter's call, the common -- test for Bio-Techne will be directly related to how fast we can get businesses and teams working together, collaborating and leads in complete solution further comprising both reagents and instruments in our strategic markets, focusing on management change, culture and collaboration to accelerate our scientific study. We are very excited to have various partners part of the team who will make us call better. With Peter [indiscernible] on Board our executive leadership team is now complete. Many of this joined Bio-Techne come from much larger organizations, had much bigger jobs in terms of revenue requirements over time. They are here because they see the potential, the comments and exciting to building an epic company that enable -- science. With that, I will turn the call over to Jim for more detail on the financials before we open the line up for Q&A. Jim? James Hippel : Thank you, Jeff. As on prior earnings calls, I will provide an overview of our Q1 financial performance for the total company and then provide some color on each of our few study. As mentioned in this morning's press release, a slight modification of our stagnant reporting again this current quarter. This modification is the movement of the company's Bio-specific business and the biotech segment -- completely shows that the recent acquisition of Cliniqa and its commonality a customer end market for Bio-specific influence this management and the employee change. All comparisons to prior periods will reflect the new reporting structure as this existed in the prior reporting period. So starting with the overall financial performance for the first quarter. Adjusted earnings was down approximately 10% to prior year with 29.4 million, Bio adjusted EPS was $0.79 a share versus $0.88 in the prior year. The impact of currency translation was a headwind to EPS by about $0.03. Under GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.61 compared to $0.64 prior year. On the top line Q1 reported sales were $112.4 million, an increase of 4% year-over-year with organic growth of 2%. First quarter sales include approximately 6% growth from acquisition and a 4% impact from foreign exchange. Moving on to the details of the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin came in at 70.6% in Q1, down 150 basis points from the prior year. Approximately one-third of this decrease is due to impact of currency translation and the remaining decrease is due to product mix exchange associated with the acquisition that occurred since last year. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and effect quarter gross margin modestly improve year-over-year in the first quarter. Adjusted SG&A in Q1 was 23.2% of revenue and R&D was 10.1% of revenue, 360 basis points and 100 basis points higher than last year, respectively. The increases in these operating expenses were driven by the acquisitions made since beginning of the first quarter of last year. And that have increased adjusted operating expense for quarter due the organic net investment was under $1 million. Resulting adjusted operating margins for Q1 was 37.3%. Adjusted operating margins excluding the impact of acquisitions and FX were approximately flat compared to Q1 of last year. Looking at our numbers below operating income, net interest expense in Q4 was 0.4 million compared to 0.1 million of net interest expense last year. The increase is the result of dropdown and our line of credit that was partial used the funding acquisition in month of July. For the down of P&L adjusted other non-operating income first quarter was 1.2 million compared to 0.5 million of non-operating expense in prior year quarter. The improvement on this line is due to favorable transactional currency exchange fluctuation. Our adjusted effective tax rate in Q1 was 30.9%, up 20 basis points from first quarter of last year due to acquisition mix. In terms of returning capital, we continue to pay our dividend in paid our 11.9 million the quarter. Average diluted shares were up less than 200,000 shares in the first quarter but there is 7.3 million shares outstanding representing less than 1% dilution from last year as a result of stock option grants. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet $31.8 million of cash was generated from operations in the first quarter and on our investment in capital expenditures was $6.1 million. We ended the year with $83 million of cash and short-term available-for-sale investments, down $24 million sequentially from the end of Q4 since the year 2015. Our long-term debt obligations at the end of Q1 stood at $164.4 million an increase of $52.4 million from the end of Q4. Both of decrease our cash position and the increase in our debt obligation were driven by the acquisition of clinical this quarter. That rest of my comments on a total company performance for first quarter now I'll discuss the performance of our three business segments, starting with the Biotechnology segment. Q1 reported sales were $75.7 million, with organic growth of 4%, foreign exchange impact with reported sales growth negatively by approximately 5%. By geography, both the U.S. and Europe increased in the mid single-digits organically with Biopharma sales continued to be strong with growth in high single digits and academic and government growing modestly in a low single-digit. China experienced solid organic growth in the mid-teen while Pacific Rim was down 8% year-over-year. As Chuck noted earlier, excluding Japan, the Pacific Rim grew approximately in mid-teen. Adjusted operating income for the Biotech segment increased \u2013 decreased 3% in Q1 compared to the prior year and adjusted operating margin was 51.9%, a decline of 100 basis points year-over-year. Foreign exchange currency translation impacted adjusted operating income negatively by 7% and operating margin negatively by 150 basis points. Thus about the impact of the FX, adjusted operating income growth this quarter is commensurate with organic revenue growth. Turning now to our Clinical Controls segment sales in Q1 were 20.4 million, with reported growth of 7% over last year. The acquisition of Cliniqa accounted for 18% of the growth, while organic revenue declined 11%. As Chuck has discussed, the decline in organic revenue was due to the timing of OEM shipment schedules, and therefore we believe is not indicative of the current market conditions or future revenue growth expectations for this division. Adjusted operating income for the segment decreased 23% in Q1 and adjusted operating margin was 23.1%, a decrease of 890 basis points from the prior year. The decrease in adjusted operating income was directly attributable to the loss contribution margin on lower product sale. Meanwhile the lower adjusted operating margin is attributable approximately 50-50 to lower volume leverage of fixed cost and the acquisition of Cliniqa. It currently has a lower margin profile in our organic business today. Actually we expect these margins to improve substantially in larger OEM orders we ship later in the year. Moving on to our Protein Platform segment, where net sales in Q1 were 16.3 million and reported growth was 26%. Revenue from acquisition which for ProteinSimple was the month of July and for CyVek was the entire quarter accounting for approximately 21% of growth. The negative impact of that tax translation declined revenues by 5% and the organic growth was 10%. Organic growth in the quarter was driven by the Biologics product line as well as by consumable sales within Simple Western product line. Adjusted operating profit for Q1 was the negative 1.2 million compared to positive 2.6 million one year ago. As Chuck explained earlier, the additional month we earned ProteinSimple this year that's in July, had relatively small sales as many instrument businesses due in the first month of the quarter. The month of July still had a full SG&A and R&D expense run rate as the following. Also the operating expenses of CyVek were not in our figures last year on Q1 with the backward [indiscernible] success last November. Thus ProteinSimple's July results together with CyVek's Q1 results added 2 point million of revenue for the quarter year-over-year, a decrease adjusted operating income by approximately 3.9 million. The first quarter fiscal year is historically the lowest revenue quarter for the year for this business. Thus, we expect Protein platform to be profitable for the full year as revenue increase is sequentially in following quarters. That concludes my prepared comments. And with that I will turn the call back over to Tina to open the line up for some questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is going to come from Dan Leonard from Leerink. Please go ahead. Dan Leonard : Thank you. So first of on your operating margin, you've talked in past excluding further acquisition you expect this business to be about a 40% operating margin business. I just want to clarify is that \u2013 does that expectation now include or exclude stock on? James Hippel : It excluded before and it excluded now. So.. Dan Leonard : So it's a cash number. James Hippel : Right. Dan Leonard : Okay. And then my follow-up question, Chuck can you give us some may be little bit more color about how we should think about the cadence of the Protein Platforms business throughout the year? Charles Kummeth : So -- ramp in the north direction ultimately here. So we had as we talked for last quarter earlier set back was commercial order base, and we lost roughly 50% of the sales force and in that transition in an operation. But half that was expected and startups in the Silicon Valley you know people move on and there is all that to think about. We definitely had some turn over, there is a lot of we grow as well. We definitely change our sales force. We have new leader and new overall operation leadership that I talked before. So we are kind of back full strength we need in quarter, sort to get back at it. We did much better job of leveraging the order invasion for instance that \u2013 using order invasion here R&D Systems since we have large customer base and loyal following and in the quality and how they help in collaboration and done together. There is more and more in that being put in to the models for how we go-to-market. Its \u2013 we also got get pretty good start this quarter. I think \u2013 I don't think it's going to take more than one quarter or maybe two when we get time back to I think we should this is mostly in the Western side, Biologic been strongest continued strong and no issues, as we see so far. So I think we should be ramping again that we had issues still a better quarter and in last quarter so we are on the way back I think. Obviously we want to get back 20% better kind of growth rate quarter-on-quarter and that's our goal and we do think that will achieve by year-end. Dan Leonard : That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is going to come from Amy Wang from RJ. Please go ahead. Charles Kummeth : Amy good morning. Unidentified Analyst : Yeah, me too. So I guess... Operator : Ms. Wang do you have a question? [Operator Instructions] Our next question is going to come from Jeff Elliott from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. Jeff Elliott : Good morning guys. And thanks for the color on the segment the moving pieces there. But I guess can you give additional color on the margin progression by segment through the rest of the year. I think a lot of them kind of struggle to model the first quarter, but how should we think about the margins progression through the rest of the year? Charles Kummeth : I'll let Jim handle that. James Hippel : Yeah. Hi, Jeff. So if you look at the price segment the way we think about it is our overall Biotech segment I think the margins where we are at today is consistent with where you are kind of expecting going forward, now they could go 100 basis points up perhaps in that range with no material difference in Biotech division going forward. From a CCD perspective, we have some of the OEM shipments come through that will have a nice pull through and leverage on margin. So I basically would say that our margin profile in that business should eventually creep up to the upper 20. It won't hit 30 because Clinic Care has the lower margin profile than other businesses did historically, but I'd say upper 20 a year is kind of our expectation. Jumping to Protein Platforms, again with the first quarter our national business team took to the lowest quarter, we should get some nice leverage pull through on that going forward. And margin expectation -- operating margin expectations would be in the mid-single digit I'd say. Jeff Elliott : Okay. That's helpful. And just on the revenue side given that the shift in revenue between the segments I guess can you give us an update on how we should think about the kind of the organic growth by segment over the next few quarters? Charles Kummeth : Organic growth I guess by Biotech we have been -- we've kind of been where we felt, we expect to be in mid-single digits, we will continue in that range for Biotech. There are other possible upside [indiscernible] new deals, new things we are working on, new products, new directional strategy, but mid-single digit is kind of there. I think again mid single-digits will be at or remain \u2013 slightly higher single digits in the clinical controls and that can take power pack with the OEM shipments. It's starting to hit already [indiscernible] this quarter, so I expect that to be kind of volumes set along. And the biggest and then of course is Protein Platforms as James just mentioned, it's about quarter come back here and it's the sales force where it gets back in here if we can hit back to them, the 20s are better and simple western platform, I think then we're back where we think, we need to be in mid teens to nearly 20 overall. It should be very possible, should be what we expect. We had a quarter last year at 30%. It fits so early in the cycle of this business of the company that it's hard to exactly to be. We expect 20 or better and we're issuing for more, we've got to get team in place the other time. It's a great platform. It's a great technology, before this business didn't even provide demos. It was just so kind of early adopter kind of driven the strategy and we have to get a change our policy. I think with more leverage with that phase and then agent's people involved with different types of models and demos and demos lastly put in place, the leverage we have \u2013 having 20 different sites [indiscernible] couple worldwide, we think we're going to have very good success. James Hippel : Jeff, the only thing to add is that \u2013 that double digit kind of growth rate, I would \u2013 I think I wouldn't model that expectation [indiscernible] . It was flat last quarter, 10 this quarter. It's almost aligned there at two points. Jeff Elliott : Got it. And just one quick last one from me, on the Japan business, I guess what gives you confidence that that's going to see some recoveries? Is it just what you are seeing on the government funding side, or there is something else there? Charles Kummeth : Really good question and we've dug into that hard. Overall [indiscernible] take out Japan it looks great, the best quarter we had in a while even for [indiscernible] it tells you how negative Japan was. We've already had Peter in there digging in. He has strong contacts as well obviously with his experience. This whole AMED thing or the consolidation of their three organizations that act like NIH does here, are coming out and they are supposed bearing fruit, we are losing our funding and going forward the next quarter and maybe the second quarter, after that there the restart happening. That gives us confidence. Two, there aren't any incumbent supplier there, everybody has to import in. So, they are running out of stock. There was a de-stocking issue it really happened for two or three quarters with the massive change in currency, but that's going to change and that's going to correct itself and we see some of that already. But it is definitely taking longer than we thought, it's Japan it always takes longer than we think in Japan is. My whole crew had this issue with Japan. We business [indiscernible] so we have to wait it out and it will recover. They have \u2013 they actually have a very strong funding cycle coming [indiscernible] just a matter of them being able to use it. We think. I have notice on other calls already other peer companies they are not talking a lot about Japan and other things it is not very good. I think their numbers reflected probably like ours. Operator : Okay. Our next question is going to come from Drew Jones from Stephens Incorporated. Please go ahead. Drew Jones : Thanks good morning guys. James Hippel : Good morning. Charles Kummeth : Good morning. Drew Jones : PrimeGene you guys have obviously been pretty strong there for the past year when some other tools companies have struggled, can you walk us through the confidence on why that's going to be sustain and should we expect an acceleration backup to the 20% level? Charles Kummeth : Sure. I'll give you at least some color on that. In the last quarter we had a \u2013 we have a really great quarter in China 35% increment. So these things do balance try a little bit, win a definite teams. We have some shifting in our portfolios well. We've recent plans lot of products over there with lots of different source of na\u00efve just rolling. PrimeGene piece is doing better than plan. It's doing wonderful, another quarter 40% fast growth China for China. Jim and I were just there month ago or so. We finish the new factory. It's GMP ready site. It's gorgeous. It is growing \u2013 their audits already happening, that's why people are going away. So it's going to continue to be like a R&D systems kind of branded that kind of organization there with quality been foremost. Although, it's PrimeGene China for China, people get it and we see no one up in that growth rate for that part of the business. Other part of PrimeGene is kind of OEM related and that's also been picking up. So we're very close to our acquisition model. We're right on release part on I think the PrimeGene going forward. Management, still although we haven't lost single person, we actually brought on one new scientist, very high level, very credited and we're building out and this is not the kind of site organization, everything is really going to attract more talent. Drew Jones : Okay. And then on the acquisition front, has there been enough multiple contraction over the past couple of months where there are some areas that you thought were out of reach that maybe are in play now? Charles Kummeth : This \u2013 no, I think this question has come up in lot of our peer calls and it's too early right. I mean, people absolutely better have. We're really happy that evaluation has come down a little bit and it is fixed year little change thinking but I think one or two quarters we are using enough for this kind of this kind of market memory to really integrated into our prices offering, prices expect this per acquisitions but overtime maybe there is still lot of deals up there we've got a lot \u2013 we've got a strong product and new offering and we are still looking and we are working on the always cautions and how we are \u2013 and however lot of these kind of synergies and they happy available cost and sales just more to come but we are not just pointing in the discounts we are seeing it now but we hope picture allowance. Drew Jones : Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question is going to come from Amanda -- Amanda Murphy from William Blair. Please go ahead. Amanda Murphy : Hey good morning guys. Just a follow-up question on ProteinSimple so in terms of that question as you know saw you talked about how some of that expected and obviously you've had some sales, you have some changes there but is there anything else that we should be aware of I don't know if there anything on a competitive landscape that's bring in terms of maybe people leaving before there or not is there anything else that might be driving any kind of equation? Charles Kummeth : That's really great question. We are asking here what else if you are worried about it's a Silicon Valley company I can tell you we talked and it was brought by actually two quarters or above you should help running buffer and those it will effected quality and then it maybe gave some scale to the market over already for active in this platform but already full result now for over a quarters but I think that's all behind it we don't see any issue around that we don't see any issue or roadmap the roadmap and all the platform we have are solid on track its more now since coming. The team, the development team is 100% intact. It's been intact nothing has changed, run by [indiscernible] vendors since beginning this company and its going extremely well. I don't see any other real catches or risks outside of the commercial risk right now. And I think even there we feel really very good. We have getting the team back to full strength with 6% reduction over six months period not a small task. Now it's not a big company the overall commercial innovation for 100 people, talking about 25 to 30 reps overall doing -- supporting and those are all back. We are also shifting around a little bit the way the organization is structured. So you have reps and you have technical service type people, work people and some of that varies by kind of phase you are in cycle, product cycle. You want to go to a more of a demo driven cycle and more support you change, so again some of the changes while we should get [indiscernible] I won't see . Amanda Murphy : Got it. Okay. Thanks. And then obviously the question usually one of these earnings is around kind of purchasing pattern that is some of the smaller buyer tech means and you talked about that segment generally being pretty strong. But I don't think you have kind of exposure to the techno companies, but can you just kind of refresh a memory there what you are seeing just going forward on some of the smaller biotech companies R&D type spending patterns? Charles Kummeth : For my understanding your question, here you are asking about the spending patterns in smaller biotech companies and we are seeing in respect of our own spending? Amanda Murphy : Yeah, just I mean, obviously given the volatility and there is just some concern that ultimately -- that would impact what types of dollars Biotech companies are spending and I don't think you guys have specifically a kind of exposure to those types of name but I just wanted to clarify that and like that. Charles Kummeth : There's not any real rate slide coming to offer new warnings [indiscernible] give us any cause to react. Amanda Murphy : Yes. Okay. And then just last one on the OEMs shipments. I think you said business deal [indiscernible] those come through the P&Ls but those going to be primarily in the next quarter or should we think about that as more of projected dynamic? Charles Kummeth : Nice trends [indiscernible] answer. Some couple of days this quarter, we better teach our brand new young hunk acquisition of what's likely to be in a public company. Amanda Murphy : Okay. James Hippel : Miss your orders like two days in this quarter, so we're now -- we'll continuing got some more work to do there. So overall, if we try to get transparency, we're in the past we've talked about the new hematology control things seem so stable on such a stable grow and now it's to be lumpier because there's much more OEMs percentages in the business. So I think it will be a little more volatile, but still overall I think much less volatile like commission as far. At the end of this quarter we'll shift any more OEMs, the next quarter hope not. So hopefully this is availability to catch up quarter of fact. But I want to make a very clear the outlook with Clinical what we \u2013 what they hold this, what we bought, what we model this for what they have in their pipeline is all right on track and in fact they finished their business last year, their 40% organic growth rate and looking for being 10% or better like this year. So it should be helpful. It's going to take a sort of while to get their margins as where we like it and talked about being a little less, there's some work to do, but and may be long-term as its sales that maybe won't have margins of our hematology control, but it's a solid business with good potential to remain at double-digit growth. Charles Kummeth : Little more specific Amanda on the quarterly profile, I mean right now, the way the schedule looks that second quarter and the fourth quarter, will be stronger than the first and third by that \u2013 I don't know, it's always have to change there. And the more interesting things we bring in and it will be more and more like that. Amanda Murphy : And that the OEM lumpiness dynamic that's purely there Bio-Cliniqa? Charles Kummeth : Yeah, Cliniqa as well as our legacy diagnostic business. Amanda Murphy : Okay. Yeah. Okay. Thanks very much. Charles Kummeth : It's the same sign of reasons, big joint customers, big OEM orders. Amanda Murphy : Yeah. Charles Kummeth : Probably [indiscernible] taking order, right? Amanda Murphy : Got it, thank you. Operator : [Operator Instruction] Our next question is going to come from Paul Knight from Janney Montgomery. Please go ahead. Paul Knight : Hi, Chuck, how are you? Charles Kummeth : Great, Paul, how are you doing? Paul Knight : Good, I don't need to press star one or just press one in the future. You'd mentioned Jim, the talk around the gross margin impact from these OEM \u2013 I am sorry, from the ProteinSimple costs and shipments et cetera, you've mentioned there is a gross margin impact number, what was that both from diagnostics and from ProteinSimple? Charles Kummeth : What I can \u2013 may help you with is that for the Protein platform segment, gross margin basis if we put margins by over 300 basis, the acquisitions in. Paul Knight : Okay. Charles Kummeth : In platforms. And then for our \u2013 for our clinical control division the gross margin impact of the acquisition was actually pretty nil. It's actually slightly positive impact on the gross margins but on the operating margin there was over 300 basis \u2013 almost 400 basis points. Paul Knight : Okay. Very helpful. Thank you. And then where do you think you are on your online capabilities right now, well Abcam is being doing this strategy a long time I know you've been building that capability up? Are you in the first innings the third innings what's your comfort level with this go to market strategy? Charles Kummeth : Let's start talking about our need two years ago that really get back in the game with website that gives a customer experiences that something better than it was. I would say we are probably a decade behind a good 10 years by Abcam because they had entered for the long-time. In these two years, we come a long way I would say we're probably only six years behind. We caught up two extra years probably. It's there, a long ways ahead. And it's not \u2013 it's not in the amount of products, we actually have more products but they've spend a long time winning data, reference citation, online and we've growing as best as we can, we actually thing our website is \u2013 our search kit is best out there right now. It's just the matter of now backing up those bones with the right content and that will take time. With the Novus Group here and they are in the overall doubling of our IT group in order to handle all this, we're on acceleration mode. But innings wise, if we are talking baseball it's probably third innings, fourth innings at best. The best is yet to come. And we've seen results I mean the Academia is definitely improving. And [indiscernible] which didn't have a greatest quarter by the way for us, but it is developing and it is noticeable and I mentioned our traffic is us the website had immediate effects there and it's early I think the opening is still really early to be honest. Paul Knight : And then lastly, the level of contribution from acquired revenue in remainder of the year, what's your round number on that? Charles Kummeth : [indiscernible]? Paul Knight : Right. Inclusion of the future numbers. Charles Kummeth : Are you referring to Cliniqa? Paul Knight : Yeah. Charles Kummeth : You know what we'll tell you about Cliniqa is that Cliniqa when we acquired it was approximately of the size of Meldas. So that's kind of based on -- you can think about in terms of year. Paul Knight : Okay. Thank you very much guys. Operator : Our next question comes from [indiscernible] from Craig-Hallum Capital. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning, gentlemen. Just a couple of questions, first can you quantify or give us a ballpark for the OEM shipments that pushed from Q1 to Q2? You know we are talking about a couple million dollars or was it even more than that? James Hippel : We are pointing 2% organic, 3, 5 it would have been in the \u2013 or it should have been in the quarter five at least in this [indiscernible] , so we are talking of couple of million or little less. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And then with those sitting here it sounds like a majority any way in Q2, is that simply on top of kind of how we had modeled Q2 or does the push out to Q2 then you see a some delays in the reorders in Q2, so it actually not an additive situation. James Hippel : I will say in general that our profile right now for this division has a higher stake in revenue in Q2 and in Q4. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. All right and then one last one, as far as the new antibody, I saw press release the other day, you are up for 1,000 there. How should we be thinking about how those, how the [indiscernible] antibodies will ramp, I mean is it much like your old model, I mean almost annuity based stream or is it going to be a little lumpier with those products? James Hippel : I think it will be low and steady like we are known for. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Great. Thanks guys. Operator : There are no questions in queue at this time. [Operator Instructions] There are no questions in queue. Charles Kummeth : All right. Well thank you everyone for attending. Should be interesting quarter going forward. And we will be talking I am sure throughout the day here as well. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this completes your conference call. You may all disconnect. And have a great day.",

Baird Paul Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company Operator : Welcome to the Bio-Techne Earnings Conference Call for the Second Quarter of Fiscal Year 2016. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jim Hippel, Chief Financial Officer. Jim Hippel : Good morning. Thank you for joining us. Also on the call this morning is Chuck Kummeth, Chief Executive Officer of Bio-Techne. Before we begin, let me briefly cover our Safe Harbor statement. Some of the comments made during this conference call may be considered forward-looking statements, including beliefs and expectations about the Company's future results. The Company's 10-K for fiscal year 2015 identifies certain factors that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements made during this call. The Company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of any new information or future events or developments. The 10-K as well as the Company's other SEC filings are available on the Company's website within the investor relations section. During the call, non-GAAP financial measures may be used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. Tables reconciling these measures to most comparable GAAP measures are available in the Company's press release issued early this morning and on the Bio-Techne Corporation website at www.bio-techne.com. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Chuck. Chuck Kummeth : Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter conference call. This morning we reported revenue growth of 8% for the second quarter, with the majority of our end markets remaining strong organically and a solid contribution from our recent acquisitions. I'm extremely pleased with the achievement of 6% organic growth corporate-wide, with our core business growing organically at 7%. This reflects a strong contribution from both our biotechnology and clinical control segments. Protein Platforms remains in a recovery period. Although we're seeing increased commercial traction, this segment remains on track for a reacceleration in the second half of fiscal 2016. Starting with our biotechnology business, our biopharma end markets remain strong, with revenue increasing in the upper single digits for the quarter. Our biopharma customers continue to recognize the benefits of outsourcing the development of complex bioreactive molecules to Bio-Techne. Our reputation for high-quality proteins, antibodies and assays continues to drive additional custom reagent development for the biopharma customer set. This enables a more sticky relationship with our customers, creating opportunities to meet additional client reagent needs as the relationship evolves. Our academia and government end market grew in the low single digits, as it has for several quarters now. We believe one of the keys to driving long term growth within our academia customer base is the ongoing improvement of our website. Encouragingly, the recent enhancements to our Bio-Techne website are generating increased Internet traffic with both number of visits to our website and online ordering activity growing mid-single digits year over year. In fact, our Novus Biologicals brand which was the first of our brands to use the enhanced website, observed revenue growth in the high single digits this quarter as a result of the improved Web experience. The continued emphasis on search engine optimization and adding more product content to our website should continue to build revenue momentum from our academic markets going forward. Increases in NIH funding recently passed by Congress should also provide a modest tailwind. Europe performed well in Q2, with mid-single-digit growth that was broad-based in the region. Our European biopharma business was particularly strong, with its research cycle returning in fiscal 2016 generating growth in the low teens. Our commercial team has executed very well there, as this is the third consecutive quarter with mid-single-digit growth in Europe. China was a standout in the quarter, delivering another stellar performance with organic revenue increasing 30%. We continue to view China as very much an emerging market for life science reagents, especially for those provided by Bio-Techne. The increasing demand for health care will drive further investments in life science research, benefiting our still relatively nascent business in this geography. In the Pac Rim, Japan remains a drag on growth, with our Japanese business down mid-teens in the quarter, consistent with recent quarters where Japanese funding environment remains challenging. These issues are taking longer than expected to improve, although we're hearing that funding will begin to be released in February, representing a potential catalyst to return our Japanese business to growth by the end of fiscal 2016. Excluding Japan, our Pac Rim revenue increased upper single digits in Q2. Finally, I want to highlight the operational performance of our biotechnology segment, where we expanded operating margins in Q2 by over 150 basis points from the prior year. This expansion was driven by productivity actions and process improvements that still managed to find efficiencies in an already lean organization. The improvement is even more impressive, considering it overcame over 100 basis points of margin headwind due to unfavorable currency exchange. Overall, we're very pleased with the strong performance within our core biotech product portfolio, with Q2 representing the third consecutive quarter of at least mid-single-digit organic growth in our core business. Getting our core back to consistent, mid-single-digit growth has been the most challenging and complex part of our five-year strategic plan and I'm proud of our team's effort to get us there and I have confidence in our ability to maintain this momentum. Moving on to our clinical controls division, we experienced strong performance from both our organic and acquired businesses in the quarter. As a reminder, in Q1, our organic clinical controls division was unfavorably impacted by the timing of OEM delivery dates. As expected, these OEM orders were delivered in Q2, contributing to 10% organic growth for the quarter. Cliniqa, our controls and reagents supplier for the diagnostic market that we acquired last July, outperformed our expectations for the quarter and I believe we're in the early stages of leveraging the cross-selling opportunities that exist between this acquisition and our legacy clinical controls product line. That said, the addition of Cliniqa's reagent-based products introduces additional products with longer shelf life similar to our existing chemistry-based Bionostics product, allowing OEM customers to buy in bulk and increasing the potential for a quarter-on quarter segment volatility. Based on customer ordering patterns, we anticipate the revenue contribution from Cliniqa in Q3 and Q4 to look more like Q2 than Q1. Our legacy hematology controls business remains stable, growing mid-single digits. Given the relatively shorter shelf life of our hematology controls products, we view growth of these products as an indicator of stable underlying demand within our clinical controls end market. Based on stable underlying demand, our outlook for clinical controls remain unchanged and we anticipate annual segment growth to remain in the mid-single digits going forward. Lastly, our protein platforms business remains in a recovery period, with a low-single-digit decline in our organic business for the quarter, although total segment revenue increased 18% sequentially over first quarter results. I want to share some of the positive elements of our protein platforms segment that gives us additional confidence in this business during the second half of fiscal 2016. In addition to now having a complete, industry-experienced Simple Western sales force, we're leveraging the entire R&D systems commercial team to generate leads, cross sell and demo this game-changing Western Blot technology. In doing so, we expanded our pool of potential Simple Western customers by engaging with the vast majority of scientists who are more pragmatic about technology changes in their workflows versus the initial strategy of focusing on early technology adopters. We still feel that this innovative technology will achieve significant share in the Western Blot market that is currently dominated by time-consuming, manual and poorly reproducible process. Executing on our new commercial plan is beginning to bear fruit, with new lead generation growing 20% and a number of quotes increasing in the mid-teens year over year. We view these metrics as indicators of building interest and awareness in our protein platforms workflow solutions as we continue to anticipate at least double-digit growth for this segment beginning in the third quarter 2016. We're very pleased with the performance of this Simple Plex product line within protein platforms segment this quarter. As a reminder, this is the rebranded Cydex start-up business we acquired a year ago in November. The revenue ramp of this business consisting of the Ella line of multiplex ELISA instruments and associated assay cartridges remains in early stages, but we're clearly seeing growing interest from our customers for the workflow enhancements the Simple Plex testing platform delivers. During the quarter, we reached a milestone in the Simple Plex product line with Q2 representing the first quarter of double-digit Ella instrument placements. We believe we're in the very early stages of Ella instrument adoption and look to Simple Plex to become a significant revenue contributor in future quarters. While the protein platforms business slightly declined organically year over year, we view the sequential increase as well as strengthening sales indicators as signs that our revised commercialization strategy is gaining traction. Nothing has changed with respect to our favorable outlook for the segment. We're only one quarter into our upgraded sales force and new commercialization strategy and remain on track for a meaningful segment revenue acceleration beginning next quarter. With that, I will pass the call over to Jim for a more detailed review of the financials before we open up to Q&A. Jim? Jim Hippel : Thank you, Chuck. As on our prior earnings calls, I will provide an overview of our Q2 financial performance for the total Company and then provide some color on each of our three segments. Starting with the overall second quarter financial performance, adjusted earnings increased approximately 3% year over year to $32.8 million, while adjusted EPS was $0.88 a share versus $0.85 in the prior year. The impact of currency translation was a headwind to EPS by about $0.06. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.69 compared to $0.89 in the prior year. Although excluding the prior-year $8.3 million gain on our initial CyVek investment, GAAP EPS improved by $0.02 over second quarter fiscal year 2015. On the top line, Q2 reported revenue was $120.9 million, an increase of 8% year over year, with overall organic growth of 6%. Second quarter reported sales included 6% growth contribution from acquisition partially offset by a 4% unfavorable foreign exchange headwind. Moving on to details of the P&L, total Company adjusted gross margin was 70.8% in Q2, decreasing 20 basis points from the prior year. The year-over-year decrease reflects an unfavorable product mix due to the CyVek and Cliniqa acquisition and unfavorable FX. These are partially offset by strong productivity gains, primarily in our biotech division. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and FX, core gross margins improved 150 basis points year over year in the second quarter. In the near term, we anticipate gross margins to remain in the 70% to 71% range depending on the product mix. Adjusted SG&A in Q2 was 22.3% of revenue, 130 basis points higher than last year and R&D was consistent with the prior year at 9.1% of revenue. The increase over prior year was driven primarily by the acquisitions made since the beginning of the second quarter of last year. Modest investments, largely for commercial activities in China and protein platforms, have also been made. The resulting adjusted operating margin for Q2 was 39.4%. Excluding the impact of FX in acquisition, the operating margin in our organic business was 41.4%. This compares to an adjusted operating margin of 41% in the second quarter of last year, demonstrating the productivity and expansion of margins we delivered in our core businesses. Looking at our numbers below operating income, net interest expense in Q2 was $0.3 million, essentially flat to last year. Other non-operating expense for the quarter was also $0.3 million. This compares to $0.1 million of non-operating expense in the prior-year quarter, with unfavorable transactional FX explaining the year-over-year variance. Our adjusted FX tax rate in Q2 was 30.1%. That's down 20 basis points in the second quarter of last year. In terms of returning capital, we continue to pay our dividend and paid out $11.9 million in the quarter. Average diluted shares were up less than 100,000 shares over the year-ago period at 37.3 million shares outstanding. Turning to cash flow on the balance sheet, a record $38.5 million of cash was generated from operations in the second quarter and our investment in capital expenditures was $4.9 million. We ended the quarter with $113.9 million of cash and short term available-for-sale investments of $26.6 million sequentially from the end of Q1. Our long term debt obligations at the end of Q2 stood at $162.8 million, a decrease of $1.6 million from the end of Q1. Going forward, opportunistic M&A, our dividend and debt paydown remain our priorities for capital deployment. Now I will discuss the performance of our three business segments, starting with the biotechnology segment. Q2 reported sales were $75.9 million for organic growth of 7%, exceeding our expectations for the quarter. Foreign exchange negatively impacted reported sales growth by approximately 5%. We anticipate the biotechnology segment to continue to grow organically in the mid-single digits going forward. By geography, the U.S. grew upper single digits organically, with solid biopharma sales growth offsetting flattish academic results. Europe increased mid-single digits organically, with biopharma sales in this region increasing in the mid-teens, offsetting low single-digit growth in academia. China experienced very strong growth of 30%, while the Pac Rim declined upper single digits year over year, reflecting a mid-teens decline in Japan. As Chuck noted earlier, excluding Japan, the Pacific Rim grew in the upper single digits. Adjusted operating income for the biotech segment increased 5% in Q2 compared to the prior year and adjusted operating margin was 52.7%, an increase of 160 basis points year over year. Strong organic growth coupled with productivity initiatives more than cover the impact of negative foreign exchange to the bottom line. Excluding the impact of FX, adjusted operating income increased 11%, topping the segment's 7% organic revenue growth rate and operating margin would've been 53.9%. Turning now to clinical controls, segment sales in Q2 were $25.7 million, with reported growth of 49% over last year. The acquisition of Cliniqa contributed 39% to growth and organic revenue increased 10%. As expected, the timing of OEM shipment orders benefited the quarter, with some of the OEM order timing that impacted Q1 normalizing in the second quarter. Going forward, we expect OEM shipment orders in Q3 and Q4 to be commensurate with Q2, although changes to OEM ordering patterns could introduce potential quarterly variability to segment performance. In the long term, we continue to expect clinical control segment annual organic growth to be in the mid-single digits. Clinical control adjusted operating income increased 42% to -- in Q2, commensurate with the top-line growth. And adjusted operating margin was 28.4%, a decrease of 120 basis points from the prior year due to product mix. Moving on to our protein platforms segment, where net sales in Q2 were $19.3 million, declining 6% from the prior-year period. As a reminder, we have now completely annualized the ProteinSimple acquisition, so any associated revenue from this business is now included in our organic results. Revenue from CyVek continues to ramp and we reached a milestone of double-digit instrument placements in the quarter. Given the timing of the CyVek acquisition close last year, the contribution from acquisitions was less than 1% in the quarter. And favorable FX impacted revenues by 3%, leading to an organic segment revenue decline of 2%. Despite this decline resulting from the transition of commercial strategy, consumables sales from existing Simple Western instrument placements increased 20% in Q2 compared to last year, demonstrating that our customers really do see the value our technology brings to their workflows. This, together with a significant improvement in instrument sales lead generation and quote activity that Chuck mentioned earlier, gives us confidence in a return to double-digit growth in the back half of fiscal 2016. Adjusted operating income for this segment in Q2 was $1.5 million compared to $3.4 million one year ago. With the CyVek acquisition, foreign exchange and the organic growth decline explain the year-over-year variance. We continue to expect additional improvement in protein platforms profitability as segment growth improves in the second half of the fiscal year. That concludes my prepared comments. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Katina to open the line for some questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question is going to come from Dan Leonard from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Dan Leonard : Just want to dig into the protein platforms business a bit more. First off, do you have a book-to-bill number you could offer for that segment? Chuck Kummeth : No, we don't offer that kind of data. It's not really a -- like a mass spec to the business, where there's really heavy bookings front-end with it. We pretty much ship what we've build pretty quickly. Dan Leonard : And Chuck, can you characterize perhaps the new-product pipeline in that segment? Is there anything we should be looking forward to here in the next --? Chuck Kummeth : There is a lot of exciting news there. As you know, there are three different roadmaps of platforms in that company, that business,[indiscernible] with CyVek. And we just announced Maurice. We have a new biologics platform that allows us to look at size as well as charge. So it's a dramatic increase. It comes after, I think, five or six years of -- since the last major upgrade in that product line. And we already were experiencing solid growth. We're in high single-digit growth in that platform anyway. So we're really excited about it. And we just announced it last week, I think, maybe even two weeks ago, but initial interest has been nothing short of staggering. Dan Leonard : Okay. And then my final question, can you characterize the current M&A environment? Chuck Kummeth : Challenging. So, yes, I think we will need more time with this market. And with things settling back -- things have settled back for most biotechs in our space, but it takes more than a few months. Hopefully things will get a little cheaper. We participate in the Affy deal and hard to compete with big Thermo when they are interested. But we remain very engaged with a strong pipeline, a strong hopper and we're active in deals at this very moment as we always are. Operator : And our next question comes from Jeff Elliott from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. Jeff Elliott : Good morning. Nice quarter guys. First question for me is on the biotech business. Could you talk about what you're doing to improve margins there? You had some really strong improvement in the quarter, even despite the FX headwind. But what are the actions you are taking to drive margins there? Chuck Kummeth : Yes, you know, we've talked about this a lot in the past. And you know personally, when I joined a little less than [two] [ph] years ago, there was a lot to be done here operationally. I'm Six Sigma trained. We have a lot of people here that are, the new people that come in. We have a lot of strong operational leaders that come from much bigger companies running much bigger businesses and we're rigorous in reworking this thing and organizing into -- like as an example, dividing development away from manufacturing. So we actually have a factory part of the organization now in biotech. That allows the organization to work on productivity. And that part of the organization has done very well. We give them a challenge in every year's plan of how much productivity to find. And you break that down in creating projects to find it and then you work it every month. That's how everyone does it and that's how we do it, too. I'll give you one example. There was a lot of -- we're known for quality. We're known for our high bioactivity. We're known for superiority of our products and we test and test and test and test here. But we're probably bringing in a little of our testing theory, SC, statistical methods and that's also helping us out just to be a little more streamlined. There's just never been much done before. Even though it is very lean, there's still a lot of methodologies here that will help. We have brought in a lot of new systems, computers. We have an online product mapping system. I wouldn't call it an ELN per se, but when you generate over 1500 or 2000 new products a year, you have to have a system to manage all those to the pipeline. And that's an extensive internal IT system that we use and we've really improved that and made that much more -- just much more efficient for all employees to use in the lab, whether they are working in assays, whether they are working in antibodies, whether they are working in proteins and that's also helped. So, a lot of programs, a lot of projects. But, all in all, it's a great quarter. And consistently, we have been improving margins, as you have seen that year over year here. Jeff Elliott : That's great. In the prepared remarks, I think you mentioned the NIH funding increase this year. And I think you described the potential tailwind as modest. I guess why modest? It is a pretty big increase that the NIH has seen. Is that more of a timing impact or --? Jim Hippel : The budget is $31 billion, going up $2 billion. 3% last year to 6.5% this year. Some of that will find its way to us for sure. Everyone buys data on who gets what grants. There's thousands of grants given and we're trying to map those grants by the customers that are getting them as to what who are our customers to see if one institution is getting x amount more grants per this, how big a customer they are for us. But it's hard to quantify. We're sure we're going to have some tailwind from it. I would look at it as nothing more for now and be conservative. It's a nice buffer for us maintaining our mid-single-digit growth in this area. So at least we're not declining. We don't have to worry about compensating for any of that. It's definitely on the right direction. And with a full 6.5% increase in the budget, something should find its way to us. Hard to quantify. As we get further along here, though, this next quarter, we will try to have more data on that. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our next question is going to come from Paul Knight from Janney Montgomery. Please go ahead. Paul Knight : Couple of questions, number one, what steps are you taking in the ProteinSimple platform? Are you consolidating salespeople, hiring new ones, reassigning them, et cetera? Chuck Kummeth : All the above, but we have more or less overhauled our commercial organization. It was -- we had a lot of language in our prepared remarks today because of this situation. It's been an issue starting about two quarters ago. We're well over halfway through the process. We're really excited about what we're seeing, so we have basically rehired 60% or so of our Simple Western sales force in the last three to four months. They are all in place. They're all trained. We have everybody linked up through Salesforce.com and a pretty rigorous process for understanding how they are doing personally, individually, one by one in terms of lead generation and closing deals. And, as Jim put it in his remarks, we're seeing a lot of good evidence. Leads are up 20%. The pipeline is definitely filling again. Numbers are improving. It's a nine-month selling cycle. So there isn't any way to try to shortcut this. When you hire new people, you've got to start over with the accounts. And there was a big change in philosophy and marketing, too. When we bought ProteinSimple, it was very much a young, hip Silicon Valley company. And they are really focused on getting out this new, sexy technology and it was really marketed towards early adopters. But we both know early adopters more or less come to you. They're banging on your door to get the next thing. You don't have to sell to them. The marketing has now taken a turn. We have a new head of marketing in ProteinSimple. And we're now trying to leverage, first of all, R&D systems so the broad commercial reach we have with a network globally of researchers, that's very extensive. And I think it will pay off. The cross-selling -- if anything, it's gotten them to open up and be much more collaborative with the rest of the Company and it's working quite well. As you know, our head of sales on the biotech comes from the instrument space, a life-tech person and has been very instrumental in helping that team out there really also get back on track. But we're not only putting in process; we're also putting in systems that can give us evidence of how we're doing. And we will get it until we get it right. It's one of the largest work streams for a life science professional. It's, we think, well over a $2 billion market space. But it's a hard process to crack. You've got to sell it to a lot of people. It's a manual process and a lot of these labs have grad students anyway and it's kind of a Western blot is a bit of a rite of passage, I think, for a chemist. You've got to break through all that and we're going to have to do more demos and a lot of classical methodologies for selling instruments which we have a lot of people here that know how to do it. And it's all beginning to work. As we have been careful to say, we're not through it yet. It's on the way back and it's -- we're definitely well over halfway through this we think. Paul Knight : I know you had acquired the firm that was working on your Internet marketing capability on the reagent portfolio, your Denver-based asset. Could you provide us an update on where you are in the progress with their offering lineup and the development of that business? Chuck Kummeth : I'll have to give you a dollar the next time I see you because it's a really good story. The website is fantastic. We launched it last summer on schedule, on budget. I've rarely been able to do that in my career with a website. That team is unbelievable. And if you have taken a look at our new website, it is dramatically improved from what the deal website was. And we're talking about links to tens of thousands of products, links to citations, links to data. The Pathways section is unbelievable. So it's a dramatically improved user experience and our traffic is going up. And on the retail side of our business, obviously more traffic. More time on the Web means more sales and it's happening. The Novus numbers are moving up more quickly than the rest of the portfolio. Because of this, because it is -- they were already known in that space and that website was the first -- that business first to use the new website, we're in high single-digit growth safely. And I shouldn't comment further, but I think the future is even upside. So, especially here. Paul Knight : And then last, Chuck, on the reagent portfolio, you are trying to add to the simple protein product line -- the catalog you are trying to build on reagents for the Western blot. How are we there? Chuck Kummeth : It's continuing to grow, well over 1,100 certified antibodies. We continue to build momentum as awareness is out there. Wow, we can buy antibodies that that actually will be proven to work with the system, so we don't have to waste half of what we bought trying to dial them in. That's what we hear a lot. The comments that Jim talked about with the consumables being up 20%, even though we were down in the category, it tells you something that the consumables and the content are growing and that people are using the machines that are out there. So we like that a lot. The whole model in China is going quite well. This is a record quarter for us. We've never had 30% growth for China. So I think that's going to bode well for the overall business as well. So it's coming together. People ask me all the time, how many is enough. Do we need 3,000 or 5000 certified antibodies? I think it's more important that we zone in on the antibodies that are of interest in the applied markets. And it's probably -- we're probably getting close to really the majority of the distribution we have to have to really help the category. But we will keep doing it. It's the future. People want certified antibodies. They want antibodies that work. They want quality and they are tired of all the junk out there. And that is our strategy to provide quality. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And we have a question from Amanda Murphy from William Blair. Please go ahead. Amanda Murphy : Could you just talk a little bit about the three segments of the biologics business? So, thinking about proteins, antibodies and ELISA kits specifically. I think you talked in the past about having some price competition and maybe that has changed a bit over the past year or so. So just looking for an update on how those two businesses are doing specifically. Chuck Kummeth : You mean in biotech. Okay. Amanda Murphy : I'm sorry. Biotech. Chuck Kummeth : They are all roughly in the same range in size. We don't give specifics, but they are not too far off. They are all important. The protein business was where we're the worldwide leader by far. It is certainly the smallest market and it's not growing north of 3% to 4%, we feel. We're working ahead of market right now. And I think our strategy of going upstream, providing even more quality, doing -- continue to do the hard-to-do, only-offered-by-us proteins is kind of our strategy. We have PrimeGene for -- and Novus for fighter brands, so to speak and for China. For China -- and I can tell you the cytokine and the protein business -- China is growing north of 40%. So it's extremely healthy. And the PrimeGene strategy is working; we have a brand-new factory there. It's all G&P approved and we love what we see. The biggest pond to go after here includes antibodies. And we bought Novus. It's many billions. It depends a lot by the applied markets you are in. We have 7% growth in that space which is about at market. I think market, depending what you want to believe, is somewhere -- you read between 6% and 8%. So we're in the range. I think a lot of that has to do with this is what we're seeing really help with our website. We also introduced just a minor new portfolio last year, 8,000 new products of sample antibodies. And these are $99 apiece. This is something we've never done before, coming down at lower packet sizes to reach the retail segment. You always had to buy a lot of Verity Systems' branded stuff to get anything. And clearly our competition was being much more flexible with customers. So we've done this and it's been a huge success. And then -- it's actually helped a lot. So since a lot of these people are buying a sample that weren't customers before and then they're understanding who we're and what we have to offer, then they are ordering up. So that's all helping as well. One assay side, I think that's the newest -- that's the biggest unknown frontier. I think with our Luminix association which is going very well, with strong growth, we also sell instruments there now, too. And we're selling in every region of the world. So, selling full solutions. We also sell content to a lot of people in this space. And we're the ELISA leader and, of course, that's why we bought CyVek. With the platform of CyVek, we have a next-generation microfluidic parallel ELISA system ready to go. And as of last week, we just launched a whole new cartridge, a 72 x 1 which is essentially a super ELISA. It's the only way to explain it 4 to 5 logs of dynamic range, extremely sensitive, extremely accurate and extremely fast. And a sample to data and answers in one hour. So we think we're on track for expanding our asset business. Again, this is a bigger -- much bigger market than the protein business and so all three segments are important. It's defend, expand and expand. Amanda Murphy : And on the pricing side, I know you have been looking at your book of business there from pricing perspective. Just curious what you're seeing, if any change. I think you've gotten a bit better from a competitive standpoint, if I recall correctly. Chuck Kummeth : It was one of my big worries coming into this Company was that are we going to be really worried about price going forward with a strong [indiscernible] of R&D systems brand. But we've not had any price impact. We have been able to increase prices on important new to the world, where we stand alone as the only premier reagent supplier. And, of course, we have to go to war in the low-end stuff and we have PrimeGene and other things to work with. The net of it all is our pricing is [Technical Difficulty] which I think is outstanding given the way these markets are. Amanda Murphy : Okay. And then on the biopharma side, obviously that's been quite strong. And you guys are a bit earlier in the process in terms of R&D. But is there any weakness potentially that you see just given the volatility that's in the market these days? Like I said -- go ahead, sorry. Chuck Kummeth : Give you a dollar, too. It's also a really good story, especially we've had three very good quarters in a row. A lot of discussion a couple of quarters ago about was Germany back. Germany's really getting -- Europe is hitting on all cylinders, really. It's really looking great. I think, all in all, there's nothing really to worry about along those lines for now. Amanda Murphy : Okay and then just last one. You talked about M&A a bit and ProteinSimple starting to turn around. So just from a timing perspective, are you -- do you feel comfortable with ProteinSimple at this point such that you could pursue something if it arose? Or do you still feel you need a bit more time? Chuck Kummeth : It's a great question. We've done 6 acquisitions since I've been here. I would say 5 are pretty much integrated. I would say ProteinSimple's pretty much integrated. And in terms of ProteinSimple being on track, it really is three segments in ProteinSimple and two are doing great. It's the Simple Western platform which is the biggest reason we bought it, of course. But that's the part that we're reengineering and it's on track. The biologics is a great story. And with the new Maurice platform being launched, we expect high growth to continue in that area. And are we ready for more? Absolutely. We've always been ready for more and we probably have never been more ready than now. We have spent a lot of time on this process and we have participated in some that were heartbreakers that got away, but it doesn't stop us. We were on a rigorous process. We were on process that we have targets in parallel and deals will come when deals come. And one thing we will not do, though, is overpay. We will remain very disciplined. And our process never allows us to fall in love with anything that we shouldn't be falling in love with too early. Operator : And our next question is going to come from Matthew Hewitt from Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : This is Dylan on for Matt. Two quick ones, could you guys quantify the OEM shipment that helped out the clinical controls in the quarter? Jim Hippel : We don't give data that specific. But they are large pharma-based customers, essentially. And they missed by just a few days last quarter. And are they material or do they carry this division with a strong tenet [Technical Difficulty] organic growth? Without them, we still would have had a good quarter. You got to look at this as a more annualized business now, with the two segments being much more lumpy with the long shelf life and the bulk ordering that they do. And all in all, things -- I think you'll find that they net out right where we see they should net out. Unidentified Analyst : And then I'll go fishing with this one as well. Do you guys have a long term target to return to double-digit top-line organic growth? And if so, when could we expect that? Chuck Kummeth : Double-digit organic growth in the Company this size already, I think it would be good. We've always stressed the core of the Company which is now still over half by far, but it's mid-single-digit growth. And with the markets growing the way they're growing and proteins being where they are with a large share, it's hard to get too over our skis on that. I think mid-single-digit growth is what we continue to say. Long term, we have our goals. We've given that. And the new spaces, yes, we want ProteinSimple. We want the Simple Western back in a 20% growth area. CyVek is never going to be as large a business -- the ELISA platform. But it's a solid new business. It's all organic growth. It's all growth because it's a start-up. The net-net of it all, we've always said, should be high single digits is where we think will be. And with PP -- with ProteinSimple back on track, we would be there. You can do your own math on our quarter and if you can do the math without ProteinSimple and what we would be at in [indiscernible]. And then do the math. If we'd been at plan with ProteinSimple, you can see the math and you can see we would be right where you're talking about. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Chuck Kummeth : Give it a couple more seconds. Okay. Well, thanks, everyone, for joining in. A good quarter for us and we're looking forward already in this quarter and we're busy at it. And we will look forward to talking to you again very soon. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thanks for joining. This complete your conference call. You may all disconnect and have a great day.",

And with that, I will turn the call over to Chuck. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter conference call. This morning, we reported revenue growth of 15% for the third quarter with the majority of our end markets remaining strong organically, plus a solid contribution from our recent acquisition. I'm extremely pleased with the achievement of 8% organic growth corporate-wide, with our core Biotech business growing 6% organically. In fact, this is Bio-Techne's strongest quarter since I joined the company three years ago, providing evidence that the strategy to reaccelerate Bio-Techne's top line by growing our core business and expanding to adjacent markets continues to gain traction. Protein Platforms increased over 25% organically in the quarter with our commercial reorganization and focused strategy beginning to yield results. I'm also very pleased with our team's operational performance in the quarter with both growth and operating margins exceeding our internal plan, driving operating margins once again above 40%, and contributing to a 14% year-over-year increase in our adjusted net income. In our Biotechnology business, overall, we experienced broad-based growth across the portfolio with proteins, antibodies and assays all contributing to solid performance. I would like to highlight the performance of our antibody portfolio in the quarter, which grew high single-digits overall, including a 20% increase in our Novus Biologicals brand. In the U.S., our biopharma end markets remain strong with revenue increasing mid-teens for the quarter. Our biopharma customers continue to partner with Bio-Techne for the outsourcing of complex molecules with our reputation for ultra-pure, highly bio-reactive reagents driving additional business within our existing biopharma client base and creating opportunities with new customers. Our academia and government end market grew in the low single-digits, similar to the trend we've experienced in recent quarters. We've been experiencing growth in this end market since the major update of our website last summer. We will continue to invest in the ongoing evolution of our website by making navigation improvements, and adding content and active links to thousands of products that resonate with our academia customers. Since the release of our updated website, internal Internet traffic has continued to increase, and encouragingly, the visitors to our site are spending more time on the site, increasing the probability of ordering. We are also investing in search engine optimization to drive traffic to our website. These investments are starting to pay off with our Novus Biologicals brand, which was the first of our brands to use the enhanced website. Seeing an upper-single-digit increase in website visits and a mid-teen increase in web-generated revenue, overall, we are making tremendous progress with our website redesign and view this as a key for long-term growth within our academic customer base. Moving on to other regions, Europe organic growth was flat overall in Q3. However, underlying trends within our European Biotech business remain healthy. Adjusting for the timing of the Easter holiday, which occurred in Q3 this year versus Q4 last year, as well as the timing of some large biopharma orders, normalized growth rates would have been a mid-single digit increase. Thus, as these timing issues reverse in Q4, we expect to end fiscal year 2016 with a solid mid-single-digit organic growth rate for the year. China remains a very strong geography for Bio-Techne with organic revenue increasing in the mid-20%s year over year. We are particularly impressed with the sustained growth in China, especially considering the 30% increase we experienced in this geography last quarter. Our new GMP factory for PrimeGene is complete and fully functional, giving Bio-Techne the competitive edge in our China for China strategy and supporting our expectations for continued strong double-digit growth in this geography. We anticipate the growing Chinese middle class will be driving ongoing demand for improved access to healthcare, driving additional investments in life science research and benefiting our rapidly growing business in this geography. Overall, we are very pleased with the strong performance within our core Biotech product portfolio with Q3 representing the fourth consecutive quarter of at least mid-single digit organic growth in the segment. Getting our core back to consistent mid-single digit growth has been the most challenging and complex part of our five-year strategic plan, and I'm proud of our team's effort to get us there and have confidence in their ability to maintain this momentum. Moving on to our Clinical Controls division, we experienced a strong performance from our acquired business, Cliniqa, although the timing of OEM delivery dates impacted organic growth in the quarter. As a reminder, our Bionostics and Cliniqa businesses both include chemistry-based reagent product lines with longer shelf lives, allowing OEM customers to buy in bulk, introducing the potential for quarter-to-quarter volatility. Our legacy hematology controls business remains stable, growing mid-single-digits. Given the relatively shorter shelf life of our hematology control products, we view growth of these products as an indicator of stable underlying demand within our Clinical Controls end market. Cliniqa, a controls and reagent supplier for diagnostic market that we acquired last July, continues to outperform our expectations. Importantly, the addition of Cliniqa to the Bio-Techne Clinical Controls division continues to open up additional pipeline opportunities for the business, making Bio-Techne an even more important supplier to the biopharma and diagnostics industries. Cliniqa under the Bio-Techne umbrella, we are now focused on filling and expanding the growing pipeline of opportunities for our Clinical Controls division. I would like to point out that the growth of our organic business combined with Cliniqa has created a business with critical mass and annualized revenue run rate approaching $100 million. Lastly, the work we have done over the last couple of quarters to improve our Protein Platforms sales force and commercialization strategy is beginning to bear fruit of organic growth above 25% for the quarter. I want to update everyone on some of the positive developments within our Protein Platforms segment that give us confidence in our ability to maintain double-digit growth in this business exiting fiscal 2016 and beyond. Our strength in Simple Western sales force has been in place for two quarters now, and given the six-month to nine-month instrumentation selling cycle, I believe we are in the early innings of realizing the efforts of our strengthened commercial team. Additionally, we continue to augment the Simple Western sales force with the entire R&D Systems commercial team to generate leads, cross-sell and demo this game-changing western blot technology. This game-changing technology continues to resonate with the scientific community, and we anticipate significant western blot share capture by automating a time-consuming, manual and poorly reproducible process that has been in place for over 35 years. We remain very pleased with the performance of Simple Plex product line within the Protein Platforms segment this quarter. As a reminder, this is the rebranded CyVek startup business we acquired a year ago in November, consisting of the Ella line of multiplex ELISA instruments and associated assay cartridges. We continue to see growing interest from our customers for the workflow enhancements that Simple Plex testing platform delivers. We remain in the very early stages of Ella instrument adoption and the associated revenue ramp, and anticipate Simple Plex to become a significant revenue contributor in future quarters. During the quarter, we strengthened our Protein Platforms offering with the launch of Maurice, an advanced imaging capillary electrophoresis, or iCE, instrument. All pharmaceutical customers utilize iCE instruments for the quantitative analysis of identity, purity and heterogeneity. Maurice improves our legacy iCE platforms by delivering higher sensitivity, easier workflow and shorter run times compared to legacy technologies, allowing researchers to shorten drug development timelines. We are very pleased of the early traction Maurice is gaining with biopharmaceutical customers with the initial launch exceeding our expectations. We anticipate Maurice to be a solid addition to the growing lineup of Protein Platforms instruments. We further strengthened our Protein Platforms segment through the acquisition of Zephyrus Biosciences, adding a single-cell western blot instrument we named Milo to our growing portfolio of instruments. Zephyrus is currently a pre-revenue business, although we plan to commercialize Milo in July of 2016. We view Zephyrus's single-cell western blot technology as a natural fit with our ProteinSimple business and are excited to leverage our Protein Platforms sales force to bring another innovative instrument to market. To summarize, we are very pleased with the Protein Platforms' overall performance in Q3 and believe we remain on track for continued momentum in this business in coming quarters. Based on the sales pipeline and positive momentum in both lead generation and quote activity, we believe Q1 was the start of a new long-term trend of double-digit growth for the Protein Platforms segment. I also want to provide a quick update on our M&A pipeline. Following the Zephyrus acquisition, our pipeline of potential M&A targets remained stronger than ever with our strong balance sheet and cash flow providing Bio-Techne flexibility in our disciplined M&A approach. We plan to continue to augment our organic business with acquisitions that strengthen our position in existing businesses and geographies, or leverage our reagent expertise in adjacent markets. With that, I'll pass the call over to Jim for a more detailed review of the financials before we open the line up for Q&A. Jim? James T. Hippel - Bio-Techne Corp.: Yeah. Thank you, Chuck. As in our prior earnings call, I will provide an overview of our Q3 financial performance for the total company and then provide some color on each of our three segments. Starting with the overall third quarter financial performance, adjusted earnings increased 14% year-over-year to $37.6 million, while adjusted EPS was $1.01 a share versus $0.88 in the prior year. The impact of currency translation represented a headwind to EPS of approximately $0.02. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.81 compared to $0.65 in the prior year. Q3 reported revenue was $131 million, an increase of 15% year-over-year, with organic revenue increasing 8%. Third quarter reported sales included 7% growth contribution from acquisitions, partially offset by a 1% unfavorable foreign exchange headwind. Please note that the components of Q3 growth do not sum due to rounding. Moving on to the details of the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin was 71.6% in Q3, decreasing 80 basis points from the prior year. Strong volume leverage and productivity gains in our Protein Platforms and Biotech divisions were more than offset by the lower margin Cliniqa acquisition and unfavorable FX impact. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and FX, core gross margins improved 50 basis points year-over-year in the third quarter. Adjusted SG&A in Q3 was 20.7% of revenue, 30 basis points higher than last year. The SG&A increase was driven primarily by investments made to improve our website capabilities and commercial execution, as well as the additional SG&A from the acquisitions made since the beginning of the third quarter of last year. R&D expense in Q3 was 8.6% of revenue, 90 basis points lower than last year, reflecting the volume leverage achieved from Protein Platforms. The resulting adjusted operating margin for Q3 was 42.4%, relatively flat to prior year and a sequential improvement of 300 basis points from Q2. Looking at our numbers below operating income, net interest expense in Q3 was $0.4 million compared to $0.3 million of net interest expense last year due to higher draws on our line of credit, which partially funded our Cliniqa acquisition last July. Other non-operating expense for the quarter was $0.7 million compared to $0.4 million of non-operating expense in the prior year quarter with unfavorable transactional FX explaining the year-over-year variance. Our adjusted effective tax rate in Q3 was 31%, down 50 basis points from the third quarter of last year due to recognition of R&D tax credits. In terms of returning capital, we continue to pay our dividend and paid out $11.9 million in the quarter. Average diluted shares were relatively flat over the year ago at 37.3 million shares outstanding. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, $37.1 million of cash was generated from operations in the third quarter, a 20% increase from the prior year, and our investment in capital expenditures was $2.8 million. We ended the quarter with $84.6 million of cash and short-term available for sale investments. Our long-term debt obligations at the end of Q3 stood at $157.8 million, a decrease of $5.5 million from end of Q2. Going forward, our capital deployment priorities remain opportunistic M&A, our dividend and debt pay down. Now, I'll discuss the performance of our three business segments, starting with the Biotechnology segment. Q3 reported sales were $81.4 million, with organic growth of 6%. Foreign exchange negatively impacted reported sales growth by approximately 2%. By geography, the U.S. grew approximately 10% organically with mid-teens biopharma sales growth and low single-digit academic results. Europe was flat organically with biopharma sales in this region increasing low single-digits, offsetting a low single-digit decline in academia. As Chuck mentioned in his comments, the timing of the Easter holiday impacted our European results, representing an unfavorable 3% impact to our growth in this geography. However, this timing impact should reverse in Q4. China experienced strong organic growth in the mid-20s%, while Pacific Rim declined upper single-digits year-over-year. Excluding Japan, however, the Pacific Rim grew in the low teens. Japan remains challenged by government funding reductions and delays. Adjusted operating income for the Biotech segment increased 1% in Q3 compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 55.5%, a decrease of 130 basis points year-over-year due to the timing of certain commercial investments, partially offset by the impact of productivity initiatives and volume leverage. Turning now to Clinical Controls, segment sales in Q3 were $29.9 million, with reported growth of 50% over last year. The acquisition of Cliniqa contributed 51% to growth, while organic revenue decreased 1%. As with prior quarters, the timing of OEM shipment orders introduces variability to Clinical Controls segment, with customer ordering patterns weighing on our Q3 segment results. Given the quarterly variability introduced by the OEM ordering patterns from our chemistry-based controls and now Cliniqa, we believe a trailing 12-month organic rate is more indicative of our Clinical Controls segment performance. On a pro forma basis, assuming Cliniqa was included in our results last year, as well as this year, the trailing 12-month organic growth rate for the segment is 8%. Clinical Controls' adjusted operating income increased 53% in Q3; and adjusted operating margin was 31.6%, an increase of 70 basis points from the prior year. The higher adjusted operating income and margin was primarily attributable to strong volume leverage associated with the Cliniqa acquisition. Moving on to our Protein Platforms segment, net sales in Q3 were $19.7 million, an organic increase of 26% from the prior year period. Unfavorable currency translation impacted revenues by less than 1%. Growth in the segment was broad-based with most major regions and product lines growing by solid double-digits. Quarter ended March 2016 was the first March end quarter to grow sequentially from the previous December end quarter in the history of ProteinSimple, including the years predating the acquisition of Bio-Techne. We believe this provides further evidence that our new commercial strategy is taking hold, and the reacceleration of Protein Platforms have begun. Revenue from Simple Plex also continues to ramp, and we remain pleased with the revenue trajectory of this business. As Chuck discussed, we acquired Zephyrus Biosciences in Q3, and anticipate to commercialize the associated single-cell western blot analysis instrument, Milo, during the first quarter of our fiscal 2017. Adjusted operating income in Q3 for the Protein Platforms segment was $1.6 million, representing an operating margin of 8.1% compared to a $1.7 million adjusted operating loss one year ago, with strong volume leverage and productivity driving the year-over-year improvement. We continue to expect additional improvement in Protein Platforms' profitability as top-line growth and productivity gains drive operating leverage in coming quarters. So in summary, Q3 was a record quarter for Bio-Techne on an adjusted bottom-line result, accomplished by solid commercial and operational execution in all of our businesses. We expect to finish the year strong as well, with Q4 looking very similar to Q3 from a top-line perspective. However, we expect the mix to change somewhat with the Biotechnology segment, in particular, facing a rather tough comp from prior year when they grew 7% organically. Thus, the margin profile in Q4 may not be as strong as Q3 due to a change in mix. That concludes my prepared comments and with that, I will turn the call back over to Melanie to open the lines for some questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll go first to Dan Leonard with Leerink Partners. Dan L. Leonard - Leerink Partners LLC : Thank you. So I just want to delve into the Protein Platforms performance a bit more. Can you talk more about the components of the growth there? I know you said it was broad-based, so maybe offer some color about how much of the strength was Maurice versus Simple Western, and any color on the consumable trends as opposed to the instrument revenue trends, would be helpful. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Yeah, well, Maurice has a strong take-up here as the beginning platform, but it's still not material to the overall performance. Performance of the division really is still around Simple Western. We worked hard to get the commercial team really back into place and up to speed, and focusing on lead generations and productivity and cross selling with our R&D Systems commercial force, and that's all bearing fruit. We really thought \u2013 we're near the 60 kind of number of instruments per quarter, and that's up from the 40s or so a year ago. So, it's pretty good growth there overall. The Simple Plex is also ramping and is close to plan. Still a small business, but not a startup anymore. It's starting to bear fruit. The revenue component in Simple Plex will be stronger in consumables, the assays being a strong component because it's a closed system. We remain at about a 25% consumable rate on the rest of the biologics platform. So, really, growth is really kind of across all the platforms, with the biggest component being Simple Western. Biologics has always been a strong platform, and even the existing product platforms are still selling well and Maurice is a new category, so almost the same size in general as Simple Western, but the acceleration of Simple Western outpaces biologics, of course. We could have a surprise going forward. Maurice is exceeding our expectations, but we are still banking on the fact that Simple Western will outdo it. It's a much larger market opportunity. Dan L. Leonard - Leerink Partners LLC : Got it. That's all helpful. And then my follow-up question, can you give us an update on how you're looking at Japan? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Well, the same way everybody else is, with a lot of prayers. So, they're \u2013 we've been hearing that they're aimed at new consortium of funding pharma. The government is starting to release funds. We're starting to see early, I guess, data from that. It's as much an issue of easy comps as anything, probably, but it's still early. I just \u2013 we don't \u2013 we're not banking on any strong, fast recovery in Japan, to be honest, and I don't think anyone else is talking about it either. I don't think we're worse off than anybody else, it's just a matter of waiting on funding. We're still growing. Actually, our team just came back from Protein Platforms division and they had a positive report on some uptake in Japan. But in general, it's kind of steady as she goes and just not enough happening, waiting on funding. Dan L. Leonard - Leerink Partners LLC : Got it. Thanks, Chuck. Operator : We'll go next to Jeff Elliott with Robert Baird. Jeff T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks for the question. Jim, can you just verify, did you have any change in selling days in the quarter? I get the Easter impact, but were you kind of same year-over-year in terms of the number of days in the quarter. James T. Hippel - Bio-Techne Corp.: Yeah. We didn't have any drastic change due to any kind of 4-4-5 calendar because we operate on a normalized typical calendar. However, admittedly, there was an extra day with leap year. So leap year was the extra day in February, did provide an extra day of revenue there. It may have had a 1% or so lift. It's hard to say exactly. Jeff T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. So pretty minor, though. And just, moving over to \u2013 I guess, sticking with Jim, I guess, looking at the segment margins, given the moving pieces with Cliniqa and some of the, I guess, deals, I guess, can you just help us think about the segment margins maybe in the next couple of quarters? How should we think about modeling those? James T. Hippel - Bio-Techne Corp.: Yeah. From a segment margin perspective, I would say that with regards to our Biotech and Clinical Controls divisions, fairly steady margins from what we've seen. It's more around Protein Platforms that we can continue to see some expansion there with the margin pull-through \u2013 with the net revenue pull-through. So like we saw from not only year-over-year, but quarter-over-quarter perspective with Protein Platforms, we saw some nice \u2013 very nice margin expansion there with the additional revenue. And as they continue to recover on the top line, we should see some continued leverage on their cost base. So I'd say steady \u2013 Chuck put it as steady as she goes in two of our three segments with some increasing margin pull-through in Protein Platforms. But also, keep in mind, the overall mix, with that reacceleration of Protein Platforms' revenue, the overall mix will be a bit of a headwind due to the low margin overall of PPD versus our Biotech division. Jeff T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: When you start doing the math, when you start doing your math on CCD, you're going to see the strong component tradition here from Cliniqa. We had a huge quarter for them. It didn't count organically, but it's there in the numbers and it's big. It is a lumpier business and we're going to go to a TTM kind of number. It won't sustain at that run rate this quarter. It's going to be up and down just to realize that. That would be \u2013 you're going to \u2013 $29.9 million is not a typical quarter for this segment. Jeff T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Got it. Okay. Thanks, guys. That's helpful. Nice quarter. Operator : And we'll go next to Amanda Murphy with William Blair. Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. Just a couple of quick ones. So, first, I don't think you mentioned the Fisher distribution agreement specifically, I guess how that's gone this quarter. I know it's kind of been a little bit back and forth in terms of how much contribution it's had, so wondering if it was helpful and how you're thinking about it long term. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Well, we're still low single-digits in academia, which is still way better than it used to be. I think it's kind of steady as she goes there. I would say the Fisher performance as a component of that was marginally better than last quarter; still not as good as it was in the first early quarters in our relationship. Now, we are starting to hit some size issues here. It's becoming a larger and larger percentage share of our channel in the academia sector. I think if you compare it to their results overall, and we study their results and we talk to them, I'd say we came in under where they were at in their own performance. So, we're working through that. All-in-all, though, better than last quarter, so we're optimistic. And it is still a crucial element to our channel strategy and helping us keep our costs down in our commercial organization, and the attitude is good, cross-selling is good, teams get along. So, we're hanging in there with that. And it would be nice to see them break it out and do at least as well as they talk about their entire segment as a company at Thermo, but we have not yet achieved that. Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC: Is there any specific driver of that slowdown or is it just a function of kind of being early in the relationship and working through, and as you said, just similar size? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: No, it's not only that. I think we had some great preliminary results for five quarters, six quarters in a row, really. And I think what changed was a couple \u2013 the dynamics within their own company as they integrated life tech. One, you've added a lot of the portfolio. They've got a much bigger bag to sell, and it opened up opportunities internally, I think, for a lot of their rock star salespeople and their technical people. So, they've had more internal turnovers. So, people are jumping from the Fisher side to the Thermo Fisher division. And so we're having to train and retrain and get a more \u2013 more of a rhythm going with their sales force. I think as a bigger issue, it's how much is in the bag and staying current with their technical workforce. Our portfolio is \u2013 it doesn't sell itself. It's very complicated technical reagents, and we trained their entire technical sales force from the beginning and we've got to keep the pace with that. And I think that's probably why it's been a little bit different the last couple of quarters, but it's coming back. We've identified the issues there, and they are very supportive and we're working on that, so... Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: It is a big company and it's firing in all cylinders, as you saw their report, so they've got lots of opportunities for people and people are moving around. Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC: Makes sense. And then just one, I guess, broader question. I think in the past, you've said that based on your current book of business, that you could see a revenue run rate closer to $750 million if you include potential synergies that you might be able to drive. And so, I guess, my question is, is that still the case? And then secondly, you talked about the pipeline that you have being fairly strong. And when you first came on board, you outlined a plan of inorganic and organic growth. So, given what you have in the pipeline, do you still see that, those targets as being achievable? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Yeah. So, our strat plan is trying to get to $1 billion in five years. I think we're still within the range of that possibility. It wasn't \u2013 it's always been more of an ideal. It's not a forecast or anything, of course. I think we backed off to $750 million number a little over a year ago when FX kind of went crazy on us here, Europe especially, really talking more of a steady state around $650 million or so if we did no other deals, and then getting up into the low 40%s, the margin area. I think we are on track for that. There's no issue, but we are going to do deals. Our pipeline remains very strong. We've been in some actions we haven't \u2013 one as of late, we spent a lot of time on the Affymetrix deal. We really wanted that. Clearly, we were outbid by a heavyweight that wanted it badly and had a lot more synergies than we could offer. But we're always working on many at the same time and we currently are as well. They are probably leaning a little more toward the private side, and we'll try to do a few things without attracting the big guys, but there's a lot of opportunities. We have strong cash flow. We've got a great team. We've got \u2013 we're working together on some deals where the teams do get along, so it's just about making the numbers work and making investors happy and all that stuff. But our pipeline remains on the order of 100 different targets from small to large, so... Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Matt Hewitt with Craig-Hallum Capital Group. Matt G. Hewitt - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC : Good morning. Congratulations on the strong quarter. A couple of questions from me. First, so if I'm understanding, in the Clinical Controls segment, you had some benefit with timing on shipments in the third quarter. Just trying to calibrate what that means for Q4. Is it \u2013 are you expecting something similar to Q2 at $25 million, $26 million or something similar to the year ago period with maybe a few basis points of growth so that would be closer to $21 million? James T. Hippel - Bio-Techne Corp.: Yeah, Matt, well \u2013 we're not going to give a specific guidance by segment. I think what I would share with you is that it is lumpy and it's \u2013 so, in fact, we had strong orders out of Cliniqa, which doesn't count organically, but I mean, out of our legacy chemistry-based controls business, which, in fact, is organic. And going forward, it could be lumpy as well. But again, at a high level, what we will share is that we expect our overall company revenues to be similar in Q3 \u2013 or Q4 and Q3. The mix between the business units could change a little bit. I think it will change somewhat in the sense that PPD overall revenue will be likely a lower percentage that's a negative mix impact. That's what we'll share. Matt G. Hewitt - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC : Okay. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: And we will also \u2013 hematology component has been and have been, and remains and will remain steady as she goes at 5%-ish growth rates, very much a run rate... Matt G. Hewitt - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC : Okay. All right. Thanks. And then, Chuck, maybe a question for you. When you came on board, there was a lot of heavy lifting on the investment side, there was a lot of internal investments that need to be made. Where do you think you are in that stage? What stage do you think you are in those heavy investments? Do you see that tailing off? Obviously, investing for growth will be necessary, but from some of those initial investments, where do we sit and how does that play out over the next year or two years? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: That's a great question. I think \u2013 I'd say we're about in the seventh inning on that. The investments kind of come in two categories for me. One is they're really operational and they're really needed for productivity or they're capital, right? And we have built out three different buildings already here on my watch, and at the most, we have one more to do here, internally here and locally in headquarters that we're playing around with in terms of ability to kind of rework our total work streams. I mean, you've been here, right? This place is like a honeycomb. It's like \u2013 changing around and making improvements is like working a Rubik's cube. So, you need to start with a big enough blank sheet of paper or space to try and redo everything and clean it up. So, we're in the middle of that. We're doing a lot of lean things. As you saw, our margins improved again. We had absolutely phenomenal productivity again in this \u2013 in the Biotech sector. But software around email, computers all being replaced, LMS system, and we're ready to pull the trigger on phase one of our ERP system in July. That's all on track, which is fairly expensive. We've got a lot of \u2013 and the team, the executive team is pretty much in place. I don't see a lot of new additions going forward. The stock and equity-based compensation is all in place for the top 100 people. There's not a big need to further do that right now, unless there's need through acquisitions of new team members that way. So I think we're in a good place there. We have capital needs going forward, I think, with the phase two and three of ERP. There's continued investment, I'd say a steady-state on the website development, nothing more, but nothing less. We've made improvements there. So that will be a same as she goes going forward. We are putting in place another \u2013 putting in place Hyperion for consolidation. We've gone from 6 sites to 21 sites, and poor Jim is tired of consolidating the spreadsheets on napkins, so we're getting a \u2013 the real system he's used to using from his days at Thermo and most of the world uses, and things like that you have to do. But really the \u2013 you said it well. The heavy lifting, I think, is really behind us. We're going through a \u2013 our \u2013 my third round of roundtables. I've probably done over 30 different meetings with groups of employees on the last three months, four months, and they're noticing it. They're very appreciative and they get it. They see where we're going and they see it. Matt G. Hewitt - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC : That's \u2013 go ahead. That's great. Thank you very much. That's a really good update. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to William March with Janney Montgomery Scott. William March - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Hey, guys, it's Bill March on for Paul Knight. How are you guys doing? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Good. James T. Hippel - Bio-Techne Corp.: Good. William March - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : First question, maybe if you could \u2013 you saw mid-double digit growth in the biopharma segment, what's driving the growth from that end market? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Okay. Well, a couple of things. When we worked hard at getting our core back in place, I mean, we certainly took some arrows over ProteinSimple a few quarters ago. But the harder part of this company turning around and getting it going has been getting this core because it is just so fragmented, as you know. We still don't have really any reagent products over 2 million, and we still have customer base is 1% or less in general. We typically have done a lot of prioritization since I've come here around what we're going to make and why, instead of just throwing 2,000 or more new products at the wall and see what sticks every year. We're substantially down from that now, somewhere around 1,500, but a lot quicker time to revenue. A lot more focus on the marking end of it and why there is going to be quick take-up. And part of that has been the trend, I think, in CRO. There's been a lot of custom in the industry and Abcam reported, won a lot of custom going on as well. We're seeing it, too. So we're getting on the Biotech pharma side. We're getting a lot of requests because we're a quality producer, we've got great scientists and we were, in some cases, the only game in town for the things we make. And they're coming more and more for special things. We try to put as much of that into the catalogue as possible. It doesn't all go. If it doesn't go, it's always still a recurring revenue stream with that partner. And the thing I like, it's immediate sales. You're not waiting at all. So we've had a dramatic improvement in our vitality index. If you remember though, our first year here, we reported about $2.4 million in first year sales. Last year, we reported $5.8 million. This year, we're probably well over $10 million, we're thinking. So it's been a dramatic improvement in the core, but also from custom and everything else, and it's largely Biotech pharma, which has been driving this double digit growth rate when you start adding the numbers up. William March - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Great. And then... Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: And what's interesting, much more visible, too, are the websites helping there. We're \u2013 I could go on and on about our tradeshow strategies and investments there, the booth redesigns, the comprehensive look we have around our family of brands. We just came back from ACR and the response was unbelievable. We had a record number of leads and pretty much across the board, customers are saying, yeah, we know who Bio-Techne is now and we're \u2013 and we like doing business with you. We like the path you are on with all the different segments because you're becoming more and more of a one-stop shop for us, so. William March - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Great. And then secondly, in terms of end markets, maybe on the academic side, what are you seeing from that end market in terms of with the new NIH budget and maybe what you see for the rest of the calendar year? Thanks. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Yeah, we're seeing kind of what everyone else is reporting on. I don't think we've seen too much of a take-up yet from that extra funding and spending. Maybe a little bit, but we're not really seeing a lot of evidence. We're \u2013 like everyone thinks, it's going to be really occurring mostly in the second half of the calendar year here. And we're hopeful. It should be \u2013 we've talked about what it should give us. When you roll it all through, when you go through our analytics with our customers, it should be about a 1% overall improvement for us. Is it there yet or not? Well, we had a record quarter, maybe a little bit there. It's hard to start separating the stuff under 1% like that, so... William March - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Understood. Thanks, guys. Have a good day. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: At least we're moving in the right direction. At least we're not contracting. We're going to \u2013 we're in an expansion timeframe for a while, we think. So that's good. William March - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : And that will conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Well, very proud of our team. It was a great quarter. I'm sure hope it continues. We see a lot of \u2013 we see a very bright future here. People are having fun, and we'll talk to you again next quarter. Thank you. Operator : That does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants have been placed in listen-only mode and the call will be open for questions following management\u2019s prepared remarks. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jim Hippel, Bio-Techne\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead. Jim Hippel : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me this morning is Chuck Kummeth, Chief Executive Officer of Bio-Techne. Before we begin, let me briefly cover our Safe Harbor statement. Some of the comments made during this conference call may be considered forward-looking statements, including beliefs and expectations about the Company\u2019s future results. The Company\u2019s 10-K for fiscal year 2015 identifies certain factors that could cause the Company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements made during this call. The Company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of any new information, or future events or developments. The 10-K, as well as the Company\u2019s other SEC filings, are available on the Company\u2019s website within its Investor Relations section. During the call, non-GAAP financial measures may be used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. Tables reconciling these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available in the Company\u2019s press release issued early this morning on the Bio-Techne website at www.bio-techne.com. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Chuck. Chuck Kummeth : Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter conference call. As you saw in our press release this morning, we ended the year on a strong note, and I\u2019m very pleased with our fourth quarter results, as well as the execution of our strategic plan all year. The Company delivered 10% organic growth in the quarter and achieved 6% growth organically for all of fiscal year 2016. This is a nice improvement over the 4% organic growth we had last year. In each of the past three years, we have improved organic growth each year. The biotech division had a great year, with 6% organic growth. And nice momentum at the finish, with 8% organic growth in Q4. Margins remained strong in the low-50s, due to leverage and scale and a strong year for productivity programs, which largely paid for our investments to drive growth. Europe had a solid year with mid-single-digit organic growth. The only issues we had with Europe happened in the final week, currency due to Brexit. Germany continues with a strong market, especially our biopharma customers. The UK finished the year with 6% growth and we see no changes to any of this momentum in the near-term. Our team has now expanded under new European leadership, and we have full subsidiaries in the UK, Germany, Scandinavia, Switzerland, and Italy, with good local distributors forming in the Middle East, Spain, and Eastern Europe. Europe now represents 22% of the total Company\u2019s revenues and nearly 30% of the biotech division. In the APAC region, we have had double-digit growth for three years in a row, with China again leading the way with 20% organic growth in fiscal 2016. Also, unfortunately, once again, Japan had a poor year due to research funding being delayed due to government bureaucracy. With the addition of strong new leadership in our APAC region, we have made further investments into building our businesses in countries outside of Japan and China. We now have great partners in Korea, Australia, India, and Singapore. Our headcount and critical mass continues to increase with this region now representing 4% of global sales in the biotech division. Back in the U.S., where we achieved high-single-digit growth for the year in the biotech division, we believe the biggest contributor to growth has been our new website. Last time we launched a complete overhaul of our main R&D Systems website, complete with 30-plus active pathways that are interactive with researchers to allow them to select the reagents they are looking for to advance their science. Thousands of products can be selected on our website. Search engine optimization, known as SEO, is also greatly improved, as is the speed to order. We have double-digit increases in traffic and purchases. This key difference, combined with our partnership with Fisher, has allowed us to return to solid growth in the academic sector of the market. Our pharma and biotech business remains strong, largely driven by the [indiscernible]. Another large contributor to growth is new product vitality. Last year, I spoke about our increased vitality in the biotech division with the first year of sales nearing $6 million. This year, we exceeded this number dramatically and topped $12 million in sales of products sold in the first year. This is just our reagents; and does not include our instruments, which adds significant overall number. This is an improvement of 500% three years ago. Innovation is the lifeblood of the science Company and we strive to deliver to our goals of 10% vitality to 100%. Speaking of instruments, protein platform division had a good year with 14% organic growth. We spent the first half of the fiscal year redesigning the marketing and commercial approach for the business. As a result of these changes, ProteinSimple experienced 25% plus organic growth in the two final quarters of the fiscal year. We still feel strongly that this business will become a $200 million business built on three important platforms : First Simple, biologics and the SimplePlex [indiscernible] platform. All three are seeing double-digit growth as they are becoming more widely accepted as novel new methods within their respective markets. Lastly, the clinical controls division achieved over $100 million in revenue in fiscal 2016. Margins remained strong at around 30%, and the integration of four businesses into a cohesive division that can leverage each other with OEM customers is working. Cliniqa, our latest acquisition in this division, had an incredible year with double-digit growth. This division makes us number one in this market and we have solutions for virtually every instrument in this space. Our next expansion in this division is in core diagnostics applications and will be leveraged with our leading content portfolio. Following the acquisition of Cliniqa, the integration of our BiosPacific business into this segment in early 2016, diagnostic immunoassays as well as bulk and customer agents for the diagnostics industry have become an increasingly more important revenue stream in this segment. Thus beginning in fiscal year 2017, our clinical controls segment will be referred to as the diagnostics division. Given the broader focus on diagnostics products other than controls and calibrators, we believe diagnostics division more accurately captures the future direction of this segment. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, fiscal year 2016 was a strong year in executing our strategic plan and our best year in three for growth especially organic growth. With nearly $500 million in revenue puts us halfway to our strategic target of 1 billion. It will take a combination of more acquisitions as well as strong organic growth to reach this goal, but we do see a vision on how to get there. The team has never been more energized and our results this year have invigorated the entire Company. As in the past three years, much of our strategic plan is based on acquisitions and we did complete Zephyrus in March, Advanced Cell Diagnostics, or ACD, in August. Both are strong additions to the portfolio. Zephyrus is an instrument Company, which has just launched a new platform, branded as Milo that performs single-cell western blot. It is based on a single-cell electrophoresis process, so it fits perfectly into the ProteinSimple line of instruments. Our latest acquisition, which closed just a couple of weeks ago was ACD. ACD marks Bio-Techne\u2019s entry into the genomics field and market. Second, and more importantly, its innovative and versatile technology has potential to change pathology practices. RNA-ISH is a transformative technology facilitating and improving the monitoring of gene expression patterns at the single-cell level, while retaining the morphological context of the tissue being analyzed. ACD\u2019s technology serves both research and diagnostic markets expanding Bio-Techne\u2019s presence in clinical lab settings. These last two acquisitions take our total to nine in the past three years since coming together as Bio-Techne. All but ACD are nearly fully integrated and we are proud of the way the employees from all the sites have worked together to build a new and exciting innovative culture here. Commercial synergies are a priority. We now have a sales force that has expertise in both instruments and consumables, which together provide our customers with world-class solutions in science. Progress has also been exceptional with our Cyvek, PrimeGene, and Novis acquisitions. Novis has had a stellar year with growth now running at near 10%. Cyvek, or SimplePlex, as it\u2019s now called, is filling as a business, coming off of some [indiscernible] just released. We still see huge potential with this business. Roche, as an example, is using this technology is three clinical studies and has offered support for technology by hosting webinars with our staff. PrimeGene completed a new state of the art factory in Shanghai dedicated to the development and production of GMP proteins. With the help of PrimeGene, our China for China business has experienced strong double digit growth. Following the ACD acquisition, our pipeline of potential M&A targets remains strong. And importantly, our strong balance sheet and cash flow leaves plenty of dry powder for the ongoing execution of our disciplined M&A strategy. We plan to continue to augment our organic business with acquisitions that strengthen our position in existing businesses and geographies, or leverage our reagent expertise in adjacent markets. In closing, our leadership team has spent a lot of time this year reviewing and thinking about our strategy and strategic plan. We are three years into the five year plan we initiated in 2014, and we have stayed very true to [Indiscernible]. Nine acquisitions later, 230% growth in headcount, 22 sites versus 7, and 100 people in China instead of 12, a subsidiary model with 3 well designed divisions in 3 regions, are all a testament to the significant progress we have made. And the growth isn\u2019t bad either, with 304 million in revenue in 2013 versus nearly 500 million this year, in 2016. This is all great, but we want to become $1 billion plus business with continued strong profitability. Toward this goal, our strategic plan pillars have remained the same. Enable and sponsor innovation in the core product lines; geographic expansion; commercial execution, operational excellence, account recruitments and retention. We have tactical plans for all of these strategies and resources and the people to achieve them. I\u2019m very proud of our teams and the progress to date. The Company\u2019s coming to a true inflection point in growth as we integrate the strategic acquisitions to date, as well as improve internal operations for growth. Fiscal 2017 will be a great year. And I look forward to having our leadership team share more details about our strategic plan at our inaugural Bio Techne Investor Day in New York City on September 15. I hope to see you all there.  With that, I will pass the call over to Jim for a more detailed review of the fourth quarter financials before we open the line for Q&A. Jim Hippel : Thank you, Chuck. As on our prior earnings calls, I will provide an overview of our Q4 financial performance for the total Company and then provide some color on each of our three segments.  Starting with the overall fourth quarter financial performance, adjusted earnings increased 3% year over year to 34.5 million, while adjusted EPS was $0.92 a share versus $0.90 in the prior year. The impact of foreign exchange fluctuations represented a large headwind to EPS, approximately $0.06. The more pronounced foreign exchange impact to our adjusted EPS results is due primarily to the British pound volatility related to the Brexit outcome at the end of the quarter.  As a reminder, our European headquarters is in the UK, making the British pound our functional currency in Europe, which unfavorably impacted our European transactional assets in the quarter. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.69 compared to $0.71 in the prior year. Q4 reported revenue was 134.8 million, an increase of 15% year over year, with organic revenue increasing 10%. Fourth quarter reported sales include a 6% growth contribution from acquisitions, partially offset by a 1% unfavorable foreign exchange headwind. Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total Company adjusted gross margin was 70.1% in Q4, decreasing 70 basis points in the prior year. Strong volume leverage and productivity gains were more than offset by the lower margin Cliniqa acquisition and unfavorable FX impact. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and FX, core gross margins improved 7 basis points year over year in the fourth quarter. Adjusted SG&A in Q4 was 22.5% of revenue, 160 basis points higher than last year. The SG&A increase was driven by the acquisitions made since the beginning of the fourth quarter of last year, investments made in China, and Chinese corporate-related expenses. R&D expense in Q4 was 8.6% of revenue, 60 basis points lower than last year, reflecting the volume leverage achieved while purchasing platforms and biotech division. The resulting adjusted operating margin for Q4 was 39.1%, a decrease of 170 basis points from the prior period. Looking at our numbers below operating income, net interest expense in Q4 was $0.4 million compared to $0.3 million of net interest expense last year due to higher draws on a line of credit which partially funded our Cliniqa acquisition last July. Other non-operating expense in the quarter was $1.9 million compared to $0.9 million of non-operating income in the prior year quarter. This unfavorable transactional FX explains this year-over-year variance. Our adjusted effective tax rate in Q4 was 31.6%, an increase of 40 basis points in the fourth quarter of last year due to a greater percentage of taxable income being generated in the U.S., driven in part by the Cliniqa acquisition. In terms of returning capital, we continued to pay our dividend and paid out $11.9 million in the quarter. Average diluted shares were relatively flat over the year ago period at 37.4 million shares outstanding. Turning to cash flow on the balance sheet, $36.3 million of cash was generated from operations in the fourth quarter and our investment in capital expenditures was $3 million. We ended the quarter with $95.8 million of cash in short-term available-for-sale investments. Our long-term debt obligations at the end of Q4 stood a $126.5 million, a decrease of $31.3 million from the end of Q3. Going forward our capital deployment priorities remain opportunistic M&A, our dividend, and debt pay down. Now I\u2019ll discuss the performance of our three business segments, starting with the biotechnology segment. Q4 reported sales were $84.4 million, with organic growth of 8%. Foreign exchange negatively impacted reported results growth by approximately 1%. By geography, the U.S. grew in the high single digits, with upper single-digit biopharma sales growth and mid-single-digit academia results. Europe increased approximately 10% organically, with biopharma and academia sales in this region growing in line with the overall geography. As we discussed in the third quarter earnings call, timing of the Easter holiday impacted our European results, representing a favorable 5% impact to growth in this geography. China experienced organic growth in the mid teens during the fourth quarter and delivered 20% organic revenue growth for the fiscal year 2016. Excluding Japan and China, the rest of APAC grew 20% organically in the fourth quarter. Japan continued to be a drag on growth, given the challenging government funding conditions there. Adjusting operating income for the biotech segment increased 5% in Q4 compared to the prior year, and adjusted operating margin was 52.4%, an increase, sorry, decrease, of 100 basis points year-over-year, due to the timing of website enhancements and certain commercial investments, particularly in China, partially offset by volume leverage and productivity initiatives. As we look ahead to fiscal year 2017, our latest acquisition, Advanced Cell Diagnostics, or ACD, will be included in our biotechnology segment beginning in the first quarter. Turning now to clinical controls, segment sales in Q4 were $28.5 million, with reported growth of 33% over last year. The acquisition of Cliniqa contributed 30% to growth while organic revenue increased 3%. Strong growth in the hematology controls business was partially offset by the timing of new OEM projects in our blood glucose business. Separately, beginning in Q1 of FY17, we have analyzed the Cliniqa acquisition, and this business will be included in our organic growth going forward. Clinical control adjusted operating income increased 36% in Q4, and adjusted operating margin was 31.4%, an increase of 80 basis points from the prior year. The higher adjusted operating margin was primarily attributable to productivity initiatives, partially offset by the mix of a lower margin Cliniqa acquisition. Moving on to our protein platform segment, net sales in Q4 were 22 million, an organic increase of 29% from the prior year period, with unfavorable currency translation impacting revenues by approximately 1%. Growth for the segment was broad-based with most major regions and product lines growing by solid double digits and also includes a favorable contribution from the full quarter sales from our next-generation iCE instrument, Maurice. Adjusted operating income in Q4 for the protein platform segment was 1.6 million, representing an operating margin of 7.5% compared to approximately breakeven operating income one year ago. Strong volume leverage drove a year-over-year improvement, partially offset by the operating costs associated with the Zephyrus acquisition. We continue to expect additional improvement in protein platform\u2019s profitability, as topline growth and productivity gains drive operating leverage next year and beyond. In summary, Q4 was a strong quarter for Bio-Techne with solid commercial and operational executions driving the best organic growth performance in many years. This capped off a solid full year with 6% organic growth in fiscal year 2017. Looking ahead to fiscal year 2017, we expect overall Company organic growth to be similar. Additionally, the acquisitions made in fiscal year 2016 and this past July should add another $35 million of revenue to the topline in fiscal year \u201817. Foreign exchange, however, will continue to be a revenue headwind at approximately 1%, if rates stay where they\u2019re at today. We are very pleased to include ACD and the other recent acquisitions in our upcoming fiscal year results although I would advise that collectively these businesses are currently projected to be dilutive to our operating income in the coming year. Overall, we anticipate adjusted total Company operating margin for fiscal 2017 to be in the mid 30%s, with this metric improving throughout the year as we realize volume leverage from the acquisitions. I\u2019d also like to remind everyone that Bio-Techne assumed an additional $250 million in debt to fund the ACD acquisition, with the associated interest expense expected to also impact our bottom-line results for the year. That concludes my prepared comments, and with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Rachelle to open the line for some questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question we will hear from Amanda Murphy with William Blair. Amanda Murphy : I just had -- two actually. One is on ProteinSimple. So obviously that business line in general has been doing quite well, and you had mentioned a few quarters ago that you had some sales force turnover. I just was wondering if you could give a little more context around how you guys have worked to turn that business around in quite a rapid fashion? Just looking for a little more context on performance there. Chuck Kummeth : Sure Amanda. Well, we were very transparent starting about a year ago and we saw the growth rates slipping dramatically. And when you do an acquisition in Silicon Valley, you can expect about a quarter of the people to leave and head on and buy the next lottery ticket. We did see a lot of that. In fact, four of the top five managing teams moved on and we expected that. We kept [indiscernible] key guys was the Head of R&D and Development he has run the business for us and has done a great job. The commercial team however was definitely a little more lacking than we thought and we had to make additional changes quite early, and you guys know all about that. So overall, we turned over roughly 60% of commercial organization, including marketing some of those early first couple of quarters, which obviously is going to cause a big hit to the business and top lines. But those changes were made, I think, very well and very soundly and with great new people, great new head of marketing. We\u2019ve changed the whole way we go to market, we\u2019ve changed the way we address the customer, we\u2019ve change the collateral, we\u2019ve change the way we address customers at their trade shows. And most importantly, we\u2019ve done a lot of synergy work with the biotech divisions. The instruments need reagents. Now we did this acquisition because there\u2019s a lot of synergies with reagents of R&D Systems branded products. They\u2019ve been working together quite strong, quite well. Our head of our commercial organization in the North America, Europe, and Asia side, biotech has worked closely with the organization there in protein platforms, and that also has paid off. We actually have new organizational work together on leads, drive the leads, both reagents [Indiscernible] the hardware side, and so we get new customers from both sides of this, which is working. Which we thought it would work. I guess that\u2019s really whether we can say right now. The marketing looks solid. Our lead generation is up dramatically over a year ago, and we\u2019re making progress.  Now, say we\u2019re going to we were 25% last quarter, 29% this quarter. Also the first two quarters of last year about flat or negative. I don\u2019t we\u2019re not going to sit here and say we\u2019re to be 30% or plus going forward. But I do think double digit growth going forward is what we\u2019ve been telling people, and we expect that. If we don\u2019t get that, we will make more changes. This is a great and it\u2019s not a one trick pony anymore. It\u2019s not just a western blot platform. As we mentioned, we\u2019ve got three solid platforms in this division, all driving growth all working at double digit growth right now. So, that provides more safety as well. It should get near to $100 million business this year, and we hope, as we mentioned, we think it\u2019s got legs to get to $100 million or so higher. This year, positions in western blot and below is still single digits here. We\u2019ve got a lot of room. And the biologics side is a nice surprise, the way it\u2019s growing. It\u2019s also a decent market. Then there are new applications coming out all the time. New papers coming out. We\u2019ve been very thrilled with the acceptance we\u2019ve seen, and we\u2019re hoping we\u2019re actually crossing an inflection point, continuing the strong growth we\u2019re seeing. We will see. Amanda Murphy : I think you said in the past that you think you can get to roughly 750 million revenue with the businesses you have now incorporating synergies. Is that still a fair assessment? Chuck Kummeth : I think with ACD in the mix, that\u2019s probably we were saying more like 650 million, 700 million with all of the currency hits before that. But it\u2019s in that range. We cannot get to 1 billion without further acquisitions, but I think, run the math, run the models, run our growth rate of 8% or so or plus going forward, we should get close to that. Important factor, we also want to get these margins strong as well, so it goes together. Amanda Murphy : That was going to be my next question on the margin side. So obviously, you had some underlying margin expansion, but then offset by currency and transaction. So maybe just give a little perspective on what you\u2019re doing just from an underlying perspective. And then when you think about margin, I think you\u2019ve been pretty disciplined about the platforms you\u2019re bringing online and where they sit from a margin perspective in your business. But just remind us what your target margins might look like. Chuck Kummeth : No one is more disappointed than us to see the last week of the quarter, the Brexit hit and what we took with that, because we\u2019re UK based in Europe; we\u2019re a U.S. based business here. So, it is what it is there. We\u2019ll dig out of that pretty quickly we think. Last quarter, we beat pretty soundly at 42.5% op margins [indiscernible] closer to plan, I think 39% or right around that range. And as Jim mentioned, with the dilution this coming year with ACD and then Zephyrus, what we\u2019re doing, mid 30%s is a safe number. And we\u2019ll be climbing back to that 40%, working on productivity, working on synergies and doing what we\u2019ve done already a couple of times. We have been in this high 30% before and clawed our way back to 40%, and we\u2019ve mentioned that and we\u2019re going to drive that. So productivity is going to be key. We will not over-invest. We\u2019re going to try to invest in systems and people and things that create synergies and can create value. We\u2019ve got a pretty good team, a lot of experience and a lot of big companies that know how to do this. We actually have more opportunities, more things prioritizing than we can even do. So the list of things we\u2019d like to do is a pretty long list. So I mentioned, we\u2019re disciplined, we think we are very disciplined. And we understand how important it is to keep the margin in focus and I think we\u2019ve done a really good job [indiscernible]. Amanda Murphy : So are you thinking you can be back to 40% within, coming out of next year? Chuck Kummeth : That\u2019s hard to say. I doubt it. I think we will see how, ACD is in the press release. We bought them, and in the trailing 12 months, they were over a 50% grower. If we can keep that going, then who knows? It\u2019s a business like our business. They make reagents, put them in little tubes, stick them in a box and sell them as kits with very high gross margins; we like that kind of business. And if that growth rate continues, it\u2019s going to climb in the profitability range very quickly. And we\u2019re going to, we have not discussed where the synergy is commercially. We\u2019ve invested as a Company commercially, and that\u2019s why they\u2019re at where they\u2019re at. And we have to wait out an 18-month earn out, work together with them, but there is a lot of synergies. But for sure, China and Europe, there\u2019s a little Company did not leverage the reach we have. So we\u2019ll see how fast they can dig into the land of profitability. But to say they\u2019re going to give us 3, 4, 5 points of margin for the Company, that\u2019s probably a reach. But we\u2019ll see. Operator : Next move to Catherine Ramsey with Robert W Baird. Catherine Ramsey : Good morning, guys. Congrats on the great quarter. You\u2019ve had pretty impressive growth on the biotechnology segment over the last few quarters. What do you think has been the biggest factor in that? How sustainable is the mid to high single-digit pace going forward? Chuck Kummeth : If you back up a year or two, we talked about when you annualize these acquisitions, they were strong growers. We should be in that 8 to 12 range, which is a pretty big band, I understand that, and we\u2019re kind of there now. It really comes down to, if ProteinSimple stays in that 20% region or better, we\u2019re going to be, should be at 1% or better. The better question is, why is biotech division doing so well? It\u2019s continued to do well five, six quarters in a row. We had an 8% quarter; this is really sound. And it\u2019s just not just one reason, thank God for that. The website has been an amazing success. But academia, which is still a big portion of our business, it\u2019s something like $800,000 or whatever report you want to believe. But our average order size, remember, is still like $900 or something like that. So you have to deal with this model of growth through the web. You can\u2019t touch all of these people with just sales. You have to have a model that has a really nice quick, sharp-type web engine, an SEO engine, and then delivery mechanism. And we\u2019ve overhauled ours and it\u2019s working well. With more online activity and more touches on our website, you get more orders, and that\u2019s one piece. Fisher Helms started out slow last year for us but ended pretty well and things were improving. I think they had their own growing and band of pains with absorbing life tech. And movement internally with their TSRs, which we\u2019re constantly retraining now and stuff. So that\u2019s improving as well. We\u2019re depending on Fisher still, and it\u2019s helping. And then biotech pharma has been strong and remains strong, and it\u2019s even getting better. And we\u2019re doing a lot more, we\u2019ll call it custom work. We\u2019re doing -- we\u2019re developing -- we\u2019re getting more known in the industry and we\u2019re being approached more and more for very difficult assignments for developing reagents, proteins, antibodies, etcetera for these customers and being paid an amazingly nice premium for it. And there\u2019s a nice reorder benefit as well. Roughly about half of that work is going in our catalog, so we like it. And that\u2019s why we see this 500% increase [indiscernible]. There\u2019s a lot of those things, those three things we stay in place, I think you\u2019re going to see biotech division in the mid single digits or better in the growth region. That\u2019s what we expect. That was the plan and we are executing to that point so. Catherine Ramsey : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then on your last earnings call, you mentioned starting phase one of your ERP system in July. Any color on how that is progressing? Chuck Kummeth : Say it again? Oh, ERP. I\u2019ve been involved in five of them; none of them have ever been flawless. We\u2019ve all heard horror stories with some of our peers are really suffering. I come from a very large Company that actually had operations shut down for weeks. We\u2019ve seen none of that, but we are definitely seeing the pain in the first month of the preliminary ERP. We are ready for it; we have temps in place. We are working through digging it out. We expect to be in decent shape end of the quarter. And you have the usual stuff -- you\u2019ve got back orders growing wild. You find out that orders are held up because one stock number was screwed up or wasn\u2019t right and so it\u2019s holding up the order. We have the usual percentage of customer information is inaccurate, so it\u2019s not going out being held up the order. So you have got to claw through all of that stuff. And we\u2019re not making airplanes here, right? It\u2019s a complex business. There\u2019s a lot of products, a lot of orders, a lot of SKUs, which is the life blood of what EFP is supposed to handle with all of that complexity. So even though we\u2019re just a $500 million business, we have the complexity of something much larger. So overall, I\u2019m actually pretty impressed. This is by far one of the better ERP implementations we\u2019ve done. But we\u2019ve definitely have some work to do to be to claim victory and say we\u2019re really humming along here like we are say with the website design. So it will take a quarter or two, I think, to work out all the kinks. But it is what it is; it\u2019s ERP. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Next we will move to Paul Knight with Janney Montgomery Scott. Unidentified Analyst : Hello, good morning. This is actually Katerina Ivana Vintasoe [ph] on for Paul Knight. What are the end markets driving the strong growth that you are seeing in China? Also, what are the segments or line of products that are finding their -- more momentum there? Chuck Kummeth : That\u2019s a good question. I\u2019m actually not that happy with China this last quarter; it\u2019s actually our worst quarter in years here, with mid-teen growth. And the reason for that is this bayou scandal that\u2019s happened. We sell a lot of products into what we call the academic therapeutics, where we had institutions working on therapies without re-approval of the CFDA. So the CFDA now has their hooks into all this and the government has shut down a lot on what\u2019s going on in academia. And you\u2019ve got to realize, academia in China is a lot bigger percentage of the overall market that it is anywhere else because China funds academia very well, as you know. We\u2019re talking about hundreds of institutions. So we took a bit of a hit there, but for the year it was 20% growth, which part of your question is very good number. Then last year we were like 25% and it was like 25% as well. We see that continuing, even as we scale. We\u2019re still not that big in China. I think when you add all our businesses together with PPD as well, I think we\u2019re roughly a $40 million business, it was $12 million three years ago, so we\u2019ve come a long way, but there\u2019s a way to go. The key to China is customers, customers, customers. It\u2019s a direct model and we keep adding sales people, you cover it province and city-by-city. We have to have strong leaders. We\u2019ve had almost zero attrition, which is remarkable. The leadership we have in China as well as overall Asia is wonderful. And we did a good job with our people; we hired great people. We constantly have really good people trying to get to us. R&D Systems brand is really well known in China. As, many of the leaders of institutions in China running things academia wise are actually Chinese, but they\u2019re U.S. Chinese. They are U.S. citizens; they are people that have gone back. They call them sea turtles. We have a large amount of researchers in China that actually were educated in the U.S. but know our brand and know our Company. So, we really carry the same weight there as we do here in the U.S., known for our premium brand, our quality, our service etcetera and so on. That is the key to it and we hope to leverage that across the new businesses. Our ACD people as well as the [Indiscernible]. And we\u2019ve not seen that chapter hit yet. That chapter is still yet to come. When that takes off it will get even better. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, great. And then outside China, have you started seen a pickup in academic spending, and in particular, in the U.S.? Chuck Kummeth : You\u2019re asking, is there\u2019s an academic increase? Unidentified Analyst : Yes. Chuck Kummeth : We did see an academic increase this quarter. We did pretty well. In China, I would say it\u2019s about like the same thing I mentioned. I think it\u2019s mostly academic anyway. We would still put the business we had supporting therapeutics there with academia, and that took a little bit of a hit this quarter. We think it will take about a year to work through that; it\u2019s not going to be near as tough as the last couple of years, as they run through their corruption scandal policies, etcetera. So we will see. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Chuck Kummeth : We enjoy a wonderful POL network in China. The team there are doctors and scientists themselves; they know each other pretty well. I\u2019m very pleased with our POL network and the visibility we get, the trade shows we drive; there\u2019s literally dozens. We run a good operation and so it\u2019s for selling new hostages for agents and so we\u2019re now, our focus going forward now is really getting instruments pretty aligned and synergistic with that core business, just like we\u2019ve done here. It\u2019s working well [Indiscernible]. Operator : And next we move on to Matt Hewitt with Craig-Hallum Capital Group. Matt Hewitt : Good morning, gentlemen. Congratulations on the strong quarter. Chuck Kummeth : Thank you. Matt Hewitt : A couple of questions for me. First, regarding the academic market here domestically NIH funding. I think with the 6% increase this year, I think there was a lot of expectations that it was going to take a year before you really started to see the benefit from that increase, paying salary increases and all of that. But it appears that you\u2019re actually starting to see some benefit already. Is that the case? And what does that mean or imply for next year with the additional increase? Chuck Kummeth : We went through the math on this a few quarters ago, what we were going to get from this. And we came to the conclusion we\u2019d probably achieve about a 1% gain because we\u2019d have a tailwind from the NIH funding. The amounts that trickle down through all that, that actually hit the reagents budgets, okay? So, I think there is some help. You\u2019ve heard a lot of our peers have talked about they think the second half of this calendar year is going to see more of a funding hit. I think we\u2019re in the reagents side, we\u2019re seeing some [Indiscernible]. I tease my commercial folks who are they\u2019ve got their chests puffed up pretty hard this last quarters with such strong growth. But they\u2019re getting some help for sure. They\u2019re probably at least in that 1% range is probably NIH funding, and just a better attitude. We\u2019re going the other direction. They\u2019re not cutting anymore, they\u2019re starting to figure out where to add, right? Matt Hewitt : Okay, great. And then maybe a little bit of a strategic question, but with the acquisition of Advanced Cell Diagnostics, this is your first move into genomics. Do you envision essentially building out a fourth reporting segment, where this will be the building block of that division? Or was this just an opportunity to expand a little bit more for that existing segment? Chuck Kummeth : A couple of things. First of all, when you think of our core business, we really are a picks and shovels provider to areas like cancer research, stem cell, and we\u2019re known for quality. So we\u2019re the selection of choice by, especially biotech pharma. And coming back hard in the academic side. We see ACD is the same thing. To say that we\u2019re right in the sweet spot of genomic ACD is probably a reach. It\u2019s really a picks and shovels Company as well, in genomics. Certainly GM aided in 9,000 probes is products. But we like it because it\u2019s reagents. It\u2019s a kit business, it\u2019s just like our business, and it gets us into that area where we know how to provide picks and shovels. On the clinical control side, same thing, diagnostics. We\u2019re not a full-fledged diagnostics Company, but we supply the upstream reagents, chemistries, kits to the big guys, every one of the big guys that make true diagnostics that are, they go through the pain and agony of the qualifications and regulatory, and we haven\u2019t had to do that. We\u2019re drifting in that direction. We\u2019ve been very clear we would like to get into some of that, maybe in China and some things. We\u2019re very opportunistic, but we\u2019re not going to go full into it. You look at this last quarter on diagnostics : there\u2019s not many doing so well in diagnostics; it\u2019s been a rough quarter. It\u2019s an area you\u2019ve got to be careful, we think. Same thing for genomics. We like the reagents, the support side of the business to start with, and we\u2019ll see. Now with that business, growth beyond $100 million or so, I\u2019ve been very clear, we\u2019d like to continue to build out our regional subsidiary model. We have three divisions today, work on three regions. Five or six divisions would be great, and could be diagnostics, could be genomics, could be media. These are all areas that are very strong adjacencies to what we do today. And as we build critical mass, we\u2019ll make new divisions and in the reported segments. To start with, we won\u2019t be doing that with ACD. They have an 18-month earn out, so there\u2019s, we\u2019ll provide upside help, but they have to be a little bit autonomous for 18 months and then we\u2019ll see how they do. If they get big enough, maybe. More likely an initial, initially they\u2019ll be part of biotech division, but it is too early to call that one. Matt Hewitt : Okay, great. Thank you. Chuck Kummeth : It is research only, right? So, anyway. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Chuck Kummeth for any additional or closing remarks. Chuck Kummeth : Alright. Well, our strongest quarter in years, we have certainly enjoyed seeing 10%. We\u2019re definitely focused on our margins and we\u2019re focused on synergy. We have got more to bake in here. We\u2019re working hard on it, you can be sure of that. Thank you all for joining the call and we will see you hopefully soon. And if not, in New York. Okay? Bye. Operator : That will conclude today\u2019s call. We thank you for your participation.",

Baird Matt Hewitt - Craig Hallum Capital Group Carolina Ibanez - Janney Montgomery Scott Operator : Good morning and welcome to the Bio-Techne Earnings Conference Call for the First Quarter of Fiscal Year 2017. At this time, all participants have been placed in listen-only mode and the call will be open for questions following management's prepared remarks. Today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jim Hippel, Bio-Techne's Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead sir. Jim Hippel : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me this morning is Chuck Kummeth, Chief Executive Officer of Bio-Techne. Before we begin, let me briefly cover our Safe Harbor statement. Some of the comments made during this conference call may be considered forward-looking statements, including beliefs and expectations about the Company's future results. The Company's 10-K for fiscal year 2016 identifies certain factors that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements made during this call. The Company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of any new information, or future events or developments. The 10-K, as well as the Company's other SEC filings, are available on the Company's Web site within its Investor Relations section. During the call, non-GAAP financial measures may be used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. Tables reconciling these measures to most comparable GAAP measures are available in the Company's press release issued early this morning on the Bio-Techne Corporation Web site at www.bio-techne.com. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Chuck. Chuck Kummeth : Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter conference call. You'll recall from our last quarterly earnings conference call that we finished our fiscal year 2016 on a strong note. I'm happy to report that our momentum is carried into our first quarter and we have started fiscal year 2017 also on a strong note. The company delivered 10% organic growth in the quarter with solid growth in all three of our divisions and in all three of our major geographic regions. This topline performance also flowed down to our bottom line with strong operational performance increasing adjusted operating margins in our core businesses and adjusted EPS growing 11% after excluding the negative impact from FX. The Biotech division completed its sixth quarter in a row in mid-to-high, single-digit organic growth. All three of the division's main product categories protein, antibodies, and assays performed well. Antibodies performed particularly well growing double-digit in the quarter with our strategy becoming the customary agent supplier for pharma and others continues to bear fruit. Our focus on being a lead supplier of multiplex assays also has demonstrated in the quarter with double- digit growth in sales and royalties for this product line. I should also add that our Minneapolis site which manufactures majority of products for the Biotech division launched a completely new ERP system in July for the first quarter. While implementation of our new ERP system often has issues which causes business disruptions and we experienced a few as well. The team here in Minneapolis did a tremendous job pulling together to ensure our customers are served as they have come to expect from our new systems, our gold standard brand and quality reagents service. I'm pleased to report that system is fully functional as we head into Q2, and the effort by the team is now focused on gains, internal efficiencies, we expect to receive from replacing a 30 year old technology with a modern 21st century ERP platform. In the Biotech segment we also closed on the Advanced Cell Diagnostics acquisitions, or ACD, in August. As a reminder, ACD marks Bio-Techne's entry into the genomics field and market. Second, and more importantly, its innovative and versatile technology has potential to change pathology practices. RNA-ISH is a transformative technology facilitating and improving the monitoring of gene expression patterns at the single-cell level, while retaining the morphological context of the tissue being analyzed. ACD's technology serves both research and diagnostic markets expanding Bio-Techne's presence in the clinical lab setting. In just the past couple of months, the commercial teams of both ACD and the Bio-Techne division have been meeting in Europe, Asia, and here in the U.S. for identifying ways to leverage Bio-Techne's marketing and sales channels to further accelerate adoption of ACD's technology. In addition, ACD continues to leverage its core technology into new products. In Q1, two new [indiscernible] products were launched - first the BaseScope which is the breakthrough next-gen technology capable of splice junction and mutation detection. And second, it's first fully automated multiplex fluorescent RNAscope assay for the LDS platform. These are just examples of both the innovation and collaboration that contribute to over 50% sales growth for ACD this quarter on a standalone basis. Moving on to Protein Platforms. This division also continued with its momentum from the second half of fiscal year 2016 growing organically by 20% in the third quarter. This marks the third quarter in a row of over 20% organic growth. Our recently launched new iCE instrument, Maurice, continues to be well received by customers leading the biologics product line to strong, double-digit growth. Meanwhile placements of Ella our automated multi ELISA instrument also accelerated Simple Plex revenue nearly 150% in the quarter, and while not counted in our organic growth, Protein Platforms launched its first automated single-cell western blot instrument Milo in July. You will recall the technology of this instrument was acquired as part of the Zephyrus acquisition we made back in March. The initial interest of customers in this product have exceeded our expectations and we've already sold a number of these instruments in the quarter. The Simple Western product line, led by the West instruments, continues to be adopted with the new standard for the way western blots are done in the lab. We continue to see double-digit percentage increases in the usage of existing instrument placements and momentum for additional placements worldwide. In Q1, we combined the US sales force structure of our biotech and Protein Platforms division to further enhance our solution-based offerings we bring our core customers. With a unified sales approach, we can better demonstrate to our customers that we provide the instruments to simplify and enhance the researchers' workload that, together with our reagents, ensure the best results for their experiments. We are already seeing another upswing in lead generation from this new approach with physicians and product lines all for the rest of the year. When we acquired ProteinSimple, the business was positioned as a one product platform company based on the simple Western technology. Now the Protein Platforms division has four with upgrades in biological with Marie, and single cell with Milo and the Ella platform acquired with CyVek has demonstrated in Q1 Protein Platforms has a diversified product offering that will continue commercial penetration and product innovation allowance with several avenues with the aim of consistent growth for years to come. Finally, our Diagnostics division achieved fantastic growth of 19% in the quarter. We experienced strong growth with our OEM customers in both glucose and blood gas control. Much of the price pressure we saw last year in the glucose market has now annualized, so we are past that headwind. As for blood gas, CLIA has increased in 4% end users to use these controls on their instruments, which of course is beneficial to our business. On the assay development side of the Diagnostics business, growth was also strong, particularly for the point of care market where there continues to be many new projects that result in development opportunities for custom reagents and controls. However, as we have said before, due to the OEM nature of this business, customer requests for deliveries can be lumpy, and Q1 benefited from this lumpiness. We do expect fiscal year 2017 to be a great year for the Diagnostics division with growth averaging mid to high single digits for the year. Moving on to some commentary regarding our regional and end market performance, in short, growth in all of our major regions and end markets was very similar to what we have seen in the past several quarters. Both Europe and the US saw mid-single-digit growth in the academia market and high single-digit growth in biopharma. In Europe, we completed and fully integrated the acquisition of SPACE, our key distributor for Italy and southern Europe. I spent some time in Milan this quarter with our Bio-Techne team there and was very pleased with the leadership and collaboration already taking place with our existing sales reps in the area from the another division. This fine addition to Bio-Techne as well as the support of our new leader for the overall EMEA region will make this a full Bio-Techne subsidiary for southern Europe that will drive growth in the region for the entire Company. Moving onto Asia, the themes we saw for most of fiscal year 2015 continued into the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. In China, most of our brands grew well north of 20% in Q1. The one exception continued to be PrimeGene, which is heavily impacted by the CFDA crackdown on cell therapies administrated by hospitals due to the PrimeGene scandal earlier this year. PrimeGene is a key supplier of reagents to hospitals who use these therapies. We believe the CFDA will provide regulations for hospitals using cell therapies which will stimulate growth in this treatment again, and PrimeGene is well-positioned to fully participate in this growth. As for the rest of APAC, overall, the region continues to perform well. We've continued areas -- we experienced areas of strength with our great distributor partners in Korea and India. Japan continues to lag due to local funding pressure, although the rate of decline appears to be bottoming out. In closing, we started our fiscal 2017 in much the way we ended our fiscal 2016. Our organic growth is strong and broad-based. The integration of our businesses and new ways of innovating science synergies is ongoing. We continue to increase the margins of our core business. We closed on three more great acquisitions which will accelerate our organic growth and profits for years to come. Our capital allocation strategy remains focused on M&A. Our pipeline of potential M&A targets remains strong and we plan to continue to augment our organic business of acquisitions that strengthen our positions in existing businesses and geographies or to leverage our reagents expertise to take to market. I want to thank our customers who continue to choose Bio-Techne's tools for their lifetime's research and our employees for dedication and determination to serve those customers well. Jim, I'll pass the call over to you for more detailed review of the first-quarter financials before we open it up the lines to Q&A. Jim Hippel : Great. Thanks Chuck. I will provide an overview of our Q1 financial performance with total company and then provide some color on each of our three segments. Starting with the overall first quarter financial performance, adjusted earnings increased 8% year-over-year to $31.6 million, while adjusted EPS was $0.84 a share versus $0.79 in the prior year. The impact of foreign exchange fluctuations represented a headwind EPS, approximately $0.03. Most of this FX impact which is a short term exchange, great volatility in Q1 of fiscal year '16. This volatility produced transactional FX in last year. The quarter below adjusted operating margin did not repeat again Q1 of this fiscal year. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.43 compared to $0.61 in the prior year. The biggest driver for the lower GAAP earnings are non-cash purchase accounting costs associated with the recent acquisitions. Q1 reported revenue was $130.6 million, an increase of 16% year-over-year, with organic revenue increasing 10%. First-quarter reported sales included a 7% growth contribution from acquisition partially offset by a 1% unfavorable foreign exchange headwind. By geography, both the US and Europe grew in the high single digits with upper single digit biopharma sales growth and mid-single-digit academia results. China experienced organic growth nearly 20% during the fourth quarter with higher growth in our western brand being slightly offset by the impact of the bribery scandal on our local PrimeGene brand. The brand continue to be a drag on growth, given the challenging government funding conditions with organic growth declining in the mid single digits. Excluding Japan and China, the rest of APAC were in the high teens organic in the first quarter. Note that all references made to growth rates by region and end markets exclude our own end sales, which mostly occur in our Diagnostics segment. Moving onto the details of the P&L, total Company adjusted gross margin was an even 71% in Q1, increasing 40 basis points from the prior year. With the Protein Platforms and Diagnostics segments growing at a faster rate than the Biotech segment, the unfavorable mix results which was more than offset by productivity being as well as positive gross margin contributions and recent acquisitions. ACD in particular contributed gross margins exceeding 80%. FX had a nominal impact on adjusted gross margins throughout the year. Adjusted SG&A in Q4 was 24.9% of revenue, 160 basis points higher than last year. The SG&A increase was driven by the acquisitions made since the beginning of the first quarter of last year and strategic investments made in our core businesses to support growth. R&D expense in Q1 was 9.8% of revenue, 30 basis points lower than last year, reflecting the volume leverage achieved from our Protein Platforms and Biotech divisions. The resulting adjusted operating margin for Q1 was 36.3%, a decrease of 100 basis points from the prior-year period. The recent acquisitions contributed 140 points of the improvement. Looking at our numbers below operating income, net interest expense in Q1 was $1.3 million compared to $0.4 million of net interest expense last year. The higher interest expense is due to a $400 million line of credit which was opened in Q1 to replace our existing $150 million line of credit, as well as fund the acquisition ACD in August. Other nonoperating expense for the quarter was essentially nil compared to $1.2 million of nonoperating income in the prior-year quarter. This favorable transactional FX in the prior year did not repeat this year. Our adjusted effective tax rate in Q1 was 31.4%, an increase of 30 basis points from the fourth quarter of last year due to a -- first quarter of last year due to a greater percentage of taxable income being generated in the U.S. In terms of returning capital, we continue to pay our dividend and paid out $11.9 million in the quarter. Average diluted shares were up less than 1% over the year-ago period at 37.5 million shares outstanding. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, $26.1 million of cash was generated from operations in the first quarter and our investment in capital expenditures was $2.4 million. The new ERP system we implemented in July delayed some customer invoices until late in the quarter, driving our quarter end Accounts Receivable balance approximately $10 million higher. We expect these outstanding receivables to be fully collected in Q2. We ended the quarter with $122 million of cash and short-term available-for-sale investments. Our long-term debt obligations at the end of Q1 stood at $375.9 million, an increase of $245.9 million from the end of Q4, reflecting the additional line of credit used to purchase ACD. Going forward, our capital deployment priorities remain opportunistic M&A, our dividend, and debt pay down. Now, I'll discuss the performance of our three business segments, starting with the Biotech segment. Q1 reported sales were $86.8 million with reported revenue increasing 15%. Acquisitions contributed 10% to revenue growth. Foreign exchange negatively impacted growth by 1%, and organic growth was 6%. Organic growth was broad-based in all major product line divisions. Adjusted operating income for the Biotech segment increased 8% in Q1 compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 48.9%, an increase of 300 basis points -- a decrease of 300 basis points year-over-year due entirely to the mix of recent acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, adjusted operating margins were essentially flat to prior year. Turning now to the Diagnostics segment, reported revenues in Q1 was $24.2 million, which reported an organic growth of 19% over last year. Strong growth in glucose and blood gas control as well as continued strength in diagnostic assay reagent sales drove the growth. As in past quarters, timing of only on orders also impacted growth, this time favorably in Q1. Due to the fluctuations of OEM ordering patterns form quarter to quarter, management also monitors trailing 12-month revenue growth to smooth out these timing impacts. For the end of Q1, trailing 12 months revenue growth for the Diagnostics segment was 11%. Diagnostics segment adjusted operating income increased 34% in Q1 and adjusted operating margin was 21%, an increase of 290 basis points from the prior year. The higher adjusted operating margin is primarily attributable to higher volume leverage. Moving on to our Protein Platforms segment, net sales in Q1 were $19.6 million, an organic increase of 20% from the prior-year period, with recent acquisitions contributing 1% to growth and favorable currency translations impacting revenues by approximately 1%. Growth in this segment was broad-based with most major regions in product lines growing by double digits with particular contribution from our next generation iCE instrument, Maurice. Adjusted operating income in Q1 for the Protein Platforms segment was $0.2 million, representing an adjusted operating margin of 1.1%, compared to a $1.2 million adjusted operating loss from a year ago. Strong volume leverage drove the year-over-year improvement, partially offset by the operating trials associated with the Zephyrus acquisition and favorable FX. Without these headwinds, adjusted operating margin in Q1 for Protein Platforms would have been mid single digits. We continue to expect additional improvement in Protein Platforms' profitability with topline growth and productivity gains, drive operating leverage for the remainder of this year and beyond. In summary, Q1 was a great start for the fiscal year for Bio-Techne with solid commercial and operational execution driving record organic growth for the quarter. Looking ahead to the full-year fiscal year 2017, we still expect overall Company organic growth to be similar if not slightly ahead of fiscal year 2016. For those who pay to particular attention to the calendarization of our results, there are a few items to be mindful about our fiscal Q2 that could be different from Q1. First, I'll remind everyone that the purchase of ACD occurred August 1 in Q1. ACD's monthly sales profile is much more weighted to the last half of the quarter versus the beginning, similar to Protein Platforms. Thus, in Q1, Bio-Techne benefited from reporting most of ACD's revenue in our results, but did not record roughly a third of its operating costs. Therefore, the operating costs of ACD occurred in July. Obviously, ACD will be under Bio-Techne's ownership for the entire second quarter. Thus, all of ACD's quarterly operating costs will be included in Bio-Techne's Q2 results and be a larger drag on operating margins than they were in Q1. This also holds true for below the line for interest costs. In Q1, we incurred higher interest expense as a result of the additional line of credit taken to perform the transaction. In Q2, there will be three months of higher interest expense rather than just the two months we incurred in Q1. The second item that could be different in Q2 versus Q1 is OEM delivery time. As both Chuck and I have stated in our previous commentary, the OEM nature of our Diagnostics segment can cause lumpy revenue results for the quarter. This lumpiness was favorable in Q1 but will be less so in Q2. Right now, based on the schedule of OEM shipments, we are expecting Q2 revenues for Diagnostics to be relatively flat to the prior year. And third, you will recall that the British pound took another significant drop in valuation in the first two weeks of October. As you may know, our commercial headquarters for Europe is based in the U.K. and the functional currency is the British pound. Also, approximately 20% of our European revenue is derived from customers in the U.K.. As we are experiencing a negative impact, the transactional effect just as we had in Q4 when the British pound took its first drop in valuation the last week of June. We are also expecting slightly more headwind from translational FX in the second quarter as a result of the devaluation that occurred this month. That all being said, as we stated in our last Q4 earnings call, we still expect our adjusted operating margins to improve in the second half of the fiscal year as ACD's revenue continues to ramp, producing more volume leverage for our biotech segment. That concludes my prepared comments. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Janice to open the lines for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Amanda Murphy of William Blair. Amanda Murphy : Good morning guys. I just had a quick question on the academic markets. Obviously they were quite strong for you guys, and it sounded like, in Europe and the US, that was the case. Others have seen it as a little bit of a different dynamic in this quarter. So have you seen anything at all, any weakness sort of coming into the quarter or maybe the end of the quarter that would suggest that there is something going on in academia? I think a lot of companies have have stated issues in the U.S. in particular. I don't know if it's just because they have more CapEx versus less recurring revenue, but as you guys have added more set of CapEx type platforms, I am wondering if you are seeing anything at all on that side either. Chuck Kummeth : Thanks for the question Amanda. For the quarter, we saw results pretty similar to last quarter, which were also pretty good results. I would say that, for September, things were soft, and there have been a lot of people reporting before us in support of similar things. October, it looks pretty good again now. So I think it's down a little bit, there is a lot of speculation by some of our peers on, is this some of this due its funding et cetera, et cetera. Our results for - we think we must have a little bit of impact because only better for us that there was any real impact on that yet but I assume there is no at this point on increase of 6.5%. Europe had a very strong quarter in academia, and we see it kind of somewhat continuing, albeit Brexit and other news events, whatever happens there could be different. But as it goes right now, it's pretty steady. A lot of it I think is coming from our great execution. Our teams are bigger. We have the SPACE acquisition. We are doing a lot of cross-selling. So, that's also possibly helping a lot. Asia looks pretty much the same. Now, the part which would be funded academia that may be due to therapeutics cell therapeutics, is certainly definitely still in a rut. Everything around that purchase is doing quite fine yes. We even see a potential bottoming in Japan. So things are looking the best they have for us in over a year in Japan, although I wouldn't say it's a victory lap yet or anything. But it certainly is a negativity reflected that is finally waning. And I guess that's kind of initial comments. I guess one more thing - our partnerships with Fisher certainly helps that\u2019s a key strategic area for us for academia and Fisher results are more or less very similar it have been low single digit so, keeping us out of that negative areas years ago. Amanda Murphy : Okay. That makes sense. And then a one quick clarification question on the organic growth. Did you say that you still expect the growth for this year to be in line with last year from an organic perspective or did you say to this quarter? Jim Hippel : For the year, we expect the organic growth to be similar to the rate of growth we had in fiscal year 2016 if not slightly higher. Amanda Murphy : Okay. That was kind of what you had said last quarter, correct? Jim Hippel : Right. Amanda Murphy : Okay. And then just the last one from me on EBIT margin. So recognizing all your comments around the dynamics of ACD in Q2, do you think that -- the EBIT margin this quarter I think came in a bit better than we were all looking for, again realizing that will probably take a step down in the quarter following. So just wanted to check in there, is there anything there that -- is it performing in line with your expectations? And then are you still expecting the full year to be -- I think you said around the mid 30s for the full year. Chuck Kummeth : Excuse me, what market? EBIT\u2026 Amanda Murphy : EBIT market. Jim Hippel : In short Amanda our - we had our fiscal year '17 at the end of Q4 where we have not changed after this quarter. So you're correct that margins will be more negatively impacted in Q2 because the full quarter inclusion of ACD but we need to come back on the second half a bit but overall end up for the year, somewhere in the mid 40s. Amanda Murphy : Okay. Chuck Kummeth : We're going to be - we expect to this acquisition to get really breakeven within the year. We were in great shape as first quarter as Jim pointed out that's because we didn't - we had very little middle of the cost in the first month of quarter, it\u2019s not level. So looking for forward, the growth pace where at that is fantastic rate, so it\u2019s 50% plus and with the 80% plus growth margin business, it should do very well for it and we look forward to the year for now where analysis is annualized. Amanda Murphy : Okay, thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Catherine Ramsey of Robert W. Baird. Catherine Ramsey : Hi guys, thanks for the questions and congrats on a great quarter. I first wanted to dig into that antibody double-digit growth. How much of that is market growth versus you taking share there? And if it is taking share, how much of that do you think is from Santa Cruz? Chuck Kummeth : First, I'll take them in reverse order. Santa Cruz is probably still not impacted because most customers are actually I think ordering as much as they can from Santa Cruz to get ready for the end of the year decision. They are not impacted. They don't release until December going forward. So I don't know if we've seen too much yet. We are certainly out advertising, and we are out certainly trying to solicit as much of that potential growth as we can. I think there has been some just from the fact we are advertising, and out going after being hungry. But Santa Cruz is still in the game, so I think those impacts are probably more next year, we think. The other points I think, we're really strong in Europe antibody. I think we\u2019re about maybe the same here in the U.S. high single digits. I think in Asia we have probably decent, although in China, we are probably little soft to buy these - we talked about. I think it\u2019s probably more about our execution, more custom work, I think operational excellence. I don't think it's - I don't think it thus taking whole lot of surely the market is expanding as well as you think mid to high - lower to high single digit side. So I think we\u2019re hanging in there. We don't have quite the numbers of growth that TTM has so we're probably remember two in rating that range. We look pretty good using - and I think it\u2019s just in a lot of good operational excellence, a lot of good innovation here. We're still generating 100 new products a year. We\u2019re still focused on all types and many species and more of the same. We're certainly in the top five. We think suppliers in the world and we sure like to be even higher. Catherine Ramsey : Okay, great. And then looking at Protein Platforms' continued strength there, how much of that is from biopharma versus academic customers? And then also looking at the margin, a big improvement year-over-year, but, quarter-to-quarter, credit stepped down. Any dynamics to call out there and what we should expect from an operating margin perspective for the rest of the year? Chuck Kummeth : Jim is scrambling for references here, but I was going to think it\u2019s about 50/50 and these confirmed. We're pretty even. I always have liked the Protein Platform business model. It\u2019s very, very balanced and how we really go after the markets both pharma as well as academia and it really has given go one quarter the next, it\u2019s pretty balanced. This was a number going back to the fees system while we bought ProteinSimple. The big thing here looking forward, it wasn't just about biopharma acquisition, we want to be sure that academia was wanted by instruments for something that\u2019s been done, mainly with hand lever western blot and that continues to be the case that we're forging ahead inventing four labs and academic labs that these instruments are worth buying and it\u2019s worth stepping up and stepping up their game in western. Catherine Ramsey : And then the margin commentary? Jim Hippel : The margin commentary? Well, it's not single-digit negative. We are low single-digit positive. I think, as we scale the business dramatically as we're going forward, I think it will happen. We do still think this is a 30% to low 30s% margin business long-term. I think we are still a few quarters away from that. There needs to be more scale. The decision now is to have four major platforms, so it is larger but it is still composed of still relatively small segment businesses in that division. They each have got to get their own critical mass, so to say. We are also a little leveraged more on cost synergies on the commercial side, as we discussed, doing a lot of cross-selling and combining our sales group within the biotech division and CPD that's going to allow us to spend less in commercial on CPD, which is also going to help margins long-term. But it was a good move this quarter, I think, and about where we were focused internally with our plan. So, internally, we are kind of on our plan here. And I think you'll see the growth going forward. The improvements will be kind of in line which you expect for continued accelerate growth. I think remaining at 20% growth results was our goal. We're hoping to always remain mid single teens or so. But at 20% or so going forward, there should be moderate improvements in margin every quarter. That's our plan. You'd expect that 20% is a big move. Catherine Ramsey : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll go the next to Matt Hewitt of Craig-Hallum Capital Group. Matthew Hewitt : Good morning gentlemen. Congratulations on the quarter. I wanted to pick up on one of the comments you made earlier regarding one. I think you just touched on it here briefly as well. As far as combining the sales forces are concerned between the Protein Platforms and the Biotech, when were those changes implemented? How quickly do you anticipate seeing some of the fruits of that integration? Chuck Kummeth : We are seeing some fruits already. They were already beginning to be implemented I would say last quarter, not this quarter. We did, as an example, we did a big sales conference in Barcelona, and we had all our segments people together with roughly 100 people there, and a lot of training sessions during the week, a lot of networking -- understanding each other's customers so they would understand the needs and wished of the one customer to another within these salespeople, because they are all pretty technical. They know enough about each other's areas to be dangerous. So they know when they have customers to work. If we're in reagents area and we\u2019re looking at antibodies, they know they do enough work and what they maybe the need for western blot systems. So that kind of activity was happening. We formalized more and more of it. We've then begin this followed and more of it along the West Coast, headquarter is over CPD and I think you\u2019ll see more of it. Our head of Commercial North America for the biotech area, Gerry Andros has been spending a lot of time working with Andrea who is commercials for CPD and they\u2019re becoming more and more one team. This always was the thesis. This is the subsidiary model, I\u2019m trying to generate here. I think we\u2019re going to continue to buy things and have acquisitions of things to do a line up hardware to reagents and as long as we do there will be synergies. Short answer is you\u2019re seeing some already. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re at the knee of the curve yet at all. I think it will only get better. Matthew Hewitt : Okay, great. Can you just touched on it a little bit there as well. from an M&A perspective, given some of the lumpiness we've seen from some of your peers here this past quarter, has that created any incremental opportunities on the M&A front? Are there specific areas that now maybe are a little more appealing than they were even at your analyst day here not too long ago? Thank you. Chuck Kummeth : We continue to have a strong pipeline and we've officially competed two this quarter. We won\u2019t complete two every quarter, I can assure you. But we\u2019re hunting. We\u2019re in the game on some right now. We will continue to be though far more won\u2019t happen, that will - and will happen that\u2019s the way it goes. In terms of the climate out there, things got cheaper or easier or our peers getting solid on it and staying out of the games because we didn\u2019t have a great quarter, I doubt it. I don\u2019t see any difference in terms of competition for great assets. Great assets out there will always generate great competition. I feel really good about our team, our strategy and hiring ACD. We worked on it about 18 months. We were able to keep as very quiet in private and middle into process. It would have I think that who knows what would happen, but the synergies are obvious and apparent and the team I actually never seen such great synergy between two teams for early but we're really pumped about ACD. I wish we could find more of those. They're out there. We\u2019re hunting and expect a couple of year hopefully right now. Matthew Hewitt : Great, thank you very much. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go next to Carolina Ibanez of Janney Montgomery Scott. Carolina Ibanez : Hello, good morning. I'm filling in for Paul Knight. On your new RNA into the high depreciation, it looks from advance sales diagnostics. Can you provide some comments on your initial commercialization plans and also future gain business some pathologies and biopharma? Chuck Kummeth : Sure. High-level, we are really excited because this is an area -- the work frame we want to go after, ISH, and it's workframe in the laboratory, especially biology work. These pathologists already know our product, they know our brand, they know our company. They want to go after it very similar to like with Western blot process. This company hits that, and it really is a movement from a standard antibody approach to a molecular approach. And we feel that there's a lot to offer with that. We have reagents who work with us already. We're working together with them. It is a business model very similar to our own. It's supporting content in little vials and vials can tip and they're going out to customers. We understand how to do that. We've been doing it for 40 years. The gross margins are wonderful, the whole process of generating a probe for pathologists, so you can go to work with a slide, even with his office, a microscope, is quick. It takes two weeks to generate a probe. We now have over 11,000 probes, so it's a very, very fast-moving business. You talked about commercialization. We now have over 600 publications on this technology. So it's even way ahead of the Western blot technology platform in terms of visibility and awareness within its market. What's the game going to be? It's going to be how fast will pathologists take it up. How fast will they move from pot shooting with antibodies and using their art and their experience and their know-how of particular antibodies to find what they're looking for versus this approach, which is much more specific. We like both, though. I mean we sell antibodies for the irregular approach of validation and you need both really in some degrees because you may find what you're looking for in RNA, but the protein may not have expressed it. You may still be wanting to go back and prove that out with an antibody once you know what you're looking at from an RNA point of view. So, all these are commercially being driven right now. We have a pretty extensive sales force with them, which is one reason, even at high gross margins, even by the business they are why they are not breakeven yet officially. It's because they do have a complete commercial model in place. Over time, we'll be aligning that with our own commercial organizations which operate synergies. But at the end of the day, it is heavier commercial model than selling proteins. You actually need technical salespeople working in the field with the pathologists, and that's the mission. It's a large, large market, well over $1 billion, some say as much as a $2 billion market. And then the gravy on top of all this is that you can use the same approach, the same technology, as a companion diagnostic, and that's what like a lots. And this is a technology diagnostic that everybody's platform out there, Ventana. So we expect, if you take out along all of these positions, all these different instrument that our primary partner right now for a full solution for the pathologist with all the automation is like that. And that's the commercial sense right now. And at 50-plus% growth, in a way, we're just kind of staying out of their way. Carolina Ibanez : Good, thank you. And then you also mentioned the integration in Japan continues to lag, but then that it looked like maybe Europe. Did I hear correctly? If that's the case, what is driving the change there? Chuck Kummeth : You know, we've been saying for a few quarters, all of us in this industry, that pretty soon they should be running out of stuff. It's been shrinking for a couple of years. We've been waiting on their funding to be released as they integrated their funding organizations to the one they called AMED. We have been told that the funding is released, but we are not seeing a whole lot of it because, last quarter, this previous quarter, or this quarter starting out, things are looking better, and we are hoping it's bottoming. But we are not claiming victory yet. It's still very tentative in Japan. But we have focused on it. We are not that large there. I mean we have people on the ground there and we are actually focused on trying to work with our distributors and be more heavily promotional, and all the typical things you do to try and spur business. More to come, hopefully, next quarter, we can tell you some positive information on Japan. But I haven't heard anything yet out of anybody, mystery, our peers and I doubt I will this quarter, but maybe next quarter we all know. Carolina Ibanez : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And with no further questions at this time, I'd like to turn the conference back over for any additional or closing remarks. Chuck Kummeth : Okay. It was a great quarter. It was better than our last quarter and just being a slightly above 10% organic growth, so we remain committed to focusing on growth and focusing on our margins, and investing correctly and wisely. And we think we are doing a good job here, but our customers in the end tell whether we are not. We're focused on them as well. So thank you all for tuning in and we\u2019ll talk to you next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your participation. That does conclude today\u2019s conference. You may now disconnect.",

Analysts: Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Puneet Souda - Leerink Partners LLC Katherine Schoen - Robert W. Baird Aurko Joshi - William Blair & Co. LLC Charles Edward Haff - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC Carolina Ibanez-Ventoso - Janney Montgomery Scott Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Bio-Techne Earnings Conference Call for the Second Quarter of Fiscal Year 2017. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the call will be opened for questions following management's prepared remarks. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jim Hippel, Bio-Techne's Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir. James T. Hippel - Bio-Techne Corp.: Thank you and good morning. Thanks for joining us this morning. On the call with me is Chuck Kummeth, our Chief Executive Officer for Bio-Techne. Before we begin, let me briefly cover our Safe Harbor statement. Some of the comments made during this conference call may be considered forward-looking statements, including beliefs and expectations about the company's future results. The company's 10-K for fiscal year 2016 identifies certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements made during this call. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of any new information or future events or developments. The 10-K as well as the company's other SEC filings are available on the company's website within its Investor Relations section. During the call, non-GAAP financial measures may be used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. Tables reconciling these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available in the company's press release issued earlier this morning on the Bio-Techne Corporation website at www.bio-techne.com. With that, I'll turn the call over to Chuck. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter conference call. I'm happy to report that we are tracking to our fiscal 2017 performance goals. The company delivered 2% organic growth in the second quarter and so far has delivered 6% organic growth year-to-date. Our second quarter results were negatively impacted by the timing of OEM shipments within our Diagnostics division. Year-to-date, this division has grown 5%, and has growth and spread evenly throughout the first two quarters, Bio-Techne reporting 4% organic growth in Q2. Looking at our performance by our major regions and end markets, I would sum it as follows. Consistent with prior quarters, Europe and APAC continued to perform very well, while China continued to experience shipment delays to immuno-cell therapy customers as the local CFDA continues to work through regulations pertinent of the Baidu scandal in the country. Meanwhile, the US saw a bit of a slowdown with biopharma's growth cooling. Now some details on each of the regions. In Europe, high-single-digit growth was broad-based throughout the region but was focused on the biopharma end markets. The research activity cycle with our biopharma customers has been high for a number of quarters now and we are positioned to benefit by supplying them the top-quality reagents and innovative instruments that make their experiments successful and productive. To capture more of the growth opportunities in Europe, we continue to expand our geographical penetration by converting distribution to a direct sales model, just as we did with the acquisition of Space in Italy which gave us a direct sales model in Southern Europe. In the second half of fiscal 2017, we'll be looking to expand our direct sales model in Iberia and parts of Eastern Europe. As with Europe, many of the themes we saw in the Asia region for the past several quarters continued in the second quarter. In China, our Western reagent brands continued to grow well north of 20% in Q2 and our instruments grew north of 15%. However, a major exception continues to be our PrimeGene brand, which is heavily impacted by the CFDA crackdown and cell therapies administered by hospitals due to the Baidu scandal earlier this year. PrimeGene is a key supplier of reagents to hospitals who use these therapies and is our go-to brand in our China-for-China strategy. We understand that the CFDA is making progress on these regulations for hospitals using cell therapies, which will stimulate growth in this treatment again, and PrimeGene is well-positioned to fully participate in this growth given its GMP quality, but we probably have a couple more tough quarters ahead before the regulation process is complete and the therapies resume as they did before the scandal. As for the rest of APAC, overall, the region continued to perform well. We experienced double-digit growth in Korea for our reagents with our instrument placements throughout the region overall. Japan growth was flat, the first quarter in many years that had a decline. So it appears they've reached the bottom there and we'll be looking for modest growth going forward. The biggest change in the market we saw in Q2 compared to the past several quarters was a slowdown in growth we experienced in the US markets, especially in the biopharma end markets. Interestingly, our order activity was actually strong, but the average size of the orders was down. The reasons for lower order sizes varied from customer to customer, but the major theme centered around timing of various research projects. We continue to monitor this end market carefully, but have no reason at this point to believe there is a longer-term shift from research activity by our biopharma customers. Now, for a little color on our Q2 performance by division. The Biotech division grew 2% organically in the second quarter, with proteins growing in the low-single-digits, while antibodies and assays grew in the mid-single-digits. Growth in antibodies was led by our Novus brand, where our digital marketing campaigns and continued enhancements to our website continued to pay off. Our growth in assays for the quarter was driven by our Luminex products, where we now offer the instrument as well as the consumables, a total customer solution package that is also paying dividends in terms of growth and in royalties for the content we provide for these assays sold by other providers. Offsetting some of the growth from our three main product categories already mentioned was the headwinds we faced with our PrimeGene brand in China, which I've already discussed, as well as a decrease in the large custom projects by our biopharma customers in the U.S. As I mentioned in my regional commentary, we believe this pause in large purchases by our biopharma customers in the U.S. to be temporary, but it's something we are monitoring closely. Also part of the Biotech segment and our newest business unit as a result of the acquisition we made last August, Advanced Cell Diagnostics continued in Q2 with a fantastic growth of over 50% on a standalone basis. As a reminder, ACD marks Bio-Techne's entry into the genomics field and market. Second, and more importantly, its innovative and versatile technology has the potential to change traditional pathology practices. RNA in-situ hybridization is a transformative technology facilitating and improving the monitoring of gene expression patterns at the single-cell level, while retaining the morphological context of the tissue being analyzed. ACD's technology serves both research and diagnostic markets, expanding Bio-Techne's presence in the clinical lab setting. Each and every day, we become more enthusiastic about the opportunities that lie ahead for this business unit and the great team we have in Newark, California to seize them. Moving on to Protein Platforms. This division also continued with its growth momentum, marking its fourth quarter in a row of double-digit organic growth. Our newest iCE instrument, Maurice, continues to be well received by our customers, leading the biologics product line to strong double-digit growth. Simple Plex, our automated multi-ELISA platform, also continued to win new customers. Meanwhile, existing Simple Plex customers increased their usage of the instrument, which resulted in a 50% increase in revenue from cartridges used in this platform. Finally, the Simple Western product line, led by the Wes instrument, continues to be adopted as the new standard for the way Western blots are done in the lab. In Q2, we saw a strong double-digit growth in instrument placements with a record 72 Wes sold during the quarter, making a total of over 600 Wes now in the field. Finally, our Diagnostics division reported revenue in the quarter that was lower than last year. As we've discussed many times before, this division is the lumpiest of our businesses due to delivery patterns of Trillium (7:28) Diagnostics customers. This has been especially true since our acquisition of Cliniqa over a-year-and-a-half ago. This business develops controls and assays with shelf life much longer than other product lines within the Diagnostics division. Over the long-term, we expect this business to be solid mid-single-digit grower. To give some further evidence of that, the shorter shelf life product lines within the division did achieve mid-single-digit growth in Q2. Also, you may recall that Q1 was very strong for the division with nearly 20% growth. When you average the two quarters together, year-to-date growth was over 5%, right in line with its historic trajectory. The long-term project pipeline for our Diagnostics division remains very strong and we believe this will allow it to maintain at least mid-single-digit growth trajectory for years to come. As we've increased our picks and shovels capability in serving our Diagnostics customers over the past several years, in the second quarter we dipped our toe deeper into the Diagnostics market with an investment we made in Astute Medical, Incorporated, a diagnostics company devoted to improving patient healthcare outcome through the identification and validation of novel biomarkers. Astute Medical has launched a diagnostic assay for acute kidney injury using key biomarkers and other products from Bio-Techne's large menu of reagents, with a strong pipeline of additional diagnostic solutions under development. This transaction allows Astute access to our reagents for further assay development, while providing Bio-Techne an ongoing revenue stream, based on this assay's success in the Diagnostics end market. We are very excited about the strategic partnership we have with Astute Medical and believe this investment will give Bio-Techne an avenue to yet another market where the company can leverage its large portfolio of reagents and accelerate revenue in years to come. In closing, we finished the first half of fiscal 2017 in a trajectory that is in line with our long-term financial goals. These goals include achieving annual growth of mid-single digits in our Biotech division, at least mid-single-digit growth in our Diagnostics division and double-digit growth in our Protein Platforms division. These growth rates, together with ACD's strong double-digit growth, will propel Bio-Techne forward as a leader in the life science tools space. We just finished a refresh of the company's five-year strategic plan, a process we go through every year with our executive team and our board of directors to fine-tune our strategies and ensure that they are still the right ones to provide strong returns for our shareholders and other stakeholders for years to come. I am pleased to report that although there were no major changes to our key strategies that we have been pursuing over the past several years, we are more energized by the opportunities ahead of us in each of our businesses, as we continue to build out our own life sciences business portfolio. With that, I will turn the call over to Jim who will provide more details on our financial performance for the quarter. James T. Hippel - Bio-Techne Corp.: Thanks, Chuck. I will provide an overview of our Q2 financial performance for the total company and then provide some color on each of our three segments. Starting with the overall second quarter financial performance, adjusted EPS decreased 8% to $0.81. The impact of foreign exchange fluctuations represented a headwind to EPS of approximately $0.03. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.17, compared to $0.69 in the prior year. The biggest driver for the lower GAAP earnings are non-cash purchase accounting costs and contingent consideration revaluation associated with recent acquisitions. Q2 revenue reported was $131.8 million, an increase of 9% year-over-year, with organic revenue increasing 2%. Second quarter reported sales include the 9% growth contribution from acquisitions, partially offset by a 2% unfavorable foreign exchange headwind. By geography, the U.S. grew low-single digits, with growth comparable in both biopharma and academia. Europe grew in the high-single digits, with biopharma sales growth in the mid-teens and low-single-digit growth in academia. China's organic growth was in the mid-single digits in the second quarter, with double-digit growth in our Western brand, being offset by the impact of the Baidu scandal on our local China-for-China PrimeGene brand. After many quarters of decline, Japan appears to have bottomed out in Q2 with flat organic growth. Excluding Japan and China, the rest of APAC grew in the mid-teens organically in the second quarter. Note that all references made to growth rate by region and end markets exclude our OEM sales, which mostly occur in our Diagnostics segment. Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin was an even 71% in Q2, increasing approximately 20 basis points from the prior year due to favorable mix. Foreign exchange had a nominal impact on adjusted gross margins year-over-year. Adjusted SG&A in Q2 was 25.7% of revenue, 335 basis points higher than last year. The SG&A increase was driven by the acquisition made since the beginning of the fiscal year and strategic investments made in our core businesses to support growth. R&D expense in Q2 was 10.1% of revenue, 100 basis points higher than last year, mostly due to the acquisition of ACD in Q1. The resulting adjusted operating margin for Q2 was 35.2%., a decrease of approximately 420 basis points from the prior-year period. Recent acquisitions contributed 340 basis points of decrease, with the remainder largely attributable to strategic investments made throughput the past year. Looking at our numbers below operating income, net interest expense in Q2 was $1.7 million, compared to $0.4 million of net interest expense last year. The higher interest expense was due to a $400 million line of credit which was opened in Q1 to replace our previous $150 million line of credit as well as fund the acquisition of ACD last August. Other non-operating expense for the quarter was $0.9 million, compared to $0.3 million in the prior-year quarter, with unfavorable transactional FX in the current quarter driving the variance. Our adjusted effective tax rate in Q1 was 30.6%, an increase of 50 basis points from the second quarter of last year due to a greater percentage of taxable income being generated in the U.S. In terms of return on capital, we continue to pay our dividend and paid out $11.9 million in the quarter. Average diluted shares were up less than 1% over the year-ago period at 37.5 million shares outstanding. Turning to cash flow on the balance sheet. $41.6 million of cash was generated from operations in the second quarter and our investment in capital expenditures was $2.9 million. We ended the quarter with $115.5 million of cash and short-term available-for-sale investments. And our long-term debt obligations at the end of Q2 stood at $343.7 million, relatively flat from the end of Q1. Going forward, our capital deployment priorities remain opportunistic M&A, our dividend and paying down the debt. Now, I'll discuss the performance of our three business segments, starting with the Biotechnology segment. Q2 reported sales were $86 million, with reported revenue increasing 13%. Acquisitions contributed 13% to revenue growth. Foreign exchange negatively impacted growth by 2% and organic growth was 2%. Organic growth was broad-based in all major product lines, but partially offset by lower PrimeGene revenue in China and timing of larger biopharma custom projects in the U.S. Adjusted operating income for the Biotech segment decreased 1% in Q2 compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 45.9%, a decrease of 600 basis points year-over-year, due entirely to the ACD acquisition. Excluding the ACD acquisition, adjusted operating margins were essentially flat to the prior year. Turning now to the Diagnostics segment. Reported revenue in Q2 was $24.3 million, which reported an organic growth decreasing 5% from the prior year. Solid growth in blood- and glucose-based controls was more than offset by the timing of OEM shipments from the diagnostic assay and reagent product line. Due to the fluctuations of OEM ordering patterns from quarter-to-quarter, management also monitors trailing 12-month revenue growth to smooth out these timing impacts. For the end of Q2, TTM revenue growth for the Diagnostics segment was 12%. Diagnostics segment adjusted operating income decreased 21% in Q2 and adjusted operating margin was 23.8%, a decrease of 460 basis points from the prior year. The lower adjusted operating margin was primarily attributable to lower sales volume. Moving on to our Protein Platforms segment. Net sales in Q2 were $21.5 million, an organic increase of 12% from the prior-year period, with recent acquisitions contributing 1% to growth and unfavorable currency translation impacting revenue by approximately 2%. Growth for this segment was broad-based in most major regions and product lines, with particular contribution from our biologics product line. Adjusted operating income in Q2 for the Protein Platforms segment was $1.8 million, representing adjusted operating margin of 8.6%, an increase of 70 basis points from the prior year. Strong volume leverage drove the year-over-year improvement, partially offset by the operating costs associated with the Zephyrus acquisition and unfavorable FX. In summary, we had solid revenue execution across all of our businesses and managed our cost to reflect the timing realities we faced with our OEM customers in Diagnostics and with our larger biopharma customers in the U.S. We ended the first half of our fiscal year 2017 on a trajectory we expected with year-to-date organic growth of 6% and year-to-date adjusted operating margin at approximately 35%. Looking ahead to the full-year fiscal year 2017, we still expect overall company organic growth to be similar to fiscal year 2016. For those who pay particular attention to the calendarization of our results, we do expect Q3 to be similar to Q2 with regards to organic growth and profitability for both our Protein Platforms and Diagnostics divisions. For the Biotech division, we expect improved organic growth in Q3 versus Q2, assuming biopharma research spend picks up in the U.S. We also expect overall adjusted operating margin to improve due to a larger mix of revenue coming from the Biotech division. That concludes my prepared comments. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Amelia to open the line for some questions. Operator : Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Dan Leonard from Deutsche Bank. Sir, your line is open. Please go ahead. Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank : Thank you. I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit more on what you call the cooling in biopharma. Was it broad-based? Were there a couple \u2013 it sounds like you might be flagging a couple of specific projects, but anything further you could offer would be helpful. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: I think it's a combination of two things. One is, we definitely have some timing issues on some projects, some bigger things, affecting our numbers as we thought. Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank : Sure. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: The second thing is, we talked about our lower order sizes. Usually, we don't see them go down. In fact we usually see (19:01), call it, the usually end-of-year budget flush or whatever. But we didn't see that end-of-year budget spending that we usually see, and orders going down is something very atypical. And it was broad-based, so it's definitely something kind of marketing in the market more or less, so. We've done a very detailed thorough analysis of all our key accounts and bio (19:22) in particular, and we can definitely point to a lot of project timing, so knock on wood. Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank : Okay. And then the improvement you're expecting in biopharma in Q3 and then presumably in Q4 as well, can you \u2013 like, how much of a bounce-back are you really expecting and do you have any leading indicators which would support that? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: No. I think it'll happen when it happens. We talked about the same thing a couple of years ago with Germany, if you remember, and we had a similar kind of situation and it bounced back very strong. It's been strong ever since. I will point out too, you'll notice our numbers were a good solid mid-single-digit growth in our antibodies and decent numbers in our proteins, a little bit lower due to things we just talked about. But a lot of projects are worked around our ELISA kits. Our ELISA kits are a little bit off and that's one of the bigger reasons where you can speak of project timing. Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank : Okay. Thank you. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: So they're a little more lumpier than the run rate buying of antibodies and proteins, so it's more evident. Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank : Okay. Thanks, Chuck. Operator : Okay. And we'll take our next question from Puneet Souda from Leerink Partners. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Puneet Souda - Leerink Partners LLC : Yeah. Hi, Chuck, Jim. Thanks for taking my question. Just, overall, if you could elaborate a bit on the PrimeGene situation? How long do you think that will take to turn around? What's the regulatory requirements? Could you educate us a little bit there? It seems like a number of other players have benefited from this, given their regulatory products that they already had approved in the market, but seems to be hurting you a little bit. So, just educate us a little bit when this can recover back. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Yeah. In terms of companies like us in China, we're pretty narrow compared to most, right? We don't have much in the instrument business growing there. It's very small. We're just getting off the ground there with all that, getting off the ground with ACD. So we're left to our reagents, our core business, which is seeing a 20-plus percent growth going on for a year or two years now. PrimeGene, as you know, we bought as an asset with our China-for-China strategy with a brand outside of R&D Systems. We do sell R&D Systems brand into this segment as well, but to the large degree mostly it's hospitals, it's clinical setting in China, which do a lot of their own research and sell a lot of their own therapies, okay, buy from PrimeGene, they buy locally. And there are other local competitors other than us that also would be seeing this (21:55) but there's nothing public, nothing you would really see. So, that's kind of gist of it. We're probably two quarters in with two quarters to go. It's definitely material to PrimeGene and it's big enough where it affects our numbers overall for China. We still had growth, but without that if you go back and normalize what we are doing with PrimeGene, in some cases a couple of years ago growing as much as 50% in growth. You'll see a much different situation at this point right now for our overall numbers. So it will come back. We'll wait and watch and we'll see where we're at and we'll see checking in hospital-by-hospital, which are lots of and which we're doing. And some of them are getting their certification. Clearly, people are looking for and there's demand for these solutions, and so there's pressure I think to get things done. It won't be like the other crackdowns they've done that are a little longer-term in China. So we're expecting another two quarters or so in which we hope you'll see kind of back to normal. And we're expecting a 20%-plus growth again with PrimeGene and, obviously, a year from now a couple of easy comps. Puneet Souda - Leerink Partners LLC : Got it. Okay. Thanks for that. And just on the Diagnostics segment, one quick one on that. Just trying to understand, as you've done work with Astute and as you're trying to grow further into that segment, help us understand a little bit the regulatory risk and the reimbursement risk and how you're thinking about those? It seems to me that strategy-wise you're thinking a little bit more aggressively in the Diagnostics segment. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Well, the strategy is simple dealing with the risk, we're not doing it, they are, so. They're our strategic partner and they've done it before. This is the team that was the core of Biosite (23:39) years ago. So they've done this before. They've created the hockey-stick growth that we're predicting with this company. They have screened hundreds of our reagents. They've worked with us for actually a long time. They've been a really good customer for a few years now. And so we just got very close, and given what we want to do with immunotherapeutics and with our reagents and our global strategy, it just made sense to get closer. They found success. They are buying multiple reagents from us that have turned into biomarkers, but there's IP around and it's a big issue. I mean, acute kidney injury is a massive problem for cost in the U.S. and we haven't looked outside yet. And it's already approved. And so it's selling and ramping quickly. And then we're not talking yet about what's left in the pipeline. They're busy already on new things that they've found in our freezers and we have other indications coming out over the coming years. So we hope this is a great foray for us to get in a profitable area of diagnostics, not the low-end side of things, where there are good reimbursements well-covered under the DRG and we expect the new things that we do will be out as well. And then we'll hopefully go outside the U.S. at some point as well. But it's actually very good. And again, we're really leaning on their regulatory experience, their clinical and their overall cash position to drive this, which we think is very strong, so. Puneet Souda - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay, guys. Thanks so much for the questions. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Katherine Schoen from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. Katherine Schoen - Robert W. Baird: Hey, guys. Thanks for the questions. Curious how the quarter came in relative to your expectations as you kind of look segment-by-segment. Was there a big surprise there or was it pretty much in line with what you guys have been thinking? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Well, it's certainly a little more disappointing than we'd like. That's why you see us making all the comments. Well, if we normalize Diagnostics that's forever lumpy and 20% quarter last quarter which put us over 10% organic growth, well, it's 5% to 6% grower. So, if we put that in and say it was a level run rate business, which is not, where it would be at? It'd only be a mid-single-digit growth as a company, kind of where we need to be as a minimum. I think some of the softness in biopharma due to the timing and mainly due to projects around ELISA kits in particular, it was unfortunate. It will bounce back. I think we're okay there. Antibodies, I mean, I'd be more worried if we saw antibodies crumbling or something. But antibodies are strong, stronger than ever. We're doing great. So the website is working. We're growing in every region. And then also Europe, Europe is just kind of steady as she go. It's been as good as last quarter and we see better looking forward and with an acceleration in our instrument businesses, which are getting bigger and bigger and getting more critical mass over in these areas where we've staffed up a little bit, we have some great leadership now in Europe around Protein Platforms division and doing the same now in Asia. And then lastly, Japan, I mean, it's been over two years since I can tell you we were at a flat in Japan. We've been negative and strong negatives. So we're hoping that's coming back strong. So, overall, a kind of a mix bag. Would have likely seen a 4%, 5% overall net, but we didn't get that. But I think, as Jim commented on earlier, year-to-date we're right where we said we'd be, as we were so strong last quarter and maybe that's still a little bit in this quarter, we had some of that. But we probably said that this year we hope to end somewhat a little bit better than last year and that we're on our thesis, so. So, again, lastly I'll say is we're not in a quarter-to-quarter gain here. We've made massive changes in this company. We have more than doubled in head count. We have almost doubled in size. We're quadrupled in sites globally. That's a lot of change. And it's change you're not going to see in any one or two year, we're investing for the long-term. And if you're in this for a five-year ride with us or so, you're going to see the results coming and coming and coming. And then don't forget, it's just August. It's just five, six months away. We had a 50% grower and which would add 2 full points of organic growth. ACD is doing absolutely fantastic for us. And hopefully, a year after or two years after that, we'll see Astute coming online. If things keep going the way they do with the contracts we have in place, we'll be able to capitalize on that arrangement. So, any way, it's not a one quarter gain and we're okay. Katherine Schoen - Robert W. Baird: Yes. That makes sense. And then one follow-up. For academic customers here in the U.S., low-single digit seems about in line with what you guys usually do. Have you seen any changes in spending or sentiment since the election, or does it seem like it's still business as usual? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: It's kind of business as usual. I would say there's a little bit of a softness (28:35) on biopharma for the end of the year. We'll call it Trump policy, I guess, whatever. But for the most part, I mean, we expected maybe a little worse there. It's kind of steady as she goes. I attribute that to really our strong teams. We've got a great commercial engine going out. The website is really good. Fisher had a better quarter than the previous one. So those all play to, I think, a better ending on the academic side. Katherine Schoen - Robert W. Baird: Great. Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Amanda Murphy from William Blair. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Aurko Joshi - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. It's Aurko in for Amanda. Just a quick follow-up question on ACD. Now that you're about two quarters in, you certainly are happy with it. I guess what are some of the things that you would think need to improve? And how do you expect the table of dilution to look over the next couple of quarters? And the second question is, can you walk us through a bit more on how pricing pressure for growth (29:31) would impact your business? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Well, the first question, and you're not coming in real clear, but I'm hearing you asked about ACD, if we see things that we can improve or the dilution going forward? Aurko Joshi - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yes, both of those. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Well, I think we have an earn-out with them and it goes this calendar year. And at over 50% growth, our strategy in the short term is to stay out of their way. They're doing fantastic. We are working on commercially working together both in Asia as well as Europe. The teams are getting closer to starting a cross-sell, starting to do things that are really a no risk to the earn-out potential fee. But for the most part, they're doing great. They actually were ahead of plan on top and bottom line this quarter. And we're involved, obviously, since we bought them. But we're commercially trying to stay out of their way more or less in terms of how they want to run their business for the next project (30:29) while they're working on their earn-out. On the dilution now, I'll pass it off to Jim here. James T. Hippel - Bio-Techne Corp.: Yeah. Well, I'd say on the dilution aspect of it is that we would expect kind of same level of dilution at least in the near-term that we saw most recently this quarter. But as we start to close out the fiscal year, that dilution will become less and less, and we believe in fiscal year 2018 that we still have a trajectory to be profitable. You got to keep in mind that despite \u2013 with their fast growth, where some of that new growth is coming from now is in the diagnostics space. Up until now they've been really focused on the research-only. But with them now expanding that market in the diagnostic pathology, we continue to invest in the commercial resources to capture that market. Aurko Joshi - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: And remember, those solutions that are already approved and right done (31:14), they're moving forward and selling. It's going very, very well, so. I also mentioned the publication count for ACD technology, this RNA in-situ hybridization, is now well over 600. It's screening. So the adoption pickup, which is something you want to watch, and this is so far looking very, very favorable. So the open question is, how long can they last at 50% growth and we're thinking for many, many quarters yet. So, that's the goal. Aurko Joshi - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. And then the other question, which is a quick follow-up from an earlier comment, is how would you talk about how pricing pressure would impact your business in the drug space? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Well, we're pretty far down the food chain in terms of pricing on drugs. I guess, overall, I'm pretty hopeful. I think this administration I think is going to be the right thing hopefully. And I think corporate tax rates and tax holidays and things that are going to help overall, investment and spending I think, all of the things that everyone else kind of believes I think in our industry. So I don't foresee any real reaction or issue with us in terms of drug pricing. We're very much still heavily on the research side as a company. Aurko Joshi - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Matt Hewitt of Craig-Hallum Capital Group. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Charles Edward Haff - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC : Hi. This is Charlie on for Matt. Thanks for taking our questions. First, can you discuss how the cross-selling efforts are going? We talked a lot about it last quarter. I don't know if we talked about it too much here. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Yeah. I think it's still going to be lopsided more towards instruments and a little towards consumables. It just so happens that you have highly trained professionals selling assays, consumables, so that maybe Masters or Ph.D. people, they know a lot how the solutions work, how to use the instruments, so they really can hand-off leads that will actually work. It isn't quite the same in this side when you've got FAS as your instrument experts that I think it's in the field (33:20) understanding a lot about assays and the reagents. So it's a little bit lopsided. That's why you really focus on this. I think it's still early. But we're seeing really good benefits, especially in Europe. I think some of the strong results in Europe is coming from just exactly that. The teams are smaller and more closer together, in some cases sharing in leadership. And it's working quite well. So we're not, like, trying to merge divisions like within like a Danaher or (33:44) company. This is still a pretty little company. We're not talking large teams. We have probably 150 or so people globally commercially now, about 50 or so in Europe, less than that in U.S. because of the Fisher situation. And it's not hard to get them working together and playing together. So I'm very bullish on it actually. I think we have yet to see big benefits in Asia. I think that's still coming. And as we build out teams in more and more cities in China, we build out the assets there, it's going to be really good. And I wouldn't even count ACD out of that. There's going to be a lot of ACD to come too in the coming years, so. Charles Edward Haff - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC : Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. And then the 21st Century Cures Act, are we seeing any dollars starting to flow out of that or is that still kind of in the works? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: I hear it's still in the works, so. I would say we've not seen anything yet. Charles Edward Haff - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC : Okay. Thank you. That's it for me. Operator : And we'll take our final question from Paul Knight with Janney Montgomery Scott. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Carolina Ibanez-Ventoso - Janney Montgomery Scott : Hello. Good morning. This is actually Carolina Ibanez-Ventoso on for Paul Knight. I was wondering if you could be a little bit more specific on the initial activities that can be attributed to the outstanding performance of ACD. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: The performance of ACD but what kind of performance? Carolina Ibanez-Ventoso - Janney Montgomery Scott : The initial activities in this franchise that has led to the outstanding performance of them. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Okay. As I mentioned earlier, 600 publications is an awful lot for a young technology company. It's really growing. It's virtually a little bit everywhere. It's in a lot of clinical settings as well. There is a research side as well as a diagnostics side, right? And so with like all signed up and selling solutions, that leverages their large sales force. This group also has a fairly decent size sales force, 20 reps, 30 reps, in that range, and we're just starting to build it out in Europe, as I mentioned. So there is a commercial model to this where, even though it's a reagent type of solution, it won't get to the 50-plus-percent op margins we see with our protein business because there is commercial sales that are needed. You need to sell the solutions. It is all about the take-up of pathologists moving from an IHC solution to just more of a genomic version, okay? And it's going really well. So we test it. We talk about it. We're measuring. And what is that to addressable market? We think it's a $1 billion-plus. There is a lot of pathology out there. The take-up is pretty fast and the results are outstanding. Another thing I'll let you know is there's a lot of smaller labs, a lot of places doing IHC, and doctors and pathologists, and they're adding a leverage and outsource a lot of the current research or the experiments or the tests that they want done. They may, in many cases, be waiting a week or two weeks for results. That's without automation. With automation, it could be even worse. This is a solution that works on current automation. You get the results very quickly. You as a pathologist can even work on a scope, on a slide in your office, and get results. It works that well. So, that is also helping pick things real quickly. There's a lot of adoption because it's just based after solutions that are very accurate. And there is roughly 30% of all I would say IHC solutions are missing the antibodies they need to be fully specific. So you don't know for sure what you're finding, what you're looking for. Carolina Ibanez-Ventoso - Janney Montgomery Scott : Yeah. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: So there's just this gap in the antibody portfolio that fills in, at least we're starting, right, a good 30% of gas still is (37:22) part of the market. Carolina Ibanez-Ventoso - Janney Montgomery Scott : Okay. Thanks. That was helpful. And could you also elaborate more on your partnership with Astute Medical? They have NephroCheck, which is already a commercial product, but what additional products do they have under development and which are some areas that they are focused on? Just curious on that. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: There's a second solution that's very closely tied to the NephroCheck, it's called Nephroclear which is in clinical right now. But it's working. We're looking at different solutions for different, I guess, reagents we have. We have a pipeline we can't talk about. Carolina Ibanez-Ventoso - Janney Montgomery Scott : Okay. I understand. Thank you. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: There's more than one. There's at least two we're looking at right now. Carolina Ibanez-Ventoso - Janney Montgomery Scott : Thank you. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: And I should point out too that it took \u2013 it was 150-plus different reagent screenings that this team, which is really good at this stuff and done it before, that they found what they are looking for with really good specificity. Carolina Ibanez-Ventoso - Janney Montgomery Scott : Great. Operator : And with no further questions in the queue, I'd like to turn it back over to Mr. Kummeth for any additional or closing remarks. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: All right. Well, thanks everyone for attending. And definitely we're on our path this year, and we look forward to next quarter and with even hopefully terrific results. So, talk to you then. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for your participation and have a wonderful day.",

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the call will be opened for questions following management's prepared remarks. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jim Hippel, Bio-Techne's Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir. James T. Hippel - Bio-Techne Corp.: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me this morning is Chuck Kummeth, Chief Executive Officer of Bio-Techne. Before we begin, let me briefly cover our Safe Harbor statement. Some of the comments made during this conference call may be considered forward-looking statements, including beliefs and expectations about the company's future results. The company's 10-K for fiscal year 2016 identifies certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements made during this call. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of any new information or future events or developments. The 10-K as well as the company's other SEC filings are available on the company's website within its Investor Relations section. During the call, non-GAAP financial measures may be used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. Tables reconciling these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available in the company's press release issued earlier this morning on the Bio-Techne Corporation website at www.bio-techne.com. Now, I'll turn the call over to Chuck. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter conference call. The company delivered 4 % organic growth in the third quarter and we have many highlights to discuss beyond this headline number that speak to the progress of our long term growth strategy. Let me remind you that our company provides tools to two distinct life science markets. The first and currently the largest market for our portfolio is the life science research market with customers in both academia and biopharma. The majority of our products at service market are for research use only, but some products also support bioproduction at large pharma. The products within our Biotech division and Protein Platform divisions serve this market. The second life science market our company provides tools for is the diagnostic market. Not at the patient level, at least not yet, but to the OEM customers that supply diagnostic instruments and kits to doctors' offices and central labs that provide this service for patients. The picks and shovels types tools we provide include the controls and calibrators for these instruments as well as reagents and assays for the kits. Our long term growth plan for this part of our business are aligned with future diagnostic platforms and kits that are OEM customers are developing, and the pipeline for these new platforms is strong for years into the future. But the short-term demand depends on the inventory management pattern of our OEM customers who buy our products in bulk for efficiency. I'll remind you that these two different business models provide more clarity on the underlying strength of our performance and traction towards achieving our longer term strategic growth initiatives that we shared at our Investor Day last September. In Q3, the two divisions that sell into the life science research market collectively grew 9% organically. Our Biotech division grew 6% organically, while our Protein Platforms division grew 20% organically. And although we can't count it as organic growth until the acquisition annualizes in August, ACD grew nearly 60% in Q3 on a standalone basis. Our strong performance for the quarter was broad-based by region and end market. Europe's results were outstanding with organic growth over 20%. We experienced continued strength in our bio-pharma end markets there but academia also formed very well with organic growth in the high-single digits. There is little doubt that we are executing extremely well in Europe. Our subsidiary model is the most advanced there with the divisional commercial teams working together to consult with customers and provide the right solution to fit their needs, whether in the form of an instrument or a reagent. This creates revenue synergies across our portfolio and clearly is at least part of what is driving our success in Europe. Other factors we believe are contributing to our success there including our continued investment in expanding our direct model which gives us more intimacy with our customers. And our focus on building relationships with the smaller Biotech firms, which are the fastest growing part of biopharma in Europe right now. Our strategies in Europe had been building in momentum over the past year and the result speaks for itself. As in Europe, our Asia region also performed very well. In China, growth for our Western brands approached 30% in Q3. The CFDA crackdown and cell therapies administered by hospitals due to the Baidu scandal one year ago continues to be a drag on our locally produced PrimeGene brand in China results overall. We probably have another quarter or two of headwind here. But for most of fiscal year 2018, the worst will be behind us and we should see gradual contribution again from this part of the China market as the CFDA gradually gets through its certifications. As for the rest of APAC, the overall region continues to perform well. We experienced double digit growth in Korea in our reagents with our instruments placements throughout the region overall. And for the first time in many years, we experienced growth in Japan this quarter. As we said last quarter, a period we've reached the bottom there and we'll be looking for modest growth going forward. Continuing the theme from last quarter, the U.S. is the one region that under perform compared to our expectations at the beginning of our fiscal year, with low single digit growth in both its biopharma and academia end markets. There is little doubt in our minds that the political headlines and rhetoric over the past six months had caused some pause in the pace of funding the life science research project, whether it's a tweet on lowering drug prices or a tweet on reducing NIH funding, this would logically impact researcher decisions on when or which project to pursue until there is more clarity on the regulatory and funding environment. Overtime, calmer heads usually prevail and we believe this period of uncertainty will pass, and the importance of life science research in America will continue for many years to come. Our U.S. business had a particularly strong March and it appears congressional leaders have just reached a tentative budget agreement for the remainder of the government's fiscal year 2017 that includes a significant increase in NIH funding. So hopefully some of this uncertainty is already starting to wane. Now for a little more color on our Q3 performance by division. With 6% organic growth in the quarter, Q3 mark the seventh out of the past eight quarters that Biotech division has had at least mid-single digit growth. By product, the growth was broad-based with mid-single digit growth in both our antibody and assay product categories. Antibodies were again led by double digit growth in our Novus brand where our digital marketing campaigns and ongoing website enhancements continue to pay off. Our growth in assays for the quarter was driven by our Luminex products. Both in the assays, we sell ourselves, as well as the royalties we received from other Luminex and assay suppliers. We use our content in the production of their assays. Advanced Cell Diagnostics, also part of the Biotech segment, continued in Q3 with fantastic growth of nearly 60% on a standalone basis. ACD's technology continues to garner fast acceptance from research with over 800 publications to date. For example, as announced in a press release about a week ago, RNAscope in situ hybridization aided CDC researchers in advancing the understanding of Zika pathogenesis particularly as it relates to newborn children of infected mothers. During this past year, scientists around the world have intensified their research to reduce the impact of the Zika epidemic. RNAscope has been an essential tool in nine Zika publications. So we are proud to provide solutions that can help explain this complex and devastating virus. As a reminder, ACD products mostly fell into the RUL (07:27) market today where there is still plenty of new interest in applications that will allow for strong growth for years to come. But ACD is also currently working on strategies with an in (07:37) with partners, Leica in particular, that will open up ACD's products to a much larger market opportunity as a diagnostic tool. The opportunity that's still in front of this business give us more enthusiasm about ACD's potential every day. Moving on to Protein Platforms, this division also continued with its growth momentum, making the fifth quarter in a row of double-digit organic growth, four to five of those with growth at 20% or better. The growth is broad-based regionally with our Biologics product line continuing to lead away. Our Simple Plex platform also is rapidly gaining momentum, growing over 75% from last year. This product line has been a prime example of how our divisions fit together strategically and can generate growth from revenue synergies. We have organized a sales team for this platform of assay specialist from the Biotech division and instruments specials from the Protein Platforms division to work with our customers together and demonstrate the benefits of the highly accurate automated multiplex ELISA platform. I believe the growth rate speaks to how well it's working. Finally, the Simple Western product line contributed to growth as well, with yet another record number of West instruments sold during the quarter. As we've said before, Protein Platforms is plural, not singular, with a number of instrument platforms that's unique IP-protected technology, enabling high gross margins and the ability for this division to grow double digits for years to come. Finally, similar to last quarter, our Diagnostics division reported revenue in the quarter that was lower than last year. As I mentioned in my opening comments, this part of our business has a very different customer base than our other two divisions. As you have seen so far this fiscal year, quarterly revenue has been quite lumpy, with nearly 20% growth in Q1, revenue slightly down in Q2 and now lower by double-digits in Q3. Our OEM customers give us indications of up to 12 months in advance as to what their ordering patterns might look like. These are often large orders; sometimes as much as a year's supply a time. Therefore, when they are released for delivery, they can create large swings in quarterly revenue recognition. Based on our customer indications for deliveries at end of the last fiscal year, we planned for a much higher revenue growth in Q1 and Q4 of fiscal year 2017 and negative growth in Q2 and Q3. What we didn't plan for is the degree by which some customers have moved out their delivery dates, some even into our fiscal 2018, largely to hit their inventory internal management metrics. We had validated this by reaching out to each of them confirming no orders have been canceled. As a result, Q4 won't be as robust as a quarter for our Diagnostics division as we had initially planned, but we do expect to see a return to growth nonetheless. The part of our Diagnostics business that had short shelf life and more frequently delivered \u2013 delivery schedules, hematology controls, had a record quarter in Q3 and continues to grow healthy in the mid-single digits. This gives us insight into the end markets our OEM customer serve, and further validates what these customers are telling us regarding their internal inventory management practices. Over the long-term, the project pipeline for our Diagnostics division remains very strong with key markets to serve. A recent example of this was the innovative parasitological system we announced two months ago, PARATEST. This product is an innovative biodegradable system that could become a new standard providing highly accurate results in less time than existing tests and can be easily performed in the veterinarian's office without special equipment or training. It's opportunities like these and many more on the horizon that give us confidence that our Diagnostics division will be a solid contributor to the company's organic growth for years to come. Finally, I would like to highlight our adjusted operating margin performance in Q3. We were very transparent over the past several quarters about what kind of immediate impact the ACD acquisition was going to have in our margins. We were equally confident about how our adjusted operating margin would improve in the second half of fiscal 2017 as the ACD continued its revenue ramp and became less dilutive to the overall margin profile. True to our word, our adjusted operating margins increased sequentially over 200 basis points from Q2. Many thanks to our employees worldwide for their wonderful execution, which manifested on both our top and bottom line in Q3. In closing, we head into the final quarter of our fiscal year 2017 well-positioned to meet our financial objectives for the year. But more importantly, we should close fiscal year 2017 well-positioned to hit our long-term growth and profitability aspirations that we presented at our Investor Day last September. We just finished in presenting to our board our annual prioritization process. We use this process to look at all projects across the company, both current and proposed, and evaluate them against one another on criteria such as risk-adjusted financial return, strategic fit and competitive differentiation, just to name a few. These projects serve as the bottoms up building blocks of how we will achieve our long-term organic financial objectives. This year, we had over 200 projects to evaluate and compare, including a record number of cross divisional projects substantiating the strategic fit of all the acquisitions we have made to date which form these divisions. The output of this prioritization process, which will form the basis of our fiscal year 2018 operating plan, gives us confidence that we have the innovation and right path forward to attain our long-term financial goals. With that, I will turn the call over to Jim, who will provide more details on our financial performance for the quarter. Jim? James T. Hippel - Bio-Techne Corp.: Thanks Chuck. I will provide an overview of our Q3 financial performance for the total company and then provide some color on each of our three segments. Starting with the overall third quarter financial performance; adjusted EPS decreased 4% to $0.97. The impact of foreign exchange fluctuations represented a headwind to EPS of approximately $0.01. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.57, compared to $0.81 in the prior year. The biggest driver for the lower GAAP earnings are non-cash purchase accounting costs and contingent consideration revaluation associated with recent acquisitions. Q3 reported revenue was $144 million, an increase of 10% year-over-year, with organic revenue increasing 4%. Third quarter reported sales include an 8% growth contribution from acquisitions, partially offset by a 2% unfavorable foreign exchange headwind. By geography, the U.S. grew low-single digits, with growth comparable in both biopharma and academia. Europe grew over 20% organically, with biopharma sales growth over 30% and high single digit growth in academia. As a reminder, the Easter holiday occurred in March of this year versus the month of April last year. We estimate this contribute approximately 3% to Europe's growth in Q3 due to the extra selling days there. China's organic growth was in the low-teens in the third quarter, but as Chuck stated our Western brands grew nearly 30%, with similar contribution from both our instrument and reagent businesses. What partially offset this growth was our local PrimeGene brand most impacted by the CFDA shutdown of immunotherapies until they can be certified at a local government agency. Japan continued to improve in Q3 with organic growth in the mid-single digits. While the rest of the Asia-Pac region continue to perform very well, led by South Korea, with growth in the high teens. Note that all references made to growth rates by region and end market exclude our OEM sales, which mostly occur in our Diagnostics segment. Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin was 70.8% in Q3, similar to last quarter but down approximately 80 basis points from the prior year due to unfavorable mix. Foreign exchange had a nominal impact on adjusted gross margins year-over-year. Adjusted SG&A in Q3 was 23.9% of revenue, down nearly 200 basis points from prior quarter, but 325 basis points higher than last year. The SG&A increase was driven by the acquisitions made from the beginning of the fiscal year and strategic investments made in our core businesses to support growth. R&D expense in Q3 was 9.6% of revenue, 50 basis points less than prior quarter and 100 basis points higher than last year, mostly due to the acquisition of ACD in Q1. The resulting adjusted operating margin for Q3 was 37.3%, an increase of 210 basis points over the last quarter and a decrease of approximately 500 basis points in the prior year period. Recent acquisitions contribute 300 points to the decrease, with the remainder largely attributed to unfavorable mix and strategic investments made throughout the past year. Looking at our numbers below operating income. Net interest expense in Q3 was nearly $2 million compared $0.4 million of net interest expense last year. The higher interest expense is due to a $400 million line of credit which was opened in Q1 to replace our previous $150 million line of credit, as well as from the acquisition of ACD last August. Other non-operating expense for the quarter was $0.3 million compared to $0.7 million in the prior year quarter with less transactional FX expense this year driving the variance. Our adjusted effective tax rate in Q3 was 29.2%, an improvement of 180 basis points from the third quarter of last year due to geographic mix with growth in Europe and Asia outpacing growth in the U.S. where tax rates are the highest. In terms of returning capital, we continue to pay our dividend and paid out $11.9 million in the quarter. Average diluted shares were up less than 1% over the year ago period at 37.5 million shares outstanding. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. $24.4 million of cash was generated from operations in the third quarter and our investment in capital expenditures was $4 million. ACD had its first earn out milestone as of December 31, 2016 and its former shareholders earned their additional pay out of $25 million. For GAAP purposes, $8.8 million of this earn out is recorded as cash paid from operations. Management uses earn out as part of the purchase price paid for ACD, thus an investment rather than an operational cash expense. Excluding the earn out, the company's adjusted cash flow from operations was $33.2 million. As for other notable items on our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $113.6 million of cash and short-term available-for-sale investments. Our long-term debt obligations at the end of Q3 stood at $343.6 million, relatively flat from the end of Q2. Going forward, our capital deployment priorities remain opportunistic M&A, our dividend and debt pay down. Now I will discuss the performance of our three business segments, starting with the Biotechnology segment. Q3 reported sales were $94.5 million, with reported revenue increasing 16%. Acquisitions contributed 12% to revenue growth. Foreign exchange negatively impacted growth by 2% and organic growth was 6%. Organic growth was broad-based in all major product lines, but particularly strong in antibodies and assays. Adjusted operating income for the Biotech segment was relatively flat in Q3 compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 47.9%, a decrease of 760 basis points year-over-year, largely driven by the ACD acquisition, but also due to negative mix and strategic investments made throughout the past year. Excluding the ACD acquisition, adjusted operating margins was still a very healthy 53.3% for the division. Turning to Protein Platforms segment, net sales in Q3 were $23.6 million, an organic increase of 20% from the prior year period, with recent acquisitions contributing 1% to growth; and unfavorable currency translation roughly offsetting the impact from acquisitions. Growth for the segment was broad-based in most major regions and product lines, with particular contribution from our Biologics product line. Adjusted operating income in Q3 for the Protein Platforms segment was $3.3 million, representing an adjusted operating margin of 13.8%, an increase of 570 basis points from the prior year. Strong volume leverage drove the year-over-year improvement, partially offset by the strategic growth investments made throughout the past year and unfavorable FX. Moving on to our Diagnostics segment. Reported revenue in Q3 was $26 million, which reported an organic growth decreasing 13% from the prior year. Solid growth in blood and glucose-based controls was more than offset by the timing of OEM shipments from the diagnostic assay and reagent product lines. Our Diagnostics segment adjusted operating income decreased 37% in Q3 and adjusted operating margin was 23.1%, a decrease of 850 basis points from the prior year. The lower adjusted operating margin was attributable to lower sales volume and unfavorable mix. In summary, we had solid revenue execution across our biopharma and academic end markets globally, and managed our cost to reflect the timing realities we faced with our OEM customers in Diagnostics. We ended the third quarter year-to-date with a solid mid single-digit organic growth rate and we expect to finish fiscal year 2017 on that same trajectory. Keep in mind the slight headwinds we faced in Q4 with the timing of Easter, particularly in our business in Europe, as well as more typical year-over-year comps for both our Biotech and Protein Platforms divisions and the comps we had in Q3. With regards to profitability, we expect our adjusted operating margin to end the fiscal year at a rate similar to how we ended Q3, and our adjusted effective tax rate to revert back towards historical norms along with the geographic mix. That concludes my prepared comments. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Rebecca to open the line for some questions. Operator : And your first question will come from Dan Arias with Citi. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi. Good morning, guys. Chuck, on the timing issues in Diagnostics, can you just help us with how much of what you're seeing a delay on might fall into fiscal 2018 rather than 4Q? And then to that point, how do you think you finish the year in Diagnostics? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Well, I think it's going to be probably low single digits, at best, for finish, it all depends. We're roughly about $3 million or so off. It's really all on a couple of very, very, very large accounts and they're not somebody we can have a lot of influence on, they'll do what they do. But they have not \u2013 we've not lost them, they've just pushed them out, they're on a working capital crunch and it is what it is. Our pipeline, especially in where most of the pain is in our San Marcos is really, really strong. And the reasons \u2013 some of the reasons we bought this company are coming to bear next year with some really nice diagnostics platforms coming out. So, probably, low single digit this year, and I do still think our thesis of mid to upper single digits next year on is still sound actually. And if we get all of those orders back, I mean, they should be at top of that really. So hopefully, it will be a really good Q1 and Q2, so. From what they're telling us now. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Right. And within the biopharma segment, it sounds like Europe was the driver there, so, I guess, what are you expecting in terms of US customers from here? And then, overall, for pharma, are you still expecting a step up in your fiscal 4Q? I think that was the way you were thinking about things last time around. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Well, we're expecting Europe to continue. We'll see the French election and further Brexit stuff happening and all, but we are really executing well. We are firing on all cylinders there. And couple of years ago, we were in bit of a timing mishap with a lot of our biopharma, that's \u2013 we're still in a good timing cycle. That could change going forward, at some point, I'm sure it will, but we don't see them in the short-term horizon, it's looking very, very strong. And I think in the U.S., I think given the news yesterday, I think we'll start seeing some improvements there too. We're still seeing growth. It's just needs to be mid-single-digit and it was low this quarter, but looking forward, I think we're back to mid-single-digit. Again, we have some timing issues too, I talked about last quarter. We've got a lot of large company OEM-type business and custom work we do and similar to what we faced in Germany and Europe two years ago, we were seeing this year. And that kind of corrects itself next year for biopharma here in the U.S. And academia, we continue to further reduce our risk with academia, we've taken the company from 40% overall globally to roughly 25% in academia. In the U.S. component academia is only 15% of global results now. So, but we further reduce the risk there and that's going to also help although I think we see academia bouncing back a bit here too. And given the NIH information yesterday should be hopefully a nice 6% or full pop on top of the budget increase before and \u2013 we have yet to see really a lot of that even flow through at all yet, so. (24:31) Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay, great. Yeah, hopefully so. And then if I could sneak one more in for Jim. Jim on the operating margins they were down year-over-year, but as you said up sequentially. So as you guys move to your next fiscal year, can you just touch on from an organic standpoint how you feel about 2017 sort of being the trough year at the EBIT margin line? I mean, I know deals can always influence that but ex any M&A, where's the confidence that from 2017 you begin to move higher as ACD scales et cetera? James T. Hippel - Bio-Techne Corp.: I mean really nothing has changed from what we've communicated for the past year in terms of the margin profile and I think this quarter proved it out. We do expect fiscal year 2017 to be the trough because of the recent acquisition of ACD. We expected the first half and more specifically the second quarter to be the trough within the year and that has occurred. And therefore our thesis just going forward continues to be gradually expanding margins as ACD continue to ramp. We continue to ramp also in Protein Platforms and hold our solid margins in the Biotech segment. The only thing that will keep it from accelerating faster than maybe what I did most recent quarter is again the offsetting mix, as Protein Platforms continue to grow faster than the overall company there'll be some offsetting mix there, but overall, gradual increase in operating margins going forward. And nothing has waned our confidence in that. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yes. Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Next we'll hear from Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Appreciate dispersion in China between the Western products and PrimeGene, but can you give us the overall growth rate for the business in China incorporating both of those variables? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: It's low teens. Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: It'll start reaccelerating back. We actually have acceleration in our core brands, we're near 30%. So as the other stuff comes back online here through PrimeGene, our local brands, and our China for China, we hope to be at a net over 20% or better maybe after next quarter. This quarter it could still be teens or better but after that should be a solid 20 plus percent again, which we'll get it for 10 quarters in a row, so. Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And Chuck, are you contemplating any changes in your go-to-market strategy in the U.S., whether it would be distribution, more sales people or anything on that front after a couple of quarters where the growth rate has been a little bit lower than you'd like? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Very insightful question. When you look at results like this and have been for a while, and we're not alone. I think others have been talking about the same kind of situation. We've got to figure out how much is related to funding and panic and things like that versus reality. We still are working with Fisher, of course. We also work third-party with other distribution. We're looking at other potential partners as well. And we continue to expand our local direct sales force. So we've actually moved it up considerably. We need to look at that because as we further \u2013 actually model \u2013 the model like we did in Europe is getting in commercial groups working together across divisions, it calls for more specialists and more assay specialists, as an example, more people that understand our immunotherapeutic contributions, our reagents. And that's going to help us overall with growth. So it's a tuning towards the collaboration between divisions as where the investments will be. And it's kind of doubling down on working more with distributions as well just more on the \u2013 I would say, on how we promote and how our products are on their systems, et cetera. And then on top of all that, we continue to further improve our website. So we're making that better and better and that's how we really still support academia primarily. So that's also been improving our, I guess, our levels of people being online are up over double-digit, low teens at this point year-on-year. So we like what we see there as well. So I think as the funding issues kind of work through and some of the timing issues with OEM that kind of bleed into everything else in the U.S. business, I think we'll see a natural improvement come next year. Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks for all the color. Operator : From Leerink Partners, we'll go to Puneet Souda. Puneet Souda - Leerink Partners LLC : Yeah. Hi, Chuck and Jim. Thanks for taking my questions. So first on the ACD, could you update us on the progress towards the clinic? You highlighted a couple of examples but overall, are your products moving towards the clinics? So, 60% growth in the quarter, do you think that sort of level continues as you reach into the clinical markets? And can you give us a sense of spend there a bit also and how it's tracking? It seems like there's improvement in your operating margins, but could you give us specifically on ACD? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Sure. Well, our thesis is when we bought it was 50% or better, and we think that will hold true. So they're well ahead now in terms of meeting their end of calendar year milestones for earn out. We paid off or we're going to be paying off the one from this last \u2013 end of calendar year. So they are doing really well. Their commercial investments are on track. Really all of their marketing investments are on track. We're starting to integrate them into our commercial activities. As an example, Europe this summer will include that team, we're already working on the groups in Europe and we have a team in Milan as well as their group is in Milan, so there's growth there. Asia is also starting to pick up, especially in China we're starting to add some people. We're still leaving them a lot of freedom being there as an earn out, but the collaboration integration is actually well ahead of schedule, to be honest. Continuing at 60%, we want to play that down, it's just wonderful that they're at that level. We mentioned the publication count is over 800. It is very, very quickly being adopted. I think the nice thing about that business, and unlike the instrument business, is we're doing well with Protein Platforms, that's, much more lumpy, much more end of the quarter. It is just a nice constant run rate business we're seeing. We're seeing that almost mimic some of our other reagent businesses that are very safe and very, very well distributed across customer, a large customer base. So Yuling who runs this business for us, who was the founder of the company, is still very excited and he hasn't taken his foot off the pedal at all at this point, so I think we got a strong year ahead there. And then I think we're proving, as they scale because this is a great \u2013 it is an 80% gross margin business. And while although it's a higher cost commercial model than like our Protein, our antibody business, it's still very good. It will last into about (31:09) near 40% long-term. It will be a couple of years to get there, but we've about them being profitable next year some time, we'll probably moving that up a quarter or two so. Puneet Souda - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay great and great for that. Thanks for that. So in terms of Protein Simple, the segment came in, obviously, very strong compared to our estimates. Could you to describe the growth you're seeing in the QA, QC platform end of the business versus the Ella and the West, if you could parse that out compared to the downstream products including iCE? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Well, we don't give details in each category. We had strong growth in every platform we sell there. And there's roughly four major platforms, not counting the imaging legacy platforms, which is not growing, which is a stable, if not declining, probably still flat or better in China, but overall, it's a declining segment. But everything else is flying, and it is led off by Biologics. I'll tell you Biologics is the lead. And Simple Plex, by percentage, is actually smaller base but it's really growing fast. And the cartridge adoption rate that we talked about is hitting all our models, so it's doing very well. Simple Western, we're at roughly 75% or so versus (32:23) a quarter now and we see it continuing. Big box probably saturating, probably slowing down but being picked up by the West so the overall category is still growing very nicely. And we talked about there was a 1% increase in there due to acquisitions, that's Zephyr's, (32:40) that's the Milo platform and it's starting to ramp but that's obviously a smaller platform and with the single cell Western Blot category, and we're seeing that start to pick up now too, it's starting to go over end of the near double-digit instrument placements per quarter, so we're getting there. Puneet Souda - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. Thanks for the color, Chuck. Operator : Next we'll hear from Catherine Schulte with Robert W. Baird. Catherine Ramsey Schulte - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hey, guys. Thanks for the questions. And back on Protein Platforms, can you remind us the split between academic, government on pharma and what you saw from each of those end markets? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: They're roughly equal. We serve both about the same and the growth is broad-based. I would say the Biologics is much more tuned towards the biopharma, obviously and that's where the biggest growth was. As a split, we probably have more growth on biopharma over academia, whereas we have really good growth in the Simple Western on all fronts, especially academia. So they do serve a little bit different markets. And we like the Biologics platform as a segment because it supports production, it's really the only category in our company that actually is all about production to biopharma and it's really lighting up, it's doing very, very well. James T. Hippel - Bio-Techne Corp.: And just to reiterate a little more. The way I think about that, Catherine, is our Biologics product line is basically 100% biopharma. Our Simple Western product line is composed of 50-50 between the two, biopharma and academic. Catherine Ramsey Schulte - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. And can you give us some color on the M&A pipeline and environment and what kind of asset or vertical would be most attractive to you? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Well, we're hunting on all fronts. We definitely suffered the risk of going an entire year without a deal here come August, we're always working on two, three or four at a time and we still are to this day. We had a couple in getaway recently \u2013 more work needed academically but we're still hunting. I think we're still very interested in areas of leveraging Diagnostics, similar to what we did with our (34:48) investment recently or with ACD. We'll look at all the ACDs we can find. We're hunting in China, really in a lot of categories, even our core, just for scale, if nothing else. We continue to be hunting in Europe for the same thing, there are some opportunities there we are seeing forming. In terms of new platform areas, I think additional areas around single cell, around flow, or any work stream that the scientists do and handle and use our reagents and understand our brands is fair gain for us, that's our model. We picked off a few but there's a lot more to pick off, right, so. Catherine Ramsey Schulte - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : From William Blair, Amanda Murphy. Amanda Louise Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi, good morning. So I just had a few follow-ups here. So I guess, first, on the omnibus agreement. So, obviously, that's a good thing, I was just curious how quickly that you might see that flow into the P&L, just based on historical... Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: I'm sorry, Amanda. We couldn't understand the first part of your question? Amanda Louise Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Let me start over. So I just had a follow-up on the omnibus budget piece of the commentary. So obviously, it's a good thing if that actually goes through, but I just was curious how quickly we might see that come through the P&L, just based on your historical experience. And then just another part of that, obviously, you've seen a lot of strength in Europe from an academic perspective at least recently is that \u2013 I guess, could we see or when will we see that same dynamic in the U.S. (36:31) this increase? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Well, I guess, that is the big question I was going to start wondering about starting from yesterday. I mean, the last real budget increase was a good one, 6.5% over a year ago and we were not sure we saw that flow through before we start seeing the panic, given the administration and tweets and such. There was the Cures Act which really hasn't seen that extra bit flow through. Now we have this, which is really supposed to be just through the rest of this fiscal budget, which could be a pretty good pop if panic releases or if there is an assumption that it's a use it or lose it budget or something. It's too soon I know, I guess, I haven't seen any real clarity on that. In sense it's the same kind of 6.5% or so from the previous budget a year or so ago, we have done the math and as you remember and we thought it flow-through to roughly 1% add to our organic growth in the U.S. So we could say that's probably entitlement again, and maybe we haven't seen it all from before, so hopefully 1% to 2% of addition. So if we're mid-single digits or lower \u2013 it should give us a safe low to mid \u2013 high mid-single-digit area, that's what we're kind of hoping for. We had seven quarters like in a row of 5% or 6% and we had last quarter at 2% and now we're back at 6%. Just to stay really safe, it is 6% or 7%, given this would really make me happy and that's kind of our goal. And we're going after them from a number of different tactics and strategies we talked about distribution website, the assays we're doing, they're all kind of working. But this year, we're kind of offset by a lot of the OEM timing, so I think that's the bigger handle I think for next year. We see OEM and custom kind of swinging back this projects come back online with some of our bigger accounts, I think we'll get back within our sale along with, hopefully, this budget influx. So it should be a good year. Amanda Louise Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC: I was also going to ask, just given your commentary on the distribution side, so (38:31) that agreement has really gotten some traction. And is that \u2013 based on that, and maybe if you see some amplification in terms of the budget pulling through versus historical, am I kind of reaching there? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Yeah, you're probably reaching. I'm not sure how any of that would influence any more productivity we got at Fisher. I think and we've talked about \u2013 Fisher had a great start with us and we definitely did some homework within the last couple of years. I think since they've increased their bag, so to speak, with the Life Tech (39:04) and other products, it's been an issue there for us, but they continue to be loyal with us. We obviously know all them very well personally and we continue to work on programs together and we're still contractually obligated and nothing's changed there. And you got to adjust with the market and the conditions and what's going on, and they continue to do so and we continue to push that as well. Nothing different in our other high-content partners like the BD (39:30) or other I'm sure are asking as well, so. Amanda Louise Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC: All right. Okay. And then just last one for me on \u2013 you talked about strands in antibodies and this maybe hard to tease out but maybe then qualitatively, could you help us understand, you, obviously, laid out the opportunity for revenue synergies across all of the business. I was just curious if you can give us a context there how that's going there...? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Yeah. We'll give you some, but we don't go to too much detail. Amanda Louise Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yeah. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: I would say all of the acquisitions we've done, Novus is certainly one of the ones performing the best. They're really back performing even better than they were before the acquisition. They're in solid teens for growth rates both here and in Europe. It's largely sourced and we have an amazing website driving the product as well. I think in terms of allowing proof writing content online to better compete with our competitors who have been doing it longer than we have. I think we're also catching up and making ground. In terms of where it is a bit bimodal, as I mentioned, the retail kind of piece of it will drive, it's really growing extremely well, it's low teens. The OEM side is soft this year because of the timing of projects, so that's just something that will fall in that bucket. And a lot of the R&D Systems branded antibodies also and the ability to create proteins from that competency we have that are in that area, we see that kind of rebounding here. And I think we see no softness coming with Novus, so I think antibodies are looking very good going forward. And I will also mention, as we mentioned a couple of quarters ago, even three now, when we launched our ERP site, it was a bit of all hands on deck for a quarter or two. From people who knew our systems and knew how things got done internally, and guess what, a lot of the people we had that were doing custom design work were actually called in the action to help with the ERP. So we were definitely softer a couple of quarters ago, and that pipeline is really now filled again for custom, so... So that's why we think things pretty good going forward in the next year in that area. So all in, net-net, we have a great antibody number. But it is in pieces and the thing to remember I think is Novus continues to accelerate and I think the way we promote and advertise and drive the digital marketing around our antibody platforms gets better and better and we are definitely, I think at this point taking some share in some categories. Amanda Louise Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you. Operator : Next we will hear from Matt Hewitt with Craig-Hallum Capital Group. Matthew G. Hewitt - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC : Good morning, gentlemen, and congratulations on the good quarter. Couple of questions. First, Q4 a year ago, you held a big sales meeting in Barcelona, and really were focused on driving some cross-selling opportunities between the Biotech and Protein Platforms segments. I'm curious, looking back almost a year, how has that program aided those two divisions? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Well, I think our results speak for themselves. We're in the 30% growth in Protein Platforms and solid double-digits in the core business for a net overall, above 20%. I've been doing business for 25-plus years and I've never had a quarter this good in Europe, to be honest in anything I have ever managed, here at Thermo or 3M. I think the execution is amazing and we can actually point to a lot of things that are making it work. One is exactly what you said, the designs, the collaborations, the processes that we put in place at the European sales in the last summer are working. The teams are working together across divisions and also in terms of a reagent selling versus FAS is for instruments. It is team selling. We don't rely on a Fisher partner or something similar here because it's completely a direct model and we've invested there. So we are very good and a large enough sales force, and we've built it out by country, we've made some investments also in the past year in some countries or regions that we didn't have great strength for those call it some low-hanging fruit to pick-up. And then the acquisition of space, our Italian distributor who had been with us for 20 years, 85% of what they sold was our stuff anyway. So that owner is our Southern European Managing Director, reporting in to our Head of Europe. And he's been helping on getting things really going in Spain, in Eastern Europe, and so we're getting extra incremental growth there from just his leadership and his knowledge of the company and portfolio. It's just kind of working well that way. It's Europe it won't be forever, but right now things are going quite well. And then we just happen to have the OEM \u2013 biopharma timing wind in our sail right now. We're 1.5 years into that and that will likely switch in a year or two from now as well I'm sure, but Brexit could have an impact. We have not really seen any real fallout from that yet. If there ends up being sanctions and pulls (44:38) in the U.K., we are ready with strategies to really move and get more versatile in Greater Europe if we need to. We've got other reinventory sites and hubs to work with, including Southern Europe as an example. So I think we're in good shape. The meeting this year is going to be in Dublin, and it's going to include the ACD team as well as, so we are getting ready to integrate all that. And that will just be more growth to pile on this coming year. So we're really excited about ACD becoming part of the team in Europe and going after the growth that they've \u2013 really it's hard to get started on so far, so. Matthew G. Hewitt - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC : Great. Thank you very much for the color there. And then just one more, couple of different times you've mentioned some of the investments that you've made into the sales and marketing teams. Do you have a head count number for your team, sales team this year versus maybe in the year-ago period, or just to give us a size \u2013 or how much that's grown maybe? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Maybe a couple of examples and I only give you this because it speaks to how we've really worked on productivity and helped pay for these investments, as we've mentioned over the last four years. When I joined four years ago, we had zero sales people in the field in the U.S. We had seven inside sales. We now have 12 people in the U.S. and we still have about 8 to 10 inside sales, that's in the core B-to-D. We had roughly 8 people in China in total we now have over 100, half of our PrimeGene in manufacturing, but we're at 15 to 20 people, because you have to cover China kind of province by province, city by city. Europe has about doubled over all, and we're probably all in commercially probably in the 50s range between all divisions with marketing. We have roughly 200 people in Europe now overall, and we were about 80 four years ago. And to sum it altogether, commercially, globally right now sales and marketing of all three divisions globally, we're roughly at about a 200-person head count, which is a metric we watch and I like to watch personally. So we've come a long way. We're investing huge and we're paying for it with productivity and growth, so. Matthew G. Hewitt - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC : Great. Thank you very much for that. Operator : And your final question comes from Paul Knight with Janney Montgomery. Carolina Ibanez-Ventoso - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Hi. Good morning. This is Carolina Ibanez-Ventoso on for Paul Knight. Thank you for taking the question. Could you comment a little bit more on the drivers of this trends you alluded to in antibodies on your Novus brand? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Well, your question is about the strength in antibody with Novus. Carolina Ibanez-Ventoso - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Yes, so if you can allude to the drivers like \u2013 of that strength? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: When we kind of began this model four years ago, we had R&D Systems brand and the brand is pretty well-known brand but very narrow. And we had roughly 15,000 to 20,000 products, which may sound like a lot of products, but when you get to antibodies, it's not. Our nearest competitor, Abcam was around 170,000 at that point, and I don't think they've changed much since then. When we picked up Novus, we added over 200,000 new antibodies, all from mostly from (47:44) and a couple of things that they made their own, so they made 4,000 or 5,000 antibodies themselves. So we're well over 20,000 antibodies now that we actually make and manufacture ourselves. And we source well over 200,000-plus on top of that. S o that gives a very wide diverse set of products and supporting everything from Western Blot to iCE (48:08) to all of different work streams that use antibodies. And from all the known makers of which we provide some of those brands, but we also use Novus brand as well as R&D Systems brand. This is a very much \u2013 this part is very much like an Abcam who actually source maybe the same (48:23) suppliers, to be honest. And I think on top of having the convenience and choice of our portfolio of our customers, I think the website and the tools we put in place to help sell this to customers has really vastly improved. Novus had a great site, and together, we've really improved it over all in the R&D Systems websites in our overall company website and access models. And that's also helped a lot. In addition, we picked up Protein Simple. We have the Simple Western platform, so we've actually went to the work of certifying a couple of thousand different antibodies doing the work ahead of time on the dilution levels and how to dial in these products so that you aren't wasting sample or antibody. So customers know what they buy, they can get to work right away, it's very productive, that has helped drive some growth. I mean there's a lot of tactics, but the overall, I think is Novus, Novus brand, the breadth, the better website, the better access, we follow customer metrics, we follow NPS, our NPS metrics have been going up continually, we have in R&D Systems well over 70% NPS, which is your Net Promoter Score. All these things matter and you got to keep working to make customers happy. And especially in academia and as you know, it's a very, very distributed model, so it's hard to drive overall \u2013 but hey we'll take the results, it's kind of working well. Carolina Ibanez-Ventoso - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Thank you. And then in the sense of end markets, you're seeing good response across pharma, academia or it's more weighted in one versus the other? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Yes. Your question is about how we are now \u2013 our market \u2013 our end markets are weighted? And I made comments earlier (50:10) Carolina Ibanez-Ventoso - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : ...like staying on antibodies, you were commenting on different... Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: I would say antibodies are probably a little more towards the academia than the biopharma, where those sections are much more the other way, is, overall, we've definitely reduced the dependence on academia and we're down to roughly 25% globally, a lot of that shift the mix of the instrument business and things coming in. But the U.S. component is down about 15%. And it is probably pretty much \u2013 it always has been roughly equal kind of split we think between now let's say the assays, the antibodies and proteins, so. Carolina Ibanez-Ventoso - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Okay. Thank you for all the color. Operator : And at this time, I would like to turn the call back over to management for any additional of concluding remarks. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Okay. Well, thanks for all the great questions. We're very excited about this quarter and we look forward to speaking with all you again this coming quarter. Thanks. Bye. Operator : And that does conclude today's presentation. We do thank everyone for your participation.",

I'll now turn the call over to Chuck. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter conference call. As you saw in our press release, we ended the year on a strong note and I'm very pleased with our fourth quarter results, as well as the execution of our strategic plan all year. The company delivered 8% organic growth in the quarter and achieved 6% growth organically for all of fiscal year 2017. Our two divisions that primarily serve the life science research market, Biotechnology and Protein Platforms, collectively grew organically by 7% both in Q4 and for the full-year. And although we can't comment as organic growth here until the acquisition annualizes in August, ACD grew over 50% in Q4 on a standalone basis. By geography, Europe results were outstanding for the year, experiencing double-digit growth that continued into Q4. With new leadership established last year along with an acquisition of our most loyal distributor in Southern Europe, we embarked on creating a more unified European subsidiary with attention to cross-selling and regional collaboration. It worked. We finished 2017 with double-digit organic growth and a team now of 200-plus strong. As in Europe, our Asia region also performed very well. In China, growth of our Western brands grew over 30% in Q4 and were up 25% for the full-year. The CFDA crackdown and on cell therapies administered by hospitals due to the Baidu scandal over one-year ago was a drag on our locally produced PrimeGene brand in China results overall. But for most of fiscal 2018, the worst will be behind us and we should see increased contribution again from this part of the China market, as the CFDA gradually gets through its certifications. As for the rest of APAC, the region overall performed well in fiscal year 2017. Japan appears to have turned the corner with low single-digit growth for the year, while the rest of APAC experienced double-digit growth. Here in the U.S., we finished the year with mid-single-digit growth for both the quarter and the year. The academia end markets grew in the low single digits throughout the year, with uncertainty around future NIH funding and the clinical environment creating a drag on new life science research funding decisions. But the FY 2017 budget finally passed with a modest increase in funding and we'll hopefully see an uptick in new academic projects as we start our new fiscal year 2018. This year we extended our partnership with Fisher Scientific and further expanded how we work together. They performed very well for us in Q4, especially in academia, and we expect even better results from this strong collaboration going forward. The Biopharma market in the U.S. was stronger for us in Q4 than it was in Q3, which is consistent with the lumpiness we saw throughout the year. We believe project timing at some of the larger pharma companies is what has been driving the quarterly variability, but Biopharma is still in a long-term uptrend, especially in bioprocessing, and we have been increasing our sales force in North America to capture this upside. Now for a little more color on our Q4 performance by division. Our Biotech division grew 2% organically in Q4 and finished the full year with 4% organic growth. This division was most impacted by the end market issues in both academia and Biopharma in the U.S. that I just described, and also was impacted by the lower PrimeGene sales in China. By product, the growth was driven by the sale of antibodies, which has been a strategic focus of ours for the past several years. Antibodies were again led by double-digit growth in our Novus brand, where our digital marketing campaigns and ongoing website enhancements continue to pay off. Our website now offers over 100 active pathways to better assist researches in finding the readings they need and uses more sophisticated search engine optimization to finalize product selection. The metrics speak for themselves. We've experienced a significant increase in web traffic, which is critical to the academic catalog sales efforts, double-digit growth in web traffic, and our antibody business in particular really benefiting from improved website metrics. Looking forward, we see product specific information as a true business tool and we have many new exciting projects to further accelerate our growth by the use of information for management pricing, promotions, channels, et cetera. Big data has found us too. Innovation also continues to fuel long-term growth for our Biotech division. Last year we introduced over 1,500 new reagent products and had first year product revenue similar to the past year. We are currently 500% better in vitality for new reagent product revenue than we were four years ago. And finally, there is Advanced Cell Diagnostics, the newest part of the Biotech division, which will annualize this August. The ACD marks Bio-Techne entry into genomics market. More importantly, its innovative and versatile technology has potential to change pathology practices from the current method of using antibodies. RNA in-situ hybridization transformative technology is facilitating and improving the marketing of gene expression patterns at the single cell level, while retaining the morphological context of a tissue being analyzed. ACD's technology serves both the research and diagnostic markets, expanding Bio-Techne's presence in the clinical lab setting. ACD had a stellar year in 2017 with over 50% growth in revenue on a standalone basis. This fiscal year we look forward to adding ACD's growth to the corporate organic metrics. Full integration of ACD is ongoing and we anticipate it will be completed in fiscal year 2018. With revenue growth expected to continue at over 40%, we believe it could become a company division in the coming year. Are there more ACDs in our future? We hope so. We are still hungry for more acquisitions and we have the balance sheet capacity for them, but it is important that we acquire assets at good prices and that we have the infrastructure in place to integrate them into the growing company. Moving on to Protein Platforms. This division also continued with its growth momentum, marking a sixth quarter in a row of double-digit organic growth. Five out of six of those had growth at 20% or better. Getting our Protein Platforms division back to a 20% organic growth rate has been a difficult, but rewarding achievement for us. This has come from a combination of good new product introduction and applications, as well as some strong commercial synergies with the Biotech division, which sells the reagents used by the Protein Platforms division's instruments. When we acquired ProteinSimple, it was primarily for the Simple Western instruments in the Western blot screen, $1 billion dollar opportunity. That opportunity remains, but the division also has strong double-digit growth business in Biologics instruments used in bioprocessing of proteins and Biopharma. We have some customers with nearly 100 instruments. The Protein Platforms division also manages the Simple Plex technology platform, which came through the CyVek acquisition. It is now growing over 70% per year and its revenues have become material for the Protein Platforms division and the company overall. We've instrument placements in majority of big pharma accounts and we believe it is on its way to becoming a standard tool using clinical trials, and eventually a potential standard diagnostic platform for point-of-care. Next our Diagnostics division rebounded nicely this quarter with 14% organic growth, finishing the year with 3% growth. As I have mentioned on prior calls, our OEM customers in this business ordered a large quantities of controls, kits, and bulk reagents at one time and their ordering patterns can vary from quarter-to-quarter, causing large swings in our quarterly revenue growth. Our growth for the year is more representative of our Diagnostics customers' market condition. Over the long-term, the project pipeline for our Diagnostics division remain very strong with new markets to serve. We will be expanding our subsidiary model in Europe to include the Diagnostics division and drive new opportunities with customers there, further expanding our sales funnel. And innovation doesn't just reside in our other two divisions. Notably, in fiscal year 2017 we launched a new product in the Diagnostics division, PARATEST, which is a fecal exam, also called an ova and parasite test, used to diagnose intestinal parasitic infection in companion animals such as dogs and cats. The fragile nature of infecting organisms make sample collection very important. This is our first foray into the veterinary market and we believe it represents significant opportunity to contribute to our growth. Finally, I'd like to highlight our adjusted operating margin performance for Q4. We were very transparent over the past year about what kind of immediate impact the ACD acquisition was going to have on our margins. We were equally confident about how our adjusted operating margin would improve in the second half of fiscal year 2017, as ACD continued its revenue ramp and became less dilutive to the overall margin profile. True to our word, our adjusted operating margin increased sequentially by over 150 basis points over Q3, and that's after Q3 had expanded over 200 basis points from Q2. Now we can't expect that kind of sequential performance indefinitely, but it is a testament to the wonderful execution by our employees, which manifested on both our top and bottom line in Q4 and entire year of fiscal 2017. Fiscal 2017 was an epic year for the company, ending with 13% overall revenue growth and 6% in organic revenue growth. We believe we are tracking very close to our strategic plan. The company is diversifying in many adjacent life science areas that will provide accelerated growth and safety for investors, with results from a reliable growth [charter]. Our acquisitions, while fundamental to our growth plans, are now an enabler to meet or exceed our five year targets. Fiscal 2018 will be a year where we hope to close one or more acquisitions, grow to over 2,000 employees, and exceed $600 million in revenue. This will represent a doubling of our capabilities in the past five years, all while preserving strong operating margins. What really makes this company a great company, though, is its employees. Now nearly 1,800 strong worldwide, our team has focused a lot of energy on our culture, synergies, and accomplishments to create an enduring company devoted to life science. I want to thank all of our employees for a remarkable year in 2017 and look forward to working with the team as we continue our journey in 2018. With that, I will turn the call over to Jim to provide more details on our financial performance for the quarter. Jim? James T. Hippel - Bio-Techne Corp.: Thanks, Chuck. I'll provide an overview of our Q4 financial performance for the total company, and then provide some color on each of our three segments. Starting with the overall fourth quarter financial performance; adjusted EPS increased 18% to $1.09. The impact of foreign exchange fluctuations represent a headwind to EPS of approximately $0.01. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.77, compared to $0.69 in the prior year. Q4 reported revenue was $156.6 million, an increase of 16% year-over-year, with organic revenue increasing 8%. Fourth quarter reported sales include a 9% growth contribution from acquisitions, partially offset by a 1% unfavorable foreign exchange headwind. By geography, the U.S. grew mid-single digits, with Biopharma growing in the high-single digits and academia in the low single digits. Europe revenues increased over 10% organically, with Biopharma sales growth in the low teens and academia around 10%. As a reminder, the Easter holiday occurred in March of this year versus the month of April last year. We estimate this negatively impacted Europe's Q4 growth by approximately 3%, making Europe's results for the quarter even more impressive. China's organic growth was in the high single digits in the fourth quarter. But, as Chuck stated, our Western brands grew over 30%, with similar contribution from both our instruments and reagent businesses. What partially offset this growth was our local PrimeGene brand most impacted by the CFDA shutdown of immunotherapy until it can be certified by the local government agency. Japan continued to rebound in Q4, with organic growth in the mid-single digits, while the rest of Asia-Pacific region continued to perform well, with growth in the high single digits. Note that all references made to growth rates by region and end market exclude our OEM sales, which mostly occur in our Diagnostics segment. Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin was 71.8% in Q3, favorable approximately 170 basis points in the prior year due to strong operational productivity and volume leverage offsetting unfavorable product mix. Foreign exchange had a nominal impact on adjusted gross margins year-over-year. Adjusted SG&A in Q4 was 24.2% of revenue, similar to the prior quarter, about 135 basis points higher than last year. The SG&A increase was driven by the acquisitions made since the beginning of the fiscal year and to a lesser extent strategic investments made in our core businesses to support growth. R&D expense in Q4 was 8.7% of revenue, approximately the same as the prior year. The resulting adjusted operating margin for Q4 was 38.9%, an increase of 160 basis points over the last quarter and a decrease of approximately 10 basis points over the prior-year period. Operational productivity and volume leverage came close to offsetting the 220 point negative impact from acquisitions made early in Q1 of fiscal year 2017. Looking our numbers below operating income, net interest expense in Q4 was nearly $2 million compared to $0.4 million of net interest expense last year. The higher interest expense is due to a $400 million line of credit, which was opened in Q1 to replace our previous $150 million line of credit, as well as to fund the acquisition of ACD last August. Other non-operating expense for the quarter was $0.4 million compared to $1.9 million in the prior year quarter, with less transactional FX expensed this year driving the variance. Our adjusted effective tax rate in Q4 was 29.7%, an improvement of 180 basis points from the fourth quarter of last year due to geographic mix. In terms of returning capital, we continue to pay our dividend and paid out $11.9 million in the quarter. Average diluted shares were up less than 0.5% over the year ago period at 37.5 million shares outstanding. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. $54.3 million of cash was generated from operations in the fourth quarter and our investment in capital expenditures was $5.2 million. Excluding acquisition earn-out payments, which for GAAP purposes are deducted from operating cash flow, our adjusted cash flow from operations for the quarter was $57 million and $158 million for the total year, both new records for the company. Management view these earn-outs as part of the purchase price paid for acquisitions that's an investment rather than an operational cash expense. Excellent execution on net working capital management, both in the areas of inventory and collection, contributed to our overall cash flow performance. As for other notable items on our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $157.7 million of cash and short-term available-for-sale investments. Our long-term debt obligations at the end of Q4 stood at $343.8 million, flat from the end of Q3. Going forward, our capital deployment priorities remain opportunistic M&A, our dividend, and debt pay down. Now discuss the performance of our three business segments, starting with the Biotechnology segment. Q4 reported sales were $97.2 million, with reported revenue increasing 15%. Acquisitions contributed 14% to revenue growth; foreign exchange negatively impacted growth by 1%; and organic growth was 2%, with particularly strong growth in antibody sales helping offset tough comp from last year. For the year, Biotech segment achieved 4% organic growth. Adjusted operating income for the Biotech segment was nearly $4 million higher in Q4 compared to the prior year, while adjusted operating margin was 49.3%, an increase of 140 basis points over Q3 and a decrease of 310 basis points year-over-year. The decrease in prior year is due to the acquisition of ACD, while the sequential increase reflects the bottom line improvements we see in ACD as it continues to scale. Excluding the ACD acquisition, adjusted operating margins in the quarter were very healthy, 55.3% for the division, nearly a 300 basis point improvement over prior year, where strong operational productivity more than offset the strategic investments being made to drive future growth. Turning to Protein Platforms segment, net sales in Q4 were $26.8 million, an organic increase of 24% from the prior year period, with an unfavorable currency translation impact of 2%. Growth for this segment was driven by the Biologics product line, representing the strength of the Biopharma end market, with particular strength in Europe and Asia. Simple Plex was also a notable contributor with 100% growth in the quarter over last year. Adjusted operating income in Q4 for the Protein Platforms segment was $4.3 million, representing an adjusted operating margin of 16.2%, an increase of 870 basis points from the prior year. Strong volume leverage and cost productivity, particularly in Simple Plex, drove the year-over-year improvement, partially offset by strategic growth investments made throughout the past year. Protein Platforms ended the full year with adjusted operating margin of 10.5%, a significant milestone as it continues to march towards even higher double-digit profitability. Moving on to our Diagnostics segment, reported revenue in Q4 was $32.6 million, with reported inorganic growth increasing 14% from the prior year. The positive trend in shipments from previously delayed OEM orders contribute significantly to the growth this quarter. The underlying market growth of our OEM customers is more represented in the segment's full year growth of 3%. However, as Chuck discussed previously, there is a strong pipeline of new OEM projects and innovative products, like PARATEST, that we believe will allow this division to outpace market growth in the years to come. The Diagnostics segment adjusted operating income increased 18% in Q4 and adjusted operating margin was 32.1%, an increase of 70 basis points from the prior year. The increase was driven by the volume leverage partially offset by unfavorable product mix. In summary, we had a solid revenue execution across our end markets globally. We are relentless in driving operational productivity and we prudently invested back into the business using our prioritization process that will drive the highest returns for growth and allow us to achieve our long-term financial objective. This was true not only in Q4, but also for the full year of fiscal year 2017, where we ended the year with 6% organic revenue growth. As we look to the year ahead, we expect overall fiscal year 2018 organic revenue growth to be comparable to that of fiscal year 2017. Diagnostics growth could be a little higher as new projects come online and Protein Platforms growth, albeit still solid double digits, could be a little softer, given the tougher comps and larger base of business going into fiscal year 2018. However, we expect the biggest difference in fiscal year 2018 will be annualizing ACD and including its growth in our organic metrics, which could be as much as a couple of percentage points on top of the organic growth we reported in fiscal year 2017. With regard to profitability in fiscal year 2018, we are driving to hold our strong operating margins in the Biotech segment and maintain our operating margins in our OEM driven Diagnostics segment. In Protein Platforms, we expect to continue delivering higher operating margins as the business continue to scale. While in ACD, we expect it to cross its profitability, albeit modestly, for the first time, despite the heavy investments that will continue to be made to extend its regional growth and the research use only market and penetrate the clinical end market globally. Contribution mix of these businesses are expected to yield flat year-over-year adjusted operating margins for the total company for most of the year. The exception is the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, where the comparison of prior year include the stub year portion of ACD, as it was purchased August 1 of last year. The inclusion of August this year will add approximately $3 million of operating costs and very little revenue when compared to last year, thus negatively impacting year-over-year margins during our first quarter. That concludes my prepared comments. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Christina to open the line for some questions. Operator : Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Dan Arias with Citi. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey, good morning. Thank you. Jim, just wanted to start on the outlook for the year. 6% organic for 2018, it seems like it should include 200 basis points or so from ACD as it rolls in. So if I just look at the rest of the business and the implied 4% organic rate there for the remaining portion of the business, it doesn't really seem like it captures the momentum that you have in areas like PPD, et cetera. So can you just maybe walk through your thought there, walk through the segments in order to get to the full-year forecast? And then talk to whether that's conservative or not conservative. James T. Hippel - Bio-Techne Corp.: Actually I'll start from my comments, Dan. So the comment which you're referring to our core business excluding ACD, so the 6% organic growth that we experienced here in fiscal year 2017 is on par with what we expect with our core business going forward excluding ACD. And then ACD a couple of percentage points of growth on top of that. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: So we're not coming off... Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: ...our thesis of being an 8% or better, so... Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. So just to clarify, 6% organic for the rest of the business if we were to assume somewhere in the neighborhood of 200 basis points from ACD, you're looking at the 8% range that Chuck just referenced? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Correct. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Jim also referenced, there could be some minor shifts up or down. We've got a scale issue that's getting bigger PPD, so it might be a few points off. We've been averaging almost near mid-20s lately. So we're not promising that in PPD. And Diagnostics should be \u2013 could be little higher. We've got a pretty good full pipeline of things coming in. We're expecting a solid year with this entry of the PARATEST, to be honest. So a little bit of shifting, but the overall net-net grew, we're guiding really to \u2013 our soft guidance was like last year 6%, total 8%, and that's if ACD stays at 40% or better, which we right now think it should. So... Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yeah, right. I got you. Okay. And so if I could just stay with ACD and Protein Platforms for a minute. On the ACD portfolio, can you just talk a bit about what the imperatives are to keep that growth near 40%? Do you need additional reps as you try to spread the word of the technology, or is the current sales coverage, I mean, what you think it's needed to be? And then on PPD, is it fair to say that the 15%, 20% growth range is still part of the outlook for 2018? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Yes and yes. So number one and always, in an acquisition like an ACD \u2013 remember, we're finishing our earn-out through the end of this calendar year \u2013 it's all about team and team and team. So we need to keep that team, keep them happy, keep them motivated, and keep priming the pump. So we are fuelling them. They are still investing. They are increasing their head count significantly. It is a commercial model. We've talked a lot about. It is not the \u2013 the kid business is not as profitable as our overall proteins business, for example, because you need a lot more commercial activity, because you're dealing with pathologists. And it's a mix between academic and Biopharma, with I would say the trending towards the Biopharma in terms of momentum. So that thesis is in place. We also don't think we have the same kind of issue in terms of early adopters we did with ProteinSimple around the Western blot. It is much more balanced. It's a huge market. There are a lot of pathologists out there. They do all kind of \u2013 act as a bit of a club, so it's a little more uniform than I think we followed the academia around Western blot as an example. So we think that thesis stays strong as or better and there is more coming on top of all the purchases in the Diagnostics segment with the Leica relationship, and then we're not done there too. We're also chasing the other big automation players, and we do think we'll have a nice diagnostic standard here over the coming years as well. Protein Platforms, it's becoming nicely diversified. It's not a one trick pony anymore. It wasn't really purchased for Simple Western. Biologics is actually a larger business. They're all growing double-digit. Biologic growing strong double-digit. Simple Plex is coming up fast. It's 100% growth the last two quarters, 70% or so annualized. We see that continuing. It will become more material this coming year, and we like that. The Milo platform is starting to pick up some steam as \u2013 it was never meant to be a big part of the business, but it is definitely accelerating. So we see a consistent 15% to 20% as well for PPD. It could be better. It all really depends on how strong bioprocessing stays out there, which everybody thinks it will and biologics remaining strong. I do think that the Simple Western will get better and better over time. It's a tough nut to crack to create a new standard out there around Western blotting. It's a $1 billion opportunity and we do see things accelerating. I could say \u2013 tell you that we did have an increase in our consumables, our attach rate this last quarter or two, and so we like to see that. So there is much more acceptance of the platform, but there's still focus on it. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks for the help, Chuck. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Puneet Souda. Puneet Souda - Leerink Partners LLC : Yeah, hi, Chuck, Jim, great quarter. Just briefly on \u2013 let me touch on China, since ACD is somewhat covered. The PrimeGene brand, help me understand, now you have Western products growing there too, Protein Platforms growing and now PrimeGene is adding in. Help us just to understand, I mean, how should we think about China in the context of the guidance that you've already given out? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Well, we'll see China improving. The R&D Systems brand, the core brands have always remained strong, but the \"China for China\" strategy was in a large part due to PrimeGene because we'd already bought it. And with that CFDA crackdown, we went from some material base business in China to virtually zero. That's coming back now, and it's out of our numbers going forward the next quarter. So you'll see overall organic rates improving significantly for the whole China business, but they're going to remain above 20%, 25% in our core brands, and I still hope to actually improve them even further, given the other things we're doing there. And bringing more Diagnostics division products in as well, more and more governance there, expanding into more territories. We're expanding into Beijing. So we're \u2013 it's still an expanding model as a business unit. And I would say we're not even halfway through what we're going to do with China, so... Puneet Souda - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. Got it. And in terms of the iCE platform that you mentioned, having a growth there in Biologics, obviously, so in the QA/QC platform, could you give us a sense of \u2013 we have heard Biologics' weakness is from some of the other competitors in the space, so just trying to reconcile and trying to understand where you're seeing growth specifically in that segment. And if you could elaborate a little bit also on how the academic segment of the Western platform continues to grow and how much of a tail do you have there longer term? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Well, first focusing on bioprocessing and Biologics. We've been watching our other peers announcing and we're really mystified as well, because we're seeing amazing strength yet in the Biologics space. It could be a lot due to the \u2013 we still are seeing a lot of momentum and taking share with our latest platform in the iCE category, with the Maurice platform. And I think that's a big part of it. As I mentioned, we have some customers with as many as 100 instruments. So it is the only part of our business in the company to actually \u2013 it actually supports production in Biopharma. So there is a lot of big scale potential. So as these large companies decide to change out their old platforms, and then stay with the spec of our platform, there's a lot of big upside and we're seeing that. So it's very, very strong double-digit growth. And we've tempered that as much as I say we can here looking forward, but we don't see any real negativity yet. And we are hearing there's a softening in other places as well, but we've not seen it here and I do think it's probably a testimony to the strong share-taking ability of the Maurice platform, because it could handle charge and size, and so it's a direct competitor to some other big guys out there. First time we've had that and it's just really good product. Puneet Souda - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. Great. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: And in terms of Western, I think I mentioned already. It's a slower ramp. We're getting there. It's double digits and what I like \u2013 I think the biggest thing to watch, and we watch is the consumable's attach rate. So it's becoming more and more [used] that we sold them, because remember we're still selling a lot in the academia, as well as Biopharma. In those academia, those are the ones you got to watch, make sure they are using them. So that's happening. We like the improvement and we are double-digit growth. The West is \u2013 I don't have the fun fact number, but we're well north of, I think, 600 or so placements. So on our way to a first 1,000 here probably this coming year easily. Puneet Souda - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. Thanks. And just if I could squeeze in one last one on academics. You pointed out this is low single-digit. Again, being in lab in my past life, just I would assume that, look, consumable orders would go first and the heavy equipment would come a little bit later. So I'm just sort of surprised that you haven't seen the pull through that some of the larger competitors are already seeing from NIH improvement. So help us understand what happened \u2013 what's the dynamic there and what's your thought on 2018 here, fiscal year 2018? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Yeah, I don't think we're saying that. So we were mid-single digits for the year. It was a little softer this quarter, but it bounces around a bit. We're actually seeing some strong growth. I think we are seeing some triple [through] from NIH. I think other companies have mentioned it now, even Thermo. We also had a best quarter in probably six, seven quarters of Fisher. So that's also looking pretty nice. So I'm pretty bullish overall really. I think what you're \u2013 we try to mention that the offset from PrimeGene and some of the OEMs and the timing there also kind of negates from the overall Biotech number. Clearly, you are going to see that kind of bounce around, but we're still bullish on mid-single-digit growth this coming year in the segment. That's all we need. I remember, four years ago coming into this company, we were double-digit negative in academia and shrinking quickly for a lot of reasons, and that's been corrected for years now. And low single-digit overall academia has all ever been our growth and the remaining high single-digit Biopharma, and we're seeing the mix continue in that kind of range. Puneet Souda - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. Thanks, guys. Good. James T. Hippel - Bio-Techne Corp.: Yeah, Puneet. This is Jim. Just one more thing I'll mention, because others obviously listen to lot of our peer calls as well and let me make sure you parcel out and look at the academic growth is whether talking about on a global basis or whether talking about on a U.S. basis. On a global basis, we are solid single mid-digits. Europe is performing very well in academia for us. U.S. is a little bit softer. But I know some of our peers talk about it on a global basis, not necessarily on U.S. basis, so just something to keep in mind. Puneet Souda - Leerink Partners LLC : Got it, guys. Thanks for the details. Good quarter. Thanks. Operator : We'll take our next question from Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you and hello. First off on ACD, Chuck or Jim, can you characterize the level of visibility you have into your 40-plus percent growth expectation for ACD in fiscal 2018? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Well, the visibility is as much as \u2013 they're in an earn-out, but we definitely govern them and there is a lot of process. They are increasing their head count significantly in their commercial, which is really where the increased sales come from, and then we're really ramping with Leice, the Diagnostics platform. So it is still largely a research business model with probably the bigger growth, probably next year, not this year, coming off of Diagnostics. So a lot of growth all the way through going forward, because again this is $1 billion space, and we see the market is a tighter market than like Western blot, because we're really going after pathologists as a class of customers, and the take-up is very strong. I would say it's \u2013 we had a 60% quarter last quarter. This quarter is still over 50%, and overall sort of a 6% year. We're not seeing any slowdown yet. We're just saying we're not promising more than 40%. We're not seeing an acceleration either. I think the take-up is about as good as we can feed the beast, so to speak, with additional commercial resources. And you can go too fast in this, and we're trying to caution and we're involved really at all levels, and with leadership and with compensation. And this is a Silicon Valley based business unit, of course, so you've got to mind too, there are other companies out there that buy for talent, as you know. So it's what we do. We're operators, so we're operating. Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then my follow-up question, Chuck. Can you elaborate on what changed with the Fisher relationship? It seemed like the performance changed, your tone changed, and something \u2013 it sounds like you've got an extension to that relationship now as well. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Well, Fisher is a complicated animal, and we know it well, obviously, from our background, and the leadership are good friends of us here personally as well, so we're all trying. Of course, so you're talking about a model that has dozens and dozens of reps in the field and how do we support them the right way, how to keep them focused on academia versus Biopharma, where we're already strong, how to keep their technical specialists really up-to-date and trained as they have turnover. These have all been issues the last couple of years. And I would say we really dug in hard. I think I mentioned this last quarter, we were digging hard on those issues, especially training, and it's kind of paid off. They had a solid upper mid-single-digit growth quarter for us, and I hope it continues. We are extending the relationship, but of course, there are metrics they must meet to continue that, and they are, if anything, drifting towards being more of a competitor with their acquisitions via Thermo Fisher, so it's something we have to watch. It's not as carefree and friendly as it was four years ago when they didn't own and they didn't own Life Tech, of course. So it is what it is, but we firsthand know that the firewall there is real and that they take it very seriously, and we believe in them and we are \u2013 we do have processes in place where reps must work together in the field and support each other and that works and it is working, and I think that's been one of the improvements in the quarter, things that have improved. Overall, at a high level, they're just more attention and focused. They don't want to lose us. We've become a pretty big customer of theirs overall, and I'd like to see it continuing work, plain and simple. We would like to focus more on Biopharma and really let them focus on academia for us, because they've got the army we don't. Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: No, understood, thanks for all the color. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Catherine Schulte with Robert W. Baird. Emily G. Stent - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. This is actually Emily on for Catherine. So turning a little bit more towards the antibody markets, how would you characterize the current competitive landscape within antibodies, and how has this changed since Santa Cruz antibodies came off the market last December? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: It's a great question. I was hoping that somebody would ask this one. So we've had \u2013 we had a really great year and quarter in antibodies. We attribute a lot of it to \u2013 most of it to our website overhaul, where we're getting double-digit traffic increases. This is largely a search engine kind of a model, and when you're dealing with couple hundred thousand products like we are, it's important really to be careful. Novus has double-digit growth, and Europe even stronger. It's doing well on all cylinders. It's been a wonderful acquisition. The team has been wonderful. They've been the leadership champions of our website overhaul. And they are really infiltrating a lot of the overall governance, and our overall antibody category is doing well. I think we've taken a little bit of that Santa Cruz opportunity. I think it's hard to not see the two of us being in the single digit growth rates as a category and double-digit in a lot of regions like Europe. We're not the only one after that share. Everybody has a program, as you saw Abcam did report and I think that's probably one of the \u2013 you take our [riba] monoclonals, that's probably the most average looking report they've done in years and, in fact, they were no better than us. So we're very happy with our progress as an antibody supplier. As you know, it's a very, very big market. It's just also very, very fragmented and we're still looking at strategies, assets, other combinations of instant platforms and work streams to give us an edge. We are probably the leading manufacturer of antibodies that actually provides full solutions that has instruments to go with the platform. I think you'll see other competitors there try to copy that, so it's working, and we're all in on antibodies, what can I say. And then we think we're perfectly positioned. I mean, the future \u2013 there is a lot coming on on immunotherapeutics using antibodies and we're also posting IP now. You can start looking that up, where we're starting to discover antibodies around certain binding ligands and the potential molecule. So we're \u2013 we've got a lot of discovery going as well in turning around antibodies. So more to come on that. Emily G. Stent - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks. That's very helpful. And then turning more towards M&A, so I know in the past you've traditionally averaged about three deals a year. I haven't really seen one this year other than ACD. Going forward, are you still targeting deals related to Diagnostics, China, and Europe? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Yes, yes, and yes. So we didn't have any less activity. We just didn't have as much to show for it. As everyone will attest to, deals \u2013 it's a pretty hot market, deals are not cheap right now and we're just very rigorous on our process. So if we don't find a way \u2013 a path through synergies to get to a double-digit return on that capital within five years, we usually walk. It's getting harder and harder to do. We do focus more on the private entity more than a public entity. We're not really in the processes of \u2013 more and more deals go into process. So that doesn't say that we aren't \u2013 we're focused on looking at lot of things. We made comments that we'd do probably one to three this year. I feel very confident we'll do one to three this year. And, yes, we did go whole year without acquisitions and a couple of years ago the questions were a lot about, are we doing too many and do we know what we're doing. And so, yes, we even know how to take a pause and focus on integration. And look at the operations, look at the margin, look at what we've done, I mean, the results are there, they're showing it. We had two wonderful quarters in a row of some really great productivity and is showing that we're really finding that integration \u2013 synergies that we're looking for. So, more to come. We are on track for our strat plan. We do think without any acquisitions, we'll be at that 41% in the couple more years out. And we won't be there next quarter, so don't add 2 points on for next quarter. As Jim mentioned, it's going to be up and down and the overall mix component for next year is roughly flattish. But the trend is there, it's real and we know what we're doing on this. But all likelihood, we will do acquisitions and so we will take a step back if we can do the dilution, and then we'll keep grinding on like we do \u2013 we know how to do. Again, this is a team of people who are all very experienced operators and we like doing it, so... Emily G. Stent - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks so much. Operator : We'll take our next question from Amanda Murphy with William Blair. Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. I just had a couple of questions on some of the end market dynamics you already talked about. I guess one was on the academic side in the U.S., so clearly seeing a little bit better there as you talked about. It sounds like we're also seeing some people starting to look forward to 2018 and what may go on there. So I was just curious what you're hearing from customers in terms of their willingness to spend this year versus uncertainty next year. Go ahead, sorry. Go ahead. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Go ahead. I just don't want to stack up too many questions, I won't be able to answer them all. Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC: No, no, no. Go ahead. Yeah. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: So I'm going to start this, and I'm going to let Jim take this because he's actually just been kind of rolling through our numbers, because there's always been a lot of focus on what do we really have in academic versus Biopharma and U.S. versus the world, and what are the trends and how are we mitigating that academic risk. And so we have a fresh set of numbers so to speak. I would say the coming year, I think things look pretty good for NIH funding from what we hear, and what we've seen, and I don't think we've seen everything really come through. There's still kind of a trepidation out there over \u2013 politically. So I think we're not even midway into that. Other companies have talked about that. This is the first quarter I'm really seeing people actually talking about they're seeing some stuff flowing through. I think it will be okay that part. Biopharma is still for us, I think, might be a little unique. We do have some timing issues, because a big part of our business in our core, of course, is ELISA kit and assay related and those can go up and down versus the timing of products in Biopharma. We're very strong in that timing cycle in Europe, still we see that continuing. And we hope when we're coming out of that weaker cycle here in the U.S., as Jim mentioned, but there is no proof as of yet, which is what we think is probably going to happen. And with that, Jim can follow up and give some metrics. James T. Hippel - Bio-Techne Corp.: Yeah. I mean, really now and I'll add \u2013 we've mentioned this point before is that the academic portion of our business that's strictly U.S. related on a global basis, total company revenue basis, it's about 15% of our total revenues. So it has become a much smaller peak dynamic for us. And, yeah, I think we're hearing from our commercial teams out in the field is that the mood is not as negative as it perhaps was in terms of pessimistic about what future funding might look like. I haven't seen it come through yet in big dollars or orders. But one of the items we look at are some of the smaller customers we have that are truly government agencies as opposed to academic institutions that perhaps take longer to see the funds or get the grants approved. And those specific government agencies did see a nice uptick this last quarter. So we're hoping that's kind of a forecast for what we'll see in broader academic going forward. I cut you off, so keep going. Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC: I was going to ask about the CFDA, just any sense of when we might see some relief on that front. James T. Hippel - Bio-Techne Corp.: We're seeing relief already. It's \u2013 as I mentioned last quarter, we were over there. We met with them actually, and kind of got a good view on just how they look at this, how serious is it, how are they dealing with it, what's their manpower like to deal because there's a lot of hospitals in China that were in the business of immunotherapeutics, and then in selling online, even and advertising for it. So they're grinding through it. They increased their resources to dealing with it. And they are starting to trickle out now and so certifications are happening, so our business is coming back. But it's going to take couple of years. It's not going to be over anytime soon. I think the biggest issue for us is it will be annualized \u2013 the hit will be annualized out of our numbers here going forward. And with the strong growth in rest of our business, we'll start seeing good growth rate numbers, and then we'll pick up that piece. We're also focusing PrimeGene on more than just that category for China, there is lot other areas to focus on as a fighter brand there for customers and many customers don't want to [roll] the full cost and quality of R&D Systems brand, and then there is an OEM component to the business global that we use that factory for and it is a GMP factory. It's a beautiful factory and we're going to work on keeping it full. So there is really three components to \u2013 when you're building that business back, where immunotherapeutics locally changes one of them, okay. Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. And can I just ask one more on op margin? So, obviously, you put up a pretty nice improvement in ACD. I was just wondering if you could get a little more detail around kind of what you're doing there, and then I don't think you said what your thoughts were on that front for 2018 just more broadly for the company around op margin. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Yeah, there is lot of timing, there is lot of productivity. We had really strong cash flow on operations here. So a lot of things contributed this quarter. We were nicely surprised it did as well as it did, but there is good reasons. The productivity is not slowing down here, even though we are a pretty profitable business in this area, everyone knows how lean this business has been historically and we're improving a lot of systems. I'll give you an example, this coming year, we don't have a LIMS system here. We don't include any LIMS and that could provide a lot more productivity even further taking out a lot of paper process here. So there is more to come. We're really on track for our thesis to getting back to 41% in a no-acquisitions forward scenario. How we get there is going to be a little up and down. It won't be straight up, and Jim mentioned that in his comments, and he can comment further here on the mix for this coming year and make sure you guys are all clear on how that mix looks. James T. Hippel - Bio-Techne Corp.: Yeah. I mean, we said all this year that the immediate impact of ACD is going to be quite severe to our margins, and then we clawed ourselves back throughout the back half of the year, which we did. And now going forward from here, it's kind of \u2013 a lot is in our base line and so ACD is still going to require a lot of investment to fuel 40% type kind of growth. That doesn't just happen without a lot of investment typically in the commercial resource side. They've got a lot of runway ahead of them geographically and expanding their markets. So that's going to require lot of investment. We do expect it will be profitable. It will be modestly profitable. But when you see where the heavy growth is coming from, which is on the ACD side, to a lesser extent, there's still solid growth on our Protein Platforms segment, they still have by far the lowest operating margin profile of our three segments. And thus you have a negative mix headwind when you blend it all together, and that's what we expect to see going forward at least for the immediate year. Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Thanks. You're welcome. Operator : We'll take our next question from Matt Hewitt with Craig-Hallum. Matthew G. Hewitt - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC : Good morning. Congratulations on a strong quarter and just one question from me. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Okay, Matt. Matthew G. Hewitt - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC : Just wanted to circle back to your comments earlier regarding Maurice in Europe. It sounds like you've been taking share there. I'm just curious, and I don't even know if you have these type of metrics, but where do you think you are today from a market share perspective and how should we think about that over the next couple of years as you continue to drive growth there? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Yeah. So a couple of things. We've asked the same questions, because buying into the company, we thought the Western blot process is $1 billion, $1.5 billion kind of opportunity, and the Biologics market was roughly $0.5 billion kind of opportunity, which we had a significant share with the iCE platform already. We do think it is significantly more than $0.5 billion opportunity, and it isn't just looking forward. You got to remember Biopharma, when they lock in and spec a process introduction, they don't like to change it, right. So, you're always buying with looking forward versus what can you switch looking backwards. And we're getting some pretty good pickup overall, because the platform is so strong functionally, and it's just a good value, a good value overall with the consumables and everything else. So we're getting share there as well. So the way I look forward I think is that it should stay strong double-digit here, I think, for a couple of years. We'll, of course, have new versions of the platform coming out. It is right now the biggest part of the Protein Platforms division. It was about in that \u2013 close to that when we bought the company really, but we just didn't see such a strong uptick. We saw a good move forward, because it was the first new platform in five years in that category of iCE, but it's just been doing well. And I got to mention too that, we're seeing a lot of strong pickup in Asia because of biosimilars, so we're starting to get spec'ed in a lot of processes we are involved in. The big example is the big Samsung factory, of course. And we are focused on other areas, China and India. Then growth in Europe has also been strong double-digit and so nice surprises there. And we are similarly taking share from our largest competitor, which is a much larger company than us and well-known in space. So I hope it continues. We think it will for at least a year or two. Matthew G. Hewitt - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Tim Evans from Wells Fargo. Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hey, thank you. Just wanted to clarify some of the math on the outlook. Jim, if I think of ACD growing north of 40% next year, if I'm doing my math right, that would actually contribute pretty close to 3% to the consolidated top line. Are you just maybe baking in a little bit of conservatism there or am I thinking about that wrong? James T. Hippel - Bio-Techne Corp.: I haven't done the exact math, but the math I showed does show much closer to 2% than 3%. So... Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. James T. Hippel - Bio-Techne Corp.: I can run through the detail with you later offline, but I do show 2%. Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: I don't think our math shows that. Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Oh, okay. All right. Maybe I have it wrong. And then looking at the \u2013 you talked about maybe a little bit softer growth in Protein. So if I \u2013 just back of the envelope, if I call that something like mid-teens and I call ACD 40%, I'd be looking at the rest of the business something at like 4%, I think. Is that how you're thinking about it and is that what you kind of see as kind of the longer-term trajectory for the rest of the business? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: It's a backward thing. So we're \u2013 as a category, it's a mid-single-digit growth, so that's 4% to 6%. Just as a temper for this coming quarter, Q1, we were an 8% quarter last year in this area. We've been as low as 2% twice this past year, two quarters ago and this quarter. So it's a 4% to 6% kind of net, and this is with strong antibodies. We had a roughly flattish year in immunoassay as we talked about because a lot of the timing issue the big pharma you think could bounce back. And then, Protein, pretty stable, but pretty stable in that 4-ish range. And we're by far the leading share maker of the proteins, and we're focusing much more on upstream. The hardest to make, where we can raise prices, really go after that quality and that name brand of R&D Systems that we're known for. And you got to offset all that erosion at the commodity level. The products have been around for 20 years and we do have competition, because the stuff is profitable and is largely trade secrets. So it's really all about our defense strategy and working upstream is best we can. So I will tell you that the new products that we are generating within proteins are roughly near 10% type of grower, nearly double-digit, but there is offset at the low end, right, at the commodity level, where the competition sits some cases one-third our price. So it's a difficult strategy to pull off to try and get a net of 5%, 6% when you have that kind of fragmentation within your portfolio. And yet we have to figure out the way to do it. We are working \u2013 obviously, this is a big part that we focus on with Fisher, of course. We are also working with how to deal with the special pricing, special arrangements, special deals with academia in general. We are working on how to scale a big pharma, of course, on agreements that go beyond proteins to try and put more in the bag. So all these things matter, of course, and we hope is a net of 4-ish, 5-ish in proteins and as a category within Biotech division mid-single-digit. But I think fairly safe, I mean, we're much more controlled with them than were a few years ago. Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you.

I'll now turn the call over to Chuck. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter conference call. As you saw in our press release, we started fiscal year 2018, just as we finished last year, on a strong note and well on our way to executing on our strategic plan. The company delivered 8% organic growth in the quarter and our two divisions that primarily serve the life science research market, Biotechnology and Protein Platforms, collectively grew organically by over 9%. Especially encouraging, the growth we saw in Q1 was broad-based in both geography and product category. Europe continued to deliver outstanding results with Q1 organic growth in the low-teens. Within Europe, growth was also broad-based with solid contribution from both our reagent and instrument product categories. All major countries in Europe experienced growth in both the academic and BioPharma end markets growing double-digit in the region. With new leadership established last year, along with an acquisition of our most loyal distributor in Southern Europe, we embarked on creating a more unified European subsidiary, with attention to cross-selling and regional collaboration. We believe this model's working. As in Europe, our Asia region also broadly delivered outstanding results. In China, growth of our Western brands again grew over 30% in Q1, just as they had in Q4. Japan is experiencing growth in a big way, growing over 20% in Q1, while the rest of APAC reported growth of nearly 30%. It's gratifying to see the regional subsidiaries trying to one-up each other every quarter. I am very proud of the leadership and commercial teams we have in our region. They are executing at an exceptional level. Here in the U.S., we started the year with mid-single-digit growth in both our academic and BioPharma end markets. We saw an uptick in the academic projects that coincided with the release of NIH funding that has been widely reported on, which gave us a modest acceleration from the low-single-digit growth rates we've seen in the U.S. academic market for a long time now. The BioPharma market in the U.S. was stable in Q1, though not as strong as we are seeing in Europe and elsewhere. We believe project timing is still impacting some of the larger U.S. pharma companies, but long-term the trend is still upward. Now, for some color on our Q1 performance by division. Our Biotech division grew 6% organically in Q1, with the core reagent product categories collectively growing around 3% and ACD growing north of 40%. Within Biotech's core products, antibodies continued to excel as a category with our R&D Systems brand growing in the high-single digits and our Novus branded antibodies growing a remarkable 30%. One of our key growth strategies has been expanding our antibody portfolio and investing in our web capabilities in order to provide the vast amount of data on the performance of antibodies that researchers demand before making their purchase. As Q1 and most of last year has shown, that strategy is bearing fruit. And finally, this past August, we celebrated the one-year anniversary of Advanced Cell Diagnostics being part of the Bio-Techne family. This means that two months worth of ACD sales were included in the Biotech's division's organic growth rate. Although still a relatively small part of the Biotech division, at a 40% growth rate it won't be small for long. We see a long runway of revenue growth ahead for ACD as the pathologists continue to appreciate and continue its RNA in situ hybridization transformative technology. The clinical diagnostic markets for ACD's products are just beginning to be tapped and we've barely started in China yet. We believe the best is still yet ahead for ACD, especially once full integration with the rest of the company is complete by end of the fiscal year. We continued to bolster our Biotech reagent portfolio with the acquisition of Trevigen in early September. We are very familiar with the Trevigen product line, having sold it for many years through our own sales channels. Trevigen products enable researchers to better understand cell behavior and genotoxic events on cells, and complement our current product portfolio. Having tools to study DNA damage and the apoptotic cell process is an important aspect of understanding drug action. Drug testing is increasingly becoming conducted on physiological cell models, including 3D cell cultures, and Trevigen's Cultrex product line supports the robust growth of such cells, making these products an important addition to the Bio-Techne portfolio. Trevigen will be a nice tuck-in acquisition for us. Organically, we continue to focus on product innovation vitality with hundreds of new proteins and antibodies developed and released for sale every quarter. This quarter, I would like to highlight a few new product releases that highlight our leadership and assays. In Q1, we launched a new XL Cytokine Discovery Luminex Performance Panel, which has the capability to simultaneously measure 45 different analytes in a variety of sample types. Our product category of multiplex assay grew 25% in Q1. And with new product launches like XL Cytokine Discovery, we see runway for future double-digit growth as we capture market share. In September, we also released a new rapid ELISA design to measure anti-Zika virus, immunoglobulin G antibodies in human serum. A unique feature of this assay is that, prior to performing the test, samples are pre-treated with a proprietary reagent designed to minimize any interfering proteins present in the serum which could produce a false positive result. It will be particularly useful for researchers that are testing samples collected from areas where Zika virus and dengue virus co-circulate, since the assay will clearly distinguish between the two viruses and will eliminate the likelihood of a false positive. Furthermore, since approximately 80% of the individuals infected with the Zika virus don't realize that they are infected and IgG antibodies persist for such a long time following infection, this kit can be used to detect prior infections and determine whether the Zika virus may be linked to subsequent neurological disorders or fetal abnormalities. We recognize the need for more research to understand the biology of emerging viruses like Zika and are proud to contribute to this field. Also in September, we launched an expansion of the Ella immunoassay platform with a 32x4 Simple Plex cartridge. This new cartridge simultaneously measures up to 32 different samples against four different analytes of interest, doubling the current sample throughput while maintaining a total immunoassay time of 85 minutes. The Ella platform, coupled with our new 32x4 Simple Plex cartridge, meets the continued request of our global immunoassay customer base to deliver solutions that enable higher throughput immunoassays while maintaining high sensitivity and ease-of-use not offered by other products in the market. Speaking of Ella, I'll now move on to Protein Platforms. This division with 25% organic growth in Q1 is executing really well, now marking the seventh quarter in a row with double-digit organic growth, six out of seven of those with growth over 20% or better. All four of the division's major product categories, Biologics, Simple Western, Simple Plex and Single-Cell Western, grew more than 20% in the quarter, with both Simple Plex and Single-Cell Western growing over 100%. A dedicated sales effort focused on multiplex type assays is really paying dividends by way of Simple Plex instrument and cartridge sales, and academic markets in the U.S. are already starting to embrace Milo, our Single-Cell Western instrument. As we have said many times before, the markets for Protein Platforms product solutions are collectively approaching $2 billion and we still have less than 5% share. Thus, there is plenty of runway for continued double-digit growth well into the future. Next, our Diagnostics division had a decent quarter, considering the lumpy nature of this OEM business, as we have discussed in the past. Two out of three major product categories, hematology and glucose controls, experienced growth in the mid- to-high-single digits, showing that end-user demand is strong for these products. Business with our Chinese OEM customers is especially strong. However, the timing of orders for both Diagnostic components continues to swing their short-term organic growth recorded for the division. You will recall that this division grew 19% in the prior-year quarter when the timing of these orders was more favorable, so a tough comp in Q1 of this year. There is no change to our intermediate and long-term view of this business. The project pipeline for our Diagnostics division remains very strong with new markets to serve. Plans are on their way to expand our subsidiary model in Europe to include the Diagnostics division and drive new opportunities with customers there, further expanding our sales funnel. Finally, I would like to comment on our adjusted operating margin performance in Q1. We've been very transparent over the past year about what kind of initial impact the acquisition was going to have on our margins. We explained at the end of last quarter that ACD had crossed over into profitability for the first time in Q4, and the first quarter of fiscal 2018 would be the last quarter of margin headwind at the total company level associated with this transaction, which closed in August of last year. While we did experience an approximate 100-basis-point year-on-year headwinds to adjusted operating margin due to the stub-period ownership of ACD last year, I am happy to report that ACD continued to ramp in profitability, achieving 12% operating margin in Q1. This puts ACD ahead of its plan on profitability and provides more evidence of just how quickly ACD will continue to the bottom line of the company as it continues to scale. Overall, the first quarter was a great start to what we believe will be a great year among many more ahead as we proceed and execute into our strategic plan. With that, I will turn the call over to Jim, who will provide more details on our financial performance for the quarter. Jim? James T. Hippel - Bio-Techne Corp.: Thanks, Chuck. I'll provide an overview of our Q1 financial performance for the total company, and then I'll provide some color on each of our three segments. Starting with the overall first quarter financial performance, adjusted EPS increased 7% to $0.90, while GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.42 compared to $0.50 in the prior year. The decrease in GAAP EPS was attributable to a fair market value adjustment made to the earn-out liability for ACD. As the likelihood of payment on the earn-out increases, the fair market value of the earn-out liability also increases, and that change is reflected as a charge in P&L for GAAP purposes. Management views earn-out payments as part of the acquisition price and valuation paid to the target company, and therefore, exclude these charges as well as other acquisition-related costs from our reported adjusted earnings. Q1 reported revenue was $144.6 million, an increase of 11% year-over-year, with organic revenue increasing 8%. Fourth quarter reported sales include the 2% growth contribution from acquisitions and a 1% contribution from favorable foreign exchange translation. By geography, the U.S. grew mid-single digits, with both Biopharma and academia growing in the mid-single digits. Europe's organic growth was in the low-teens, with Biopharma's sales growth in the low-teens and academia up 10%. China's organic growth was nearly 20% in the first quarter, with our Western brand growing over 30%. Japan had a very strong quarter with growth over 20%, while the rest of the Asia-Pac region excelled with nearly 30% growth. Note that all references made to growth rate by region and end market exclude our OEM sales, which mostly occur in our Diagnostics segment and, to a lesser extent, our Biotech segment. Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin was 72.1% in Q1, favorable approximately 110 basis points from the prior year, driven by volume leverage and favorable product mix. Foreign exchange helped adjusted gross margin by approximately 30 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted SG&A in Q1 was 27.4% of revenue, 255 basis points higher than last year. The SG&A increase was driven by the acquisition of ACD in August of last year and, to a lesser extent, strategic investments made in our core businesses to support growth. R&D expense in Q1 was 9.4% of revenue, down 40 basis points from prior year. The resulting adjusted operating margin for Q1 was 35.3%, a decrease of 105 basis points from the prior-year period. Looking at our numbers below operating income, net interest expense in Q1 was $2.1 million, compared to $1.4 million of net interest expense last year. The higher interest expense is due to a $400 million line of credit, which was opened in August of last year to replace our previous $150 million line of credit as well as to fund the acquisition of ACD. Other non-operating expense for the quarter was $0.9 million, compared to only $18,000 in the prior-year quarter. The higher expense in the current period was associated with transactional FX expense caused by the rapid rise of the Canadian dollar in Q1 and its impact to our cash and open current accounts from our operations in Ontario. Our adjusted effective tax rate in Q1 was 29.3%, an improvement of 210 basis points in the first quarter of last year due to geographic mix. In terms of returning capital, we continue to pay our dividend, and paid out $12 million in the quarter. Average diluted shares were up less than 1% over the year-ago period at 37.7 million shares outstanding. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. $44.4 million of cash was generated from operations in the first quarter and our investment in capital expenditures was $5.3 million. We also made approximately $47 million in M&A investment during the quarter, associated with the CyVek earn-out and, to a lesser extent, the acquisition of Trevigen. As for other notable items in our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a $122.7 million of cash and short-term available-for-sale investments. Our long-term debt obligations at the end of Q1 stood at $337.5 million, down $6 million from the end of Q4. Going forward, our capital deployment priorities remain opportunistic M&A, our dividend and debt pay-down. Now I'll discuss the performance of our three business segments, starting with the Biotechnology segment. Q1 reported sales were $95.1 million, with reported revenue increasing 10%. Acquisitions contributed 3% to revenue growth, foreign exchange contributed 1%, and organic growth was 6%, led by our ACD and antibody product lines. Adjusted operating income for the Biotech segment was $2 million higher in Q1 compared to the prior year, and adjusted operating margin was 46.9%, a decrease of 210 basis points year-over-year. The decrease from prior year is due to the stub-period acquisition of ACD in August of last year. Turning to the Protein Platforms segment. Net sales in Q1 were $24.6 million, an organic increase of 25% from the prior-year period, with currency translation having a favorable impact of 1%. Growth for the division was broad-based in all major product lines and regions. Adjusted operating income in Q1 for the Protein Platforms segment was $3.1 million, representing an adjusted operating margin of 12.4%, an increase of over 1,100 basis points from the prior year. Strong volume leverage and favorable product mix drove the year-over-year improvement, partially offset by strategic growth investments. Moving on to our Diagnostics segment, reported revenue in Q1 was $25 million, with reported inorganic growth increasing 3% from the prior year. Our short-cycle OEM hematology controls and glucose controls businesses experienced mid- to high-single-digit growth, indicating the end markets are strong. However, our longer cycle and thus lumpier Diagnostic component business faced a difficult comp to last year, and the timing of orders gave the overall division 19% growth. Adjusted operating margin for the segment in Q1 was 23.3%, a decrease of 270 basis points from the prior year. The decrease was driven by unfavorable product mix. In summary, for the quarter, our breadth of growth was large, both in terms of end markets and product lines. We continue to prudently invest back in the business, especially to fuel the growth of our game-changing ACD and Protein Platforms product lines. Even with this investment, these businesses rapidly expanded in profitability and double-digit operating margins should be the norm for them going forward. The total company's adjusted operating margin contracted by 100 basis points from last year, but solely due to the stub-period ownership of ACD last year. Going forward, ACD will be included 100% in our baseline for quarterly year-over-year comparison. Our view for the remainder of the year has not changed from a quarter ago. We expect the overall company organic growth for fiscal year 2018 to be consistent with what we saw in Q1. With regard to profitability in fiscal year 2018, Q1 played out as we expected in our last earnings call, and our expectations for the remainder of the year have not changed. While we expect to continue to see rapid year-over-year operating margin expansion in our fastest growing businesses, ACD and Protein Platforms, the overall operating margin contribution from these businesses is still lower than the company average. Thus, this mix will pressure overall company adjusted operating margins to be relatively flat to the prior year for the remainder of fiscal year 2018. That concludes my prepared comments. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Gwen to open the line for some questions. Operator : Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners. Puneet Souda - Leerink Partners LLC : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So, Chuck, maybe if you could start on Europe and it's been a strong one for a number of companies here. Just trying to understand the sustainability of growth there and especially among the different segments that you're seeing growth. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Sure, Puneet. Thanks for the question. So we've had a pretty strong year for going on a year now before really there's any other companies kind of reporting on it. So they're a little bit catching up there. So we've continued to see it. We've classified it as due to execution. We did a lot of changes a little over a year ago and they're really paying off. We have a full subsidiary model in place. We bought out our Southern distributor, allowed us to really work other countries, Spain and others included, and to get the divisions working together, a lot of cross-selling, a lot of cross-learning together. And so now we've grown, I guess, the sales force about double. And when you consider ACD now coming on top of that, it'll be more improved. I think overlaying all that is we had timing kind of go our way with Biopharma going on a-year-and-a-half, two years ago, mainly Germany, and that remains strong. So, with good project timing, good assay sales, where we have more erosion with ELISA here in the U.S., we're very strong in Europe still. I think there are strong results in both our reagents business there and core antibodies in particular. Our Novus is over 30% growth there. And then, the Protein Platforms is a 30% grower, is kind of a new business there in Europe. It all adds up to double-digit, teens growth. And we see that going forward at least for the foreseeable future to be honest, so. Puneet Souda - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. That's helpful. So, one quick one on ACD. You highlighted that you're getting into some of the diagnostic and clinical operations. So, could you give us a sense of how should we think about that? And from more of an operating margin perspective, those labs are a little bit more cost-conscious compared to the Biopharma labs that are more interested in R&D and focused more on sensitivity. So, maybe could you give us a sense of that? And then maybe just lastly, on overall operating margins, we're getting the sense that it is \u2013 I mean, you're expecting flat, but shouldn't that continue to improve, given the improvements that you've seen in operating margins already and the fact that ACD is now part of the company itself? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Yeah. Sure. So, first off, I guess I'll go back to \u2013 we'll see roughly flat our margin because of the mix changes, as the small businesses that are rising rapidly and their improvements are still smaller and they're offsetting the core business. So, Jim has stated many times as well, it's roughly flat. It'll kind of hockey-stick up on two to three years out. So we're still on our strategic plan to get back to roughly a 41% later, so. But this year will remain largely flattish or so, because of the mix change. Now, if we over-exceed like this quarter with strong results, basically we could improve on that. But we'd have to continue to see further improvements basically of ahead of their plan, so to speak. And we're throttling it, so to speak, too. We're investing heavily in this business. So we can kind of pick just how much margin we want to see fall through. So we're trying to pick a mid-single-digit to roughly double-digit in that range, because we wanted to invest heavily back in the business. There's a lot of investment, but head count (22:18) will be over double from when we bought it already. So, growing rapidly. Hard to fuel a 40-plus-percent grower, so. And what was your first question again on that? Puneet Souda - Leerink Partners LLC : Yeah. Just on the diagnostic and clinical labs, and how penetrated are you there in the ACD right now? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: So it's largely still RNA scope of the product. Now we have a deal with an HPV improved assay with Leica, and Leica is motivated and out-selling, but it's still very small in terms of the mix. Going forward, as it grows and we make this platform into a companion diagnostic, margins will remain very strong. It's an 80% gross margin business overall. But I don't think \u2013 it's hard to really analyze right now how much lower it'll be than the current business, but not very far off, we don't think. Puneet Souda - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. James T. Hippel - Bio-Techne Corp.: Yeah. I'd just add that, what small hit there might be to the gross margin, the scale of that business will still help expand the overall operating margin over time. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: The biggest hit may be just from paying Leica. So we'll see how that goes. Puneet Souda - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. Got it. Thanks, guys. Very helpful. Operator : And we'll go next to Dan Arias with Citi. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Thank you. Chuck, Protein Platforms is pretty strong relative to our model this quarter. Can you just touch on where you're seeing the incremental momentum from a customer's perspective? Is it increased pharma penetration or are you finding that you're making some additional headway on the academic side? And then, if I look at comps for the rest of the year in that segment, it looks like you get a little easier next quarter and then you're in line with the 1Q in the back half. So I guess any reason why a 20% growth number wouldn't be sustainable going forward this year? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Well, we think it's very sustainable going forward. So, and as you pointed out, this next quarter is our weakest comp all year, so looking for a good one with them. But 25% this quarter, we're elated with it. Where it's coming from? It's broad-based, it's Biopharma as well as academia. The Biologics area is still a 30% grower, doing really well business. Nice to see the Milo, the Single-Cell platform, starting to take off finally, 100% growth but on a very small base. And Simple Plex also over 100%, and starting to be less than us \u2013 starting to grow and not be so small anymore. So we're on track there. And I think a nice surprise was we had probably the best quarter in a while with our Simple Western and consumable-driven. So we have a low-double-digit growth in the platform but over 20% overall growth in the category because consumables are really doing well. And that simply means that people are using the machines, and we love that, so. Once you go Simple Western, you don't go back to the hand and methodology. So, very exciting to see that all four platforms are growing extremely well. And to your point, I see no reason why we shouldn't be at 20%-plus grower for the foreseeable future. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you. Okay. And then maybe just on the Diagnostics segment. I mean, how are you feeling about visibility there right now? Obviously that's a lumpy business, just given the revenue concentration. And are you finding that the inventory work down is more in line with expectations and a bit more predictable? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Yeah. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: And then, on the margin line, I guess, just curious how you should be thinking about profitability of that segment, just given some of the things going on there, glucose pricing, et cetera? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: All right. First on \u2013 there's four different platforms in that division and they are virtually all on plan for this quarter for us. Now, we have some continued lumpiness of some accounts. We have one big account that's of almost $1 million. It's just delayed. And it's not with the San Marcos business, which was the usual situation. They are actually on plan. Jim and I were just looking over numbers before the call just to see \u2013 we had 19% quarter last year, it was a pretty good quarter. And we weren't particularly strong in a couple of segments. We were wondering just how strong San Marcos was and they're up 77%. So it's a pretty tough comp for them this quarter to be going against 77% growth. So, that kind of explains that. So, overall, we see San Marcos looking better. It was a tough fiscal year last year, definitely a better one this year. The pipeline \u2013 the reasons we bought these assets are starting to deliver and we see more filling. We are adding people both in Europe and Asia now and actually start taking the division into those subsidiaries. It's been kind of a U.S.-centric OEM model and there's more we can do in Europe, in Asia and now Americas, coming up here in the coming couple of weeks here in Europe. And we go over there and do a lot of pipe filling for deals, and we'll have better support and more people than ever this year. So we're kind of all about growing this category in Europe this coming year. And the big accounts that we've talked about supporting this business are really kind of get it back on track. So, mid-single digit growth this year is where we see it and where we expect it to be, and I think it'll be a better year than last year. And then I'm going to have Jim comment on the margin profile going forward. James T. Hippel - Bio-Techne Corp.: Yeah. On the margin side, so the San Marcos business that Chuck referred to, our Diagnostic component piece of our business being the lumpiest, but it also has the highest contribution margin of our four major pieces of that business. And so, when there's a high shipment quarter, you get some great pull-through from that. When there's a lower one, you suffer from it. So, hence the lumpiness in the margins kind of follow the lumpiness of that piece of the business. So how I would think about the margin in general is how they were for all of last year. That's how they should pretty much play out by the end of this year, as those orders move out throughout the rest of the quarter. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Super. Jim, can I just sneak in one last one? How many bps do you think the weather cost you this quarter? James T. Hippel - Bio-Techne Corp.: On the top line, I mean, I think it's a few hundred thousand. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: $500,000. James T. Hippel - Bio-Techne Corp.: Yeah. $500,000. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: We did the math expecting a question from you guys. James T. Hippel - Bio-Techne Corp.: About $0.5 million and it's largely academia. We don't have the exposure in Puerto Rico like a fair amount of other people do. It's largely academic. But between Harvey and Irma in Puerto Rico, all told, about $0.5 million, so. And it's run rate stuff we lost at the bench, so. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Right. Very good. Thanks, guys. Operator : And we'll go next to Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. So, first question on the performance in Japan, how much of that would you classify as better end-market environment and how much would you classify as execution? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Great question. And we've been focused in Japan for really a couple years now. We've had dismal results, but we're not the only one. So, having that come back roaring back at 22% we're pretty happy about, and it's really broad-based. First of all, we had a lot of execution help because we've been struggling in the last couple of years of really rationalizing our distributor network there. And you know the Japanese model, master distributors working down to many hundreds of dealers, sub-dealers, and that's how the model works there. And you can have them fighting each other a little too much. So we have that rationalization kind of done this last year and that's now starting to pay off. And then second, finally, long last that we do \u2013 it does appear that funding is being more released in Japan and it's finding its way to us as well as everyone else. We have great instrument products. Our instrument business is doing extremely well there in Japan, helping bolster the whole category, whole company at the 20-plus-percent this quarter. So we hope that continues now. But a nice move in our reagents business as well and I think it's a combination of execution and the market there. Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then for my follow-up, Chuck, can you elaborate on the trends you're seeing in the bio-production market? I know you've talked about the size of your business there is a bit better than folks appreciate and the trends seem to have been rather lumpy for some of your peers in that market. So, any elaboration on that would be helpful. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Yeah. And we've talked about that. Now we think it's somewhere between $60 million and $80 million that we could consider bio-production. Now the good news for us is that the far majority of our bio-production, our instruments that go into the Biologics area, and being it's a hot new product area, we're ramping up. We're not seeing the softness others are reporting on. Maybe we'll later. But I know our growth rates in Biologics is as strong as ever, actually accelerating and the consumables picking up behind that as we build more of an installed base. So, feel pretty good for us. We're nichey in medias and in the areas too, and for us, it's just not that big, where it's not that big a deal. So we're kind of steady as she goes. Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : And we'll go next to Amanda Murphy with William Blair. Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. So I just had a question. You have laid out at your Analyst Day a few targets, one without incremental M&A and one with. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Yeah. Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC: And so, the $850 million that you laid out, I think part of that also included sort of synergies that you could build off the business as it stands today. So I just wanted to go back to that and ask you kind of how do you feel about your ability to check to that number. And can you give some examples of where you're seeing opportunity for synergies, just say from the acquisitions you've done so far? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Well, I think, getting back to Europe again, the synergies are working. We have low-teens growth in Europe, which is pretty outstanding for anyone these days, and it's coming from synergies. I think it's giving us 3, 4 full points of extra growth to be honest. The teams are working together and cross-selling and it's working. Our thesis of $850 million and 41% is on track, all I can tell you right now. We hope to blow it away though, because we will sometime in the next \u2013 I think we've got four years to go against the remarks we made a year ago here in New York and, in four years, I assume we'll have some acquisition. So, hopefully, we'll be ahead of that. But if we don't do anything else, $850 million is our number, is our goal, and I think we're on track. Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yeah. And then, I jumped on a little bit late, but I just wanted to know \u2013 I know you had made some comments about BioPharma in the U.S. So I was curious as to how to think about that going forward, particularly in the upcoming quarter, calendar Q4, and what your expectations are around? If there's going to be any budget flush? Any sign that that business is getting better? Because it feels like there's such a dichotomy between Europe and U.S. for pharma, even if within the same company sometimes. So I was just curious there. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Yeah. I agree with you on that dichotomy for sure. Well, given we're going up against our weakest quarter last year, we probably won't get that confused with any budget flushing. We should do pretty well hopefully. We always hope for a budget flush, especially with our instrument division, PPD. That could happen. On the Biotech division, we seem to have \u2013 it can be up or down, we don't generally have always a strong end-of-calendar-year finish, but last year we didn't and so I'm hoping for a better one this year. And then your comments on pharma, we actually put comments in our transcript about a positive trend in Biopharma. We were probably weaker a year ago due to project timing and we see a modest improvement. I only can say, it's back to where the strength was two years ago. But others have commented on this as well, but we're doing okay. I think our numbers are proving itself as well, so. Hopefully, it continues. Now, if there's further consolidation in pharma in the U.S., it'll be an issue obviously, and there's more rumors flying this morning on the press, right? But so far, so good for us. Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : And we'll go next to Emily Stent with Baird. Emily G. Stent - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. First of all, can you give us an update as to where you are in terms of head count for your commercial ACD and Protein Platform teams? And how close are you to those being fully built out? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Okay. Well, we're nowhere near fully built up, and we're ramping. So we were roughly 80 people or so when we bought that company, and we're now crossing \u2013 it depends on every week we're hiring. I think, as of the quarter-end officially a month ago, I think we were around 150 to 160 in that range. And commercial is roughly 20-ish in Europe and 25-ish in the U.S. But probably consider that we're probably going to add 20%, 30% to that every year. And we're just starting to get on Asia now until we have a smattering of people there, so. It's getting pretty well built and it's a good team, led by experienced people. We'll finish out their milestone end of the calendar year here and we have plans in place with the entire team and we don't actually see any real issues in moving forward with that exact team. So we're pretty hopeful. They're all pretty jazzed, they're pretty excited. I would have to say also in terms of we've done 10 different acquisitions in the time I've been here and this one probably is the most advanced in terms of a team embracing and wanting to be part of Bio-Techne and ready to get at it. Having to have them wait for 18 months while they sought (36:35) a milestone has been challenging actually to be honest. They want to get on with it. They're demanding their T-shirts. Emily G. Stent - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Perfect. Thanks. And then, last one for me. Can you talk about how the Fisher channel business performed in the quarter? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Another question I expected. So it actually did pretty well. But we're in the middle of finalizing negotiations for an extension. So they always do better then, right? So it's just one of those. To be honest, the teams have probably not gotten along as well as they have now in a couple of years. I think I mentioned the last quarter, things were improving with them. We had pretty good numbers and that again happened this quarter. There's always the issue of slop and how does that go up against our core business as they take on more and more of the channel. We're getting better and better at measuring that. But we're also working more and more closely together. The leadership of the divisions are good personal friends. As you know, Jim and I and others, we have worked there at one time. So there's no reason we can't get along. And we're very hopeful. So I think we'll have our extensions signed here soon. And it's good and fair terms for both of us as we grow the business. So, again, I'm not interested in building an army here in the U.S. I mean, I think there's nothing wrong with having this channel partner. They're really paid for growth. They don't take an exorbitant amount. They're very good at what they do. They have great technical people that we train and it's a good value to our business. Should it ever stop being of value, then we'll take it on ourselves. But they do have a commanding force out there, and they really in terms academia which we focused on, they really are in a pretty good spot with the procurement offices of other university states. So, to go against them is also a challenging front. Not that we couldn't do it, but there's no reason to worry about it for now, so. Emily G. Stent - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Great. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Yeah. As you remember, when I started we had zero sales people in the U.S. in this company, and we have now over 20 in the U.S. So we're supplementing, helping them quite a lot. And that's not just for our core business, but it's also because we're getting stronger in bio-production, we're getting stronger in cell culture. We need to have assay specialists out there because our multiplex and our assay strategy in our portfolio is getting larger. And so we're just getting bigger and we have to supplement a lot of areas where they don't have a lot of stuff, so. If we needed to go along without them, we'd probably need 100 people, so. Emily G. Stent - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks so much. Operator : And we'll go next to Matt Hewitt with Craig-Hallum. Matthew G. Hewitt - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC : Good morning, gentlemen. Congratulations on the strong quarter. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Thanks, Matt. Matthew G. Hewitt - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC : A couple of questions. First, I guess, following up on the Fisher negotiations that are ongoing. I know one of the challenges that you've talked about in the past was the extensive training that you guys were needing to go through with their sales people. And then you would see turnover within that group. Is there a way to maybe structure or tie some of the performance metrics to maybe a little less churn within that Fisher group with the new contract? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Well, that's a great memory, Matt. And that was a learning we found 18 months to two years in when we saw our numbers softening and that they had a very high turnover, their technical service people that we depend on. They've since corrected that, really going on two years ago, and we now have a process in place that we do more than once a year to update training, and in webinars and different things, and they're virtually still at full strength. So this is something we watch very carefully. And we do tie things together. So there are commitments where we have to have people working together in the field, et cetera, and co-play days. So we've done all those kinds of things as well. But we rely mostly on the technical people, not on the 600-plus walking army out there that are more order-taking and account-refresh people out there. So we're a very large technical sale (40:50) that's our issue. Matthew G. Hewitt - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC : Okay. And then a follow-up from me. Asia Pacific, Japan, China, obviously a very strong quarter. Any sense whether some of that was maybe a little bit of pent-up demand as funding is starting to improve as the CFDA is starting to get through some of their work? Or is that maybe just the beginning or we should see that continue to accelerate as that market frees up a little bit? Thank you. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: I think, in Japan, it's for sure some pent-up demand, has to be. And in China, we're coming off that comps of this immunoassay area of this Baidu scandal, and that's getting behind us, so. It's one reason the number will start getting better just because the comps are behind us. I don't think there's any pent-up demand. I think it's just continued strong demand in China. I just returned from a very extensive trip there in Hangzhou as well as other big cities, and the demand is amazing, I think just simply amazing, so. Matthew G. Hewitt - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : And we'll go next to Tim Evans with Wells Fargo. Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks. Chuck, can we come back to this dichotomy in pharma between the U.S. and Europe? I'm just curious to kind of get your reflections on what the bigger macro factors might be that's causing that and when they might normalize? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Yeah. I don't know if they're \u2013 I mean they're different companies. I think it comes down to the fact that you've got companies like Bayer and stuff for there that are largely European versus the Mercks and Pfizers over here, et cetera. I think you do see consolidation. Novartis did a lot of consolidating and GSK as well, and they've got sites here. So I don't know how much dichotomy there should be. And we're just not that big to be honest, compared to a lot of the bigger players in our industry. And we're not that large in bio-tech in the U.S., whereas in Europe there's a lot of biotech. There's a lot of mid-size biotech companies in Europe that we play to. And in the U.S., we're not really like that. So I think that's probably the biggest difference. Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks for that. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: More about biotech than big pharma to be honest. That's probably where it is. Operator : And we'll go next to Paul Knight with Janney Montgomery. Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Hi, Chuck. Can you talk to ProteinSimple? Are we going to be more than a 10% to 15% grower there? I mean, what products, is it the reagent, is it West? I mean, what's going on that's making that 24% growth number happen? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Yeah. Well, it's a much more balanced business than the PPD division that was just ProteinSimple, because we have the CyVek platform Simple Plex in there and that's growing 100-plus-percent. And we have the Single-Cell Milo, which we purchased, which is also growing over 100%. But the two major platforms of which we bought ProteinSimple, Simple Western and the Biologics are both growing well north of 20% and accelerating. This is the best quarter we've had in a while, where we've had, as Jim said, seven or eight quarters I think that we're over 20%. I think this quarter coming up was a mid-teens quarter, and that's the lowest quarter we've had in over two years with these guys. Three years ago, we had to fix some things there, as you remember, but I think it's mission accomplished. So, as I mentioned earlier, Paul, I don't expect anything less than 20% moving forward. But 15% is on record, 15% should be safe. But things look pretty good, should be 20-ish. If it isn't 20%, we'll be looking to ask why and doing what we do to try to manage for better execution. So the team is solid. We haven't had any turnover in probably three years now at least. Got strong leaders, they're in great shape. The executives there are firmly on the team here for overall Bio-Techne and we have three divisions and the leader is as much a leader of the company as he is that division and the strong team behind it. And as you know, we have other great operational leaders that come from our network that have worked with us in the past in places like Thermo and 3M and other places, and it's all going pretty well. Commercially, I'm very happy. We didn't talk about that much, but the Biotech division was working very closely with PPD on the commercial front. So we have a lot of cross-selling going on. And as I mentioned earlier, we have 20 reps in Biotech and they are definitely helping support the PPD reps out there. And they're selling solutions, not just pieces of iron and vials, so. Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : And then, the pacing of academia, was it picking up as the quarter wrapped up? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: I wouldn't say that. I'd say, as a trend for the year, it's been better. So it's improving, but there isn't any inflection I wouldn't say. Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Okay. Thank you. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: I mean, and to follow on that, a lot of it's \u2013 I think we talked last quarter about we're starting to see NIH funding, and I think that's part of it. It's continued and we're not the only ones talking this quarter, everyone is talking about improved NIH funding and affecting numbers. And we see it and it's showing up in our numbers as well obviously, so. Operator : And there are no other questions at this time. I'd like to turn things back to our speakers for closing remarks. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: All right. Well, a great quarter, and we hope it's the first of the four this year. So, thanks for the call today. We'll talk to you next quarter. Bye. Operator : Thank you, everyone. That does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.",

I'll now turn the call over to Chuck. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter conference call. As you saw in our press release, in Q2, we continue to build on our momentum from Q1 of our fiscal year. The company delivered 14% organic growth in the quarter and our two divisions that primarily serve the life science research market, Biotechnology and Protein Platforms, collectively grew 18% organically. These are the best results since we started to transform the company nearly five years ago. Importantly, the growth that we saw in Q2 continued to be broad-based in both geography and product category. Investments made in the core company and the synergies with our strategic acquisitions are beginning to display nice leverage and upside. Europe continued to deliver outstanding results with Q2 organic growth at nearly 20%. Europe growth was also broad-based with solid contribution from both our reagent and instrument product categories. All major countries in Europe experienced growth in both the academic and BioPharma end markets contributing equally. We have been talking about the strength of our subsidiary business model in Europe for many quarters now and for as many quarters, we have seen strong results. The synergies of cross-selling and commercial collaboration have been most apparent here, but we are seeing this model build momentum in our other key regions as well. As in Europe, our Asia region also broadly delivered outstanding results. In China, growth of our Western brands grew 30% in Q2, just as they had in the two preceding quarters. We were also pleased to see our local China for China protein brand, PrimeGene, returned to growth of over 20% in the quarter, with immunotherapy government crackdown otherwise known as the Baidu scandal, now well behind us and annualized in the numbers. Japan continues to see a turnaround from what had been a multi-year decline, growing over 10% in Q2, while the rest of APAC grew over 15%. Here in the U.S., the year-over-year growth accelerated in the second quarter, with over a 15% increase in revenue. Some of this growth was helped by an uncharacteristic (03:31) weak December quarter last year when our industry didn't see the normal calendar year end budget flush from our BioPharma customers. But with less political uncertainty facing our customers this year, we saw a return to typical year-end buying patterns and experienced nearly20% growth in BioPharma as a result. Less political uncertainty and recent funding increases to NIH also drove strong growth from our academia customers in Q2, with 11% growth in academia. This is the highest we have seen from this end market many years. While we are not expecting the same level of growth in our U.S. end markets that we saw in Q2 to continue going forward, the underlying market trends in both our BioPharma and academic end market remained strong. Now, for some color on our Q2 performance by division. Our Biotech division grew 14% organically in Q2 with the core reagent product categories collectively growing around 10%, and ACD growing at another quarter north of 40%. Within Biotech's core products, our protein reagent business had a phenomenal quarter, growing over 15%. One of our key strategies has been to focus our scientific talent on developing the most complex proteins that our customers, especially BioPharma, need to support their ever expanding research needs. Often these proteins are not available from any other source. The metric for our scientists has not been just how many proteins we develop, but more importantly the quality and unmet need in these proteins. The results that we've had in our protein business, so far in fiscal 2018 would indicate that this strategy is taking hold. But it wasn't just proteins within Biotech that performed well in Q2, our antibody, assay, and small molecule product categories all experienced mid-to-high single digit growth in the quarter. Standouts included our multiplex assay kits which grew over 30%, while our Novus branded antibodies continued its long streak of double-digit growth. An example of the investments we have made to drive the sustained growth we found with our updated Flow Cytometry Panel Builder tool which is found on our website and supports the use of Bio-Techne's vast selection of over 18,000 conjugated antibodies across targets and colors. The updated tool has better performance and offers new features that more efficiently streamlines the process of designing multi-color flow cytometry panels with Bio-Techne. By automating the selection of cellular markers and fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies, researchers can reliably choose reagents for multi-channel cytometry experiments, avoiding errors from improper selection of reagents with significant spectral overlap. Increased product visibility is also a clear advantage to Bio-Techne, as the Flow Cytometry Panel Builder offers researchers a clear view and experimental design to efficiently and successfully utilize R&D Systems and Novus Biologics reagents. And finally there is ACD, which continued its streak of rapid market adoption in Q2 and hit a number of milestones during the quarter. First and foremost, the business beat its $45 million calendar year 2017 revenue target, which was established at the time by Bio-Techne acquired ACD 18 months ago when the business had a trailing 12 months revenues of approximate $25 million. Consistent with this rapid rise in revenue, ACD is also celebrating a milestone in the adoption of its RNAscope in situ hybridization ISH technology, reaching 1,000 publications and increasing to an average of more than one publication per day. Papers using RNAscope now feature regularly in top-tier journals. This is clear evidence that scientists are applying RNAscope ISH as a robust and sensitive assay that yields the high-quality data necessary for cutting-edge studies. The surge, 400 publications featuring RNAscope in 2017 alone includes a notable increase in pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. Authors of recent publications include researchers at Bayer, Merck, and Eli Lily. The increase in these industries highlights awareness of the robustness, sensitivity, specificity, and high success rate of the RNAscope assay. Reflecting confidence in the assay, ACD's ISH technology is also becoming a primary assay used in research, rather than just a secondary confirmatory assay. In addition to the growing number of industrial publications in immuno-oncology, cancer, gene therapy, and many orphan diseases development programs, RNAscope is also being used in new areas of academic research. These fields include neuroscience, metabolic diseases, and virology and infectious disease research, which have recently seen fast growth alongside RNAscope's established presence in oncology and stem cell research. We see a long runway of revenue growth ahead of ACD as pathologists continues to appreciate and value its RNA ISH transformative technology. The clinical diagnostic markets for ACD's products are just beginning to be tapped and we barely started and tracking it. We believe the best is still yet ahead for ACD, especially once full integration with the rest of the company is complete by the end of the fiscal year. In addition to driving organic growth for the company, we continue to bolster our Biotech reagent portfolio with acquisitions that supplement and leverage our legacy products. Last quarter, we discussed the September acquisition of Trevigen, whose products enable researchers to better understand cell behavior and genotoxic events on cells complementing our current reagent offering. This past month, we announced the January 1 acquisition of Atlanta Biologicals, whose product focus on supplying cell culture sera, media and reagents for life science research market. Many of our products are used in tissue culture applications in the Atlanta Biologicals fetal bovine serum or FBS, product line strengthens and complements our current tissue culture reagents offering and furthers our efforts to provide more complete solutions to our research customers. With the increasing interest in 3D cell cultures and other cell based clinical applications, we believe there is value in providing customers alternative and reliable sources of high quality FBS and other tissue culture reagents. Having better tools to study cell behavior in physiologically relevant environments and high quality reagents increases researchers' confidence in the experimental findings. The recent acquisitions of both Atlanta Biologics (sic) [Atlanta Biologicals] and Trevigen expands our franchise into cell culture and together will serve our customers better while leveraging Bio-Techne's sales channels. Speaking of leveraging our sales channels, the results we discussed earlier by our cohesive sales teams in Europe and Asia continue to really shine through in our Protein Platforms division this past quarter. This division, with 33% organic growth in Q2, reported the highest quarterly organic growth since we acquired ProteinSimple over three years ago. And that is on top of reference of a revenue base that is double what it was back then. Q2 of fiscal 2018 now marks the eighth quarter in a row of double-digit organic growth. Seven out of eight of those with growth over 20% or better. All division's major product categories, Biologics, Simple Western, Simple Plex, and Single-Cell Western grew more than 20% in the second quarter, with Simple Western growing well over 30%, and Simple Plex growing nearly 200%. The growth was well distributed between instrument sales, consumable sales, and service, demonstrating the increasing acceptance of these instruments as useful tools for protein analytics and the future potential growth from consumables to be used on the high number of instruments that are being placed today. In fact the primary Simple Western instrument, recently hit an important milestone of 1,000 placements in the field. As we have said many times before, the market's Protein Platforms solutions are collectively approaching $2 billion, and we still have less than 5% share, thus there is plenty of runway for continued double-digit growth well into the future. Another important milestone achieved by Protein Platforms this past quarter was delivering over 20% operating margin to the bottom line. To grow from being unprofitable to over 20% profit in less than four years is a tremendous achievement. It demonstrates a scrupulous detail to prioritizing investments for growth while driving and delivering operational productivity. I'm very proud of what this team has accomplished, and they're not even close to being done yet. Next, our Diagnostics division bucked the trend of our life sciences businesses and had a tough quarter with a 4% decline in revenue. While end-user demand still seems to be solid, as demonstrated by our short-shelf-life hematology controls products, which experienced high-single-digit growth, consolidation and reimbursement pricing pressure in the industry continues to motivate our large OEM customers to defer purchases whenever they can. When they do place orders, they have been prioritizing lower-cost products plus lower margin to us. The combination of low overall volume and lower margin product mix caused a bit of a perfect storm impact in Diagnostics margins this past quarter. However, we do see rays of light through the current storm clouds with orders returning in the second half of fiscal 2018. This is to be expected as our OEM customers cannot defer the control of reagents and kits they need to serve their customers indefinitely. The indication we received from our largest Diagnostic customers would suggest that our growth in this division will return to mid-single digit levels in the second half of fiscal year with operating margins close to what we expect from this business, plus 30%. We believe the worst is behind us in the Diagnostics division. The end markets are pretty relatively healthy, our business with our Chinese OEM customer is especially strong, and the project pipeline with our OEM partners is loaded to support growth for years to come. Finally, I would like to comment on our adjusted EPS performance in Q2. With our operating margin met our expectations for the quarter, we saw a large additional benefit to EPS as a result of tax reform that was passed just before the New Year. Jim will provide the details. With lower U.S. corporate tax rates in the calendar 2018 brings down the company's blended effective tax rate for the fiscal year. Thus we saw a benefit to our tax expense right away in our December ended quarter. With lower taxes expected going forward, we will continue to invest both internally in commercial expansion and product innovation as well as externally in opportunistic M&A just as we have over the past four years. However, we want our employees to realize some immediate benefit from the lower taxes and therefore paid out $1 million worth of bonuses to all non-executive employees in early January. This cost is accrued for and recorded in December when the announcement to our employees was made thus it's included in our operating results in Q2. We support the lower corporate tax rates and believe that it will allow both our shareholders and employees to benefit from even more investment in the future. We were also glad to use some of these tax savings immediately to express our gratitude for the fine job our employees have done executing our strategy not just in Q2, but also in all the previous quarters since we started this new journey nearly five years ago. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim, who will provide more details on our financial performance for the quarter. Jim? James T. Hippel - Bio-Techne Corp.: Thanks, Chuck. I'll provide an overview for our Q2 financial performance for the total company, and then provide some color on each of our three segments. Starting with the overall second quarter financial performance, adjusted EPS increased 26% to $1.02, while GAAP EPS for the quarter was $1.29 compared to $0.20 in the prior year. The increase in GAAP EPS includes a one-time benefit of $0.94 from recently passed tax reform. Most of this one-time benefit was due to the revaluation of our deferred tax liabilities using lower future tax rates. Q2 reported revenue was $154.2 million, an increase of 17% year-over-year, with organic revenue increasing 14%. Fourth quarter reported sales include a 1% growth contribution from acquisitions and a 2% contribution from favorable foreign exchange translation. By geography, the U.S. grew in the mid-teens with BioPharma growth in the high-teens and academia growth in the low-teens. Europe's organic growth was near 20%, with BioPharma sales growth in the high-teens and academia over 20%. In Asia, China's organic growth was nearly 30% in the second quarter. Japan grew in the low-teens and the rest of the Asia-Pac region grew in the mid-teens. Note that all references made to growth rates by region and end market exclude our OEM sales, which mostly occurred in our Diagnostics segment and, to a lesser extent, our Biotech segment. Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin was 70.2% in Q2, down approximately 80 basis points from the prior year due to product mix within our Diagnostics and Biotech division. Foreign exchange helped adjusted gross margins by approximately 50 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted SG&A in Q2 was 26.2% of revenue, 60 basis points higher than last year, but down 120 basis points sequentially from last quarter. The SG&A increase was driven by the $1 million bonus paid to employees, following the passage of tax reform and to a lesser extent the acquisition of Trevigen and strategic investments made in our core businesses to support growth. R&D expense in Q2 was 9% of revenue, down 110 basis points from the prior year due to volume leverage. The year-over-year increase of R&D spend in Q2 was approximately 5%. The resulting adjusted operating margin for Q2 was 35%, a decrease of 30 basis points from the prior-year period. Looking at our numbers below operating income, net interest expense in Q2 was $2.2 million compared to $1.8 million of net interest expense last year. The higher interest expense is due to multiple rate increases in the past year on our outstanding line-of-credit. Other non-operating expense for the quarter was $0.2 million compared to $0.9 million in the prior-year quarter. The higher expense last year was associated with transactional FX expense, which did not reoccur in the current quarter. Our adjusted effective tax rate in Q2 was 24.7%, nearly a 6 percentage point improvement from the prior year due to tax reform. For the back half of fiscal year 2018, we expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be around 25%, plus or minus 100 basis points. In terms of returning capital, we continue to pay our dividend and paid out $12 million in the quarter. Average diluted shares were up approximately 1% over the year-ago period at 37.9 million shares outstanding. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, $38.8 million of cash was generated from operations in the second quarter and our investment in capital expenditures was $6.3 million. On our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $162.4 million of cash and short-term available-for-sale investments. Our long-term debt obligations at the end of Q2 stood at $362.5 million, up $19 million from the end of Q4, as we drew down on our line-of-credit facility prepared for the January 1 closing of the Atlanta Biologicals acquisition. Going forward, our capital deployment priorities remain opportunistic M&A, our dividend, and debt pay-down. Now, I'll discuss the performance of our three business segments starting with the Biotechnology segment. Q2 reported sales were $101.4 million with reported revenue increasing 18%. Acquisitions contributed 1% to revenue growth. Foreign exchange contributed 3%, and organic growth was 14% led by our ACD and protein reagent product line. Operating income for the Biotech segment was 17% higher in Q2 compared to the prior year, and adjusted operating margin was 45.6%, a decrease of 40 basis points year-over-year. The decrease from prior year was driven by the timing of unfavorable product mix, which we expect will improve in the second half of fiscal year 2018. Turning to the Protein Platforms segment. Net sales in Q2 were $29.4 million, an organic increase of 33% from the prior-year period with currency translation having a favorable impact of 3%. Growth for the division was broad based in all major product lines and regions. Operating income in Q2 for the Protein Platforms segment was over 3 times higher than last year, representing an adjusted operating margin of 20.8%, an increase of over 1,200 basis points from the prior year. Strong volume leverage and operational productivity drove the year-over-year improvement, partially offset by strategic growth investments. Moving on to our Diagnostics segment. Reported revenue in Q2 was $23.4 million, which reported an organic growth decreasing 4% from the prior year. Our short-cycle OEM hematology controls business experienced high-single-digit growth indicating that the end markets are still strong. However, as Chuck explained earlier, many of our large OEM customers have sharpened their focus on net working capital management and continue to push out to the long-cycle orders to the fullest extent possible. When they have placed orders, it has been for lower-cost products, which significantly impacted the division's operating margin in Q2. At 16.1%, Diagnostic division's operating margin this quarter was down 770 basis points from the prior year. The visibility we have for the second half of fiscal year 2018 currently reflects a release of long-cycle orders from our larger OEM customers that would allow the division to report more in line with historical norms of mid-single-digit growth and operating margins approaching 30%. In summary for the quarter, our breadth of growth was large, both in terms of end markets and product lines. Our operational profitability was in line with our expectations despite the challenges faced with product mix. We continue to prudently invest back into the business, especially to fuel the growth of our game-changing ACD and Protein Platforms product line. Protein Platforms' record operating margin shows how investing for growth combined with operational excellence can accelerate the bottom line. This gives us even greater confidence in the ability for this division, along with the fast-growing ACD, to achieve 30% operating margins within the next five years. On the bottom line, tax reform was a real positive for Bio-Techne, and it will bolster our future cash flows and enhance our strategy of investing for growth, both internally and externally as the opportunity arises. Our view for the remainder of the year remains upbeat, although we will face tougher comps in the second half of fiscal year 2018. Thus, we expect overall company organic growth rate to remain healthy in the high-single-digit range. With regard to profitability for remainder of fiscal year 2018, our view hasn't changed in the past couple of quarters. Total company adjusted operating margin should sequentially rise throughout the remainder of the year and be on par with last year's margin over the same time horizon. That concludes my prepared comments. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Margaret to open the line for some questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now take our first question from Catherine Schulte from Baird. Please go ahead. Catherine Ramsey Schulte - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hey, guys. Congrats on the nice quarter and thanks for the questions. First one from me would just be on Protein Platforms, some nice acceleration there. What's the main driver of that acceleration? Is it adoption by academics, by pharma, just maturation of the sales force, what would you say is the most important driver? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Well, one nice thing about this quarter was, we had 33% growth, it was really good everywhere. So, we had accelerated growth really in all our major platforms. The Starwood has become Simple Plex and that I would just say it's writing into the curve of acceptance and with really all the major pharmas now having it, and it's four years into the \u2013 with Roche as an example. So, 200% growth, and it's certainly not a small base anymore. So, I think it's running roughly 20 or so machines per quarter. And remember, this thing really choose the consumables, right, it's a closed system so it's a 60%, 70%, 80% type of attach rate for consumables revenue. Biologics was probably still the biggest overall contributor, kind of remaining where it's been, and then Simple Western had a wonderful quarter, better than usual. We've talked about Simple Western being strong double-digits, but it was \u2013 this quarter was one with over 20%. So, really picking up some steam, which was nice to see. We had a lot of big box orders this quarter too which helped some of that, but it's also nice to see a lot of big box orders. And that's still a strong platform. So, all-in-all, very distributed. I would say, still more on the BioPharma side, strength-wise in academia side but strong growth in academia and really in all fronts, some NIH in the U.S. but also Europe was strong as well. So I mean we've been promising 15% or better and going forward and we've had 20% or so over the last quite a few quarters. To get over 30% when this is over $100 million run rate business, from our point of view, it's just phenomenal so. Catherine Ramsey Schulte - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: All right. Great. Thank you. And then what are your U.S. academic and government customers saying just on the budget outlook for this year? It seems like the numbers have been pretty good, but is there any hesitancy based on uncertainty or is it business as usual? And then related to that, how much of your business would be impacted by a potential government shutdown and curious what you've seen in prior cases of that? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Well, at the macro level, we've been talking about a drift more towards BioPharma from academia by the numbers for quite some time. The U.S. NIH portion of the company's revenue is less than 15%. In the U.S. portion now, we've actually drifted down to 35% to 65% academia versus BioPharma. So that's a big shift from few years ago. NIH is strong still. We've not heard any real warning signs or any real drift from that type of thinking, but it's not the end of February. We know things have got to flush out, and there'll be new discussion. We'll see after this week in the market, but right now, it's going to be pretty (24:58) probably. But no warning signs yet. I foresee kind of stable academic funding for the foreseeable future anyway. I don't think it's going to be double digit. But these nice add-ons of 5% to 8% or so that Congress has been doing, and I hope continues so. Catherine Ramsey Schulte - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : And we can now take our next question from Puneet Souda from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Puneet Souda - Leerink Partners LLC : Yeah. Hi Chuck. Outstanding quarter. Thanks for taking the question here. So what's your sense on the growth in BioPharma and academic and the sustainability here in the fiscal quarter? Maybe if you can describe how much of this was a budget-flush phenomena and how much of it this is \u2013 are there any fundamental changes in the market and in preclinical discovery that's driving the growth that you're seeing in Simple Plex and across BTD and assays, as well in the proteins, if you could elaborate on that first? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: I think first you got to separate the markets and the trends and that macro level to (26:10) product platforms that we have that are just inflecting. There're just astounding acceptance of these, and they're just in the right place the right time, and they're going to grab more of the share out there because they're hot. They're what the customers want. It's what they've asked for. This is why you bought ProteinSimple. They were a way ahead of the game five, six years ago. ACD, the same story, and they hit a real need, and that need is developing itself into real market acceptance and taking share. So, layered on top of that, I think, is just a strong market. And I think our BioPharma, I'd say awareness is just increasing. People know who Bio-Techne now is after four years. We have a much stronger commercial presence. We have a much stronger commercial presence at tradeshows, publications. It's regional not just U.S., and we're just, I think, getting to a, call it, a bit of a critical mass factor that it's affecting the size of this company where it's starting to really get some extra traction and you can see our liquidity is still small. Still long way to go, but in terms of the products and the markets we serve which are vast, right, we are definitely a complicated little company still in my opinion with many, many markets to serve. And so, there's a lot of runway in all of them, to be honest. I would say to your last part primarily, we still serve oncology research more than anything else... James T. Hippel - Bio-Techne Corp.: Immunology. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: In immunology, some neuroscience, those are the big hitters for us and those are all strong areas right now. Puneet Souda - Leerink Partners LLC : Great. That's helpful. And then ACD, obviously, another strong quarter. You pointed out to $45 million for the year maybe. Could you give us the contribution in the quarter and maybe just in sense of the IHC market, a portion of that is in BioPharma, how penetrated are you there at the moment and sort of what's the expectation as we go towards Diagnostic longer term? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Well, the Diagnostic component is still under a couple of million. So, it's just getting started. We're depending on partners for that. We don't have the army we need for a regulated type of marketplace, not yet anyway. And the traditional IHC area, the pathology that we're addressing with ACD is an early innings. And this is $1.5 billion kind of marketplace. So, you talk about everything we serve there. So, we've talked about the growth continuing at north of 35%. Here we go another quarter well north of 40%. And it's not so small anymore, it's a $50 million run rate business going forward here, and we expect it to continue growing very strong for quite some time, and share, we're still well under 10% (29:05). And I think what speaks to the credibility and why there is still so much possibility is look at the publication count, and it's more than one a day now over a thousand. Everybody is using this stuff and they simply want to show off how great it is. And it's just getting more and more awareness and there's a long way to go. We had very strong results as you saw in the numbers. Again, we really couldn't hire enough. We can't assimilate enough investment to actually warrant even more growth. So we're kind of at the limit you can handle. And that's why you see profitability actually increasing ahead of schedule, and yet we're still are over 40% growth. So, we think it will \u2013 we're not going to promise 40%. We've been promising 30% or 35% or better, I think, for next year, so it should be in that range, at least. Drops under 30%, something's wrong, shouldn't be that. So, that's our point of view. We see this as a $200 million plus business in three years out or so. Puneet Souda - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. That's very helpful. And just last one, Atlanta Biologicals, do you plan to extend that into Bio Production longer term from the research tissue culture or would this be a research cell culture application mostly? Thank you. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Short term, Phase 1 and Phase 3 search application, the synergy of short term are taking this thing outside the U.S. So, we have great channels we can sell with our current channels. It was really a small, insulated company, family-owned from different continent even, so not a lot of oversight. So, we think we really can do a lot with this. We're already seeing with Trevigen the same story unfolds there, and we can take this portfolio within our current reagents portfolio on the road and get into Asia and Europe and other places. So, as we go further with that and build more critical mass, it's not a very large business, I think your point is well taken, and we'll be going much more towards those other areas as well. So, there's a lot of, as you know, all the media manufacturers and we sell everywhere \u2013 they're customers, we sell our (31:10) a lot of spots. And so, we have the ability actually to offer a very differentiated product line, if you give us a few years here. Puneet Souda - Leerink Partners LLC : Thanks. Appreciate all the details. Thank you. Operator : We can now take our next question from Dan Arias from Citi. Please go ahead. Bryan A. Kipp - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi, guys. This is actually Bryan Kipp on behalf of Dan. Just want to take a step back. Chuck, I noted your comment on the Simple Western side seeing big-box orders in the quarter. How many of those box orders were new, too, or are they legacy customers? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: That's a good question. I would guess, I don't have it in front of me, it was a double-digit kind of quarter, which is very rare now for us and something that I won't really repeat regularly by the way, it's just kind of timing for us, for big box. And I would say half and half. I would say about half the customers probably already had one are expanding and probably the other ones were new. There were a lot of new accounts actually and when you need throughput, you want to go to big box. I'll step out here and talk about one key customer is Roche. They have been, obviously, a big facility in Basel and they centralized core lab all their Westerns. And it used to take a week of a team to do the Western for the site, and they do it really with a single person doing it overnight on big boxes now. And they've been expanding because \u2013 and they'll never go back and they have become a nice advocate for the technology and probably a super user for us. They know how to use this technology really better than anybody. And so, it's just more of that I think and you'll see more of that. Bryan A. Kipp - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Can I ask you a quick follow-up on that? I just saw recently a lot of new commentary or new studies out there on cell line development and it was interesting as you kind of piece through the instruments used. There was lot more references to this Simple Western platform and using automated Western blot. Is that a trend that you guys are seeing, and is a lot of that the new customer demand, or is that supported by your legacy guys? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: We're hearing more and more of that. I think that's part of the strategy going forward. It's such a big diverse pond doing Western. The way people do them vary across \u2013 it's very diverse in academia especially. So, I think attacking Biotech and cell culture and to new uses is really a nice area for us. And clearly, it makes sense because when you have an automated platform that has reproducible results, if you take the human error out of the whole process it's where people need to go. If you want to do really good science and you want to do BioPharma related science, and you really got to have process and paper trails to everything you do. You really want to have a tool like this that automates (34:03). We've always thought that and quite frankly it's grown even slower than we thought because quite frankly (34:09) different. It's just not as easy fall off the table process as you think. Reproducibility is key and you don't get reproducibility when you do them by hand and sooner or later the world's going to figure that out, so. Bryan A. Kipp - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Helpful and just Simple Plex. I think it's an interesting platform that's obviously seeing increased momentum. Just taking a step back, I think, when you first acquired that asset there was a long-term contingent consideration if you guys achieved a $100 million revenue milestone. Now, obviously you probably don't want to put a flag in the ground around that for 2020, but just getting a sense of how the deal model is playing out relative to expectations would be helpful, one. And two, the new announcement that you guys just had with BioAgilytix. How do you expect that addition to support incremental growth going forward? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Well first, I'll address the one. One is, yeah, there was a deal closing final milestone in the arrangement and that was the $100 million of revenue in 2020. Of course we had to wait about three years for dollar revenue one. So, I've put that behind the curve. So even right now at our current rate, if we continue at a 200% growth per quarter for the next two years, we would not hit that $100 million, but we would be a lot bigger. It'd be really nice to see. Hard to see us growing that much that fast, that long. But I don't see this platform as a $200 million platform like ACD and Protein Platforms, but it has the legs to get to $100 million as a platform, but I think it would take beyond 2020. And it will remain very strong growth because there's a lot of acceptance and there's a lot of place with the uses (35:52). And your second question, maybe I'll \u2013 Frank (sic) [Bryan], I'm not really up on that. Bryan A. Kipp - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Sorry. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Yeah, I don't have the press release, the recent press release; it was an application we put out. We'll get back to you on that. Bryan A. Kipp - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Helpful. Thanks, guys. Operator : Next question from (36:18) from William Blair. Please go ahead. Unknown Speaker : Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my questions. Just want to follow-up on the organic growth outlook for the second half of the fiscal year. So, regarding the previously issued guidance of organic revenue growth for 8% for fiscal 2018, does this rate still seem consistent with what you would expect to see in the second half? I know that you mentioned that you have some tough comps coming out, but it seems like you feel Biotechnology and Protein Platforms segments will continue to accelerate, and that there will be an increase in OEM orders in the second half. Can you maybe just describe what you're looking at here? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Well, (36:53) said, we're pretty much ready for this question, expected it from me. We're still on track as an 8% to 12% grower. There's going to be timing. Our second half is definitely tougher than last year. This was an easier comp this quarter but even if you add the two together, it was a very strong quarter for us. Consistent 12%-plus quarters going forward, probably not, but 8% to 12%, in that range is what we're kind of standing behind. As you said, there should be winds in our sail for Diagnostics the second half, and so that will help. In fact, if Diagnostics would even hit plan, have been just on target, this core, which is really low single-digit growth, we'd have had two extra points of organic growth, we would have been 16%, even. So, you have that to layer in. So, we'd like to be able to come out and say we're a consistent 10% grower. I'm not quite sure we're quite there yet. We need a little more credibility. But giving you guys a range of 8% to 12%, I think, is appropriate and we feel very good about that range of 8% to 12% right now for the next two quarters. Unknown Speaker : Great. Yeah. That's extremely helpful. Thank you for that. And then just following up on bit of an unrelated notes, just want to touch based on your M&A pipeline. Have you seen that be affected from the recent tax legislation? Now, the larger part is becoming more aggressive, given some of them obviously have just come into a lot more capital. Are you seeing some increased competition in regards to your M&A pipeline? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Well, it's probably too early. I think there's been a lot of commentary in the market this week, and most people don't think tax is really baked in anything yet, people \u2013 companies are trying to figure out where they fit. We're a fiscal year, so we kind of had to figure it out because we get a blended improvement already this past quarter. A lot of companies are finishing up a calendar year they're just still kind of getting to it now, really. So, I do think you're right though. I think \u2013 I predict that it will lay out more available cash, and people put to work, and the M&A will be, I think, a top priority with that. Plus, we got all those cash coming back into the country and it's going put to work. So, I don't think it will be less, I think there will be more M&A. I think there will be more competition and I don't see prices going down. But again, this is life sciences and Biotech, right. There's lots of innovation, there's lots of new companies all the time, there's lots of new areas forming in every couple of years, and there's going to be a lot of interest in new things And I think that's what drives our industry, and it drives what I think other industries would call high prices in life sciences. But look what you can get from it. I mean the things we do change the world in virtually overnight so. Unknown Speaker : Got it. Great. Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Dan Leonard from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Mike Sarcone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, guys. This is Mike Sarcone on for Dan Leonard. So, my first question, you had posted really nice organic growth for the quarter. I was a little surprised that the margin leverage wasn't what I would have expected. Can you just comment on the margin and how that played out? Was it all the Diagnostics sales decline? Or \u2013 can you just walk me through that? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Yeah. I want to give you a sound bite. I'm going to let Jim take some detail. So we are also ready for this question as well. One, we gave $1 million to the employee base, and otherwise we probably would have been over kind of what people expected, a rein-in (40:25) range. After that, we made a comment about mix. And we had mix. It was definitely OEM-related mix. And of course, the one business where we do see scalable leverage is \u2013 because it's real manufacturing and volume matters and that is the Diagnostics area. So, as we talked about, we were the lighter (40:45) this quarter. So without that extra volume, we see a margin hit on that negative leverage. So, Jim might want to comment for it. James T. Hippel - Bio-Techne Corp.: No. I think Chuck's exactly right. Between the $1 million bonus we gave our employees and the deleveraging and bad product mix we had in our Diagnostics business, those two things alone cost us easily 1.5 of margin. So I think we would have had just definitely better margin without those two occurrences. But I think the bonus was the right thing to do and it won't \u2013 obviously that won't be in the results going forward. And we do expect the Diagnostics mix to improve. So... Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: A final comment I'd make too would be \u2013 and I noticed this in a lot of results reported. There were a lot of \u2013 lots of commenting on mix, especially with respect to Europe. And I think when you have strong results in Europe and of the overhead of duty, tax, freight, and everything else that also can siphon a little bit of margin from you. So, we've had exceptional results in Europe, 20% growth. So, you get that \u2013 you get a bit of a little bit of mix hit off of that too because the overhead of selling in the \u2013 Europe compared to the U.S. So, we'll take the gross sell (41:53). The growth is worth having, this extra little hit mix, so... Mike Sarcone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Thanks. And my follow-up is on just the Diagnostics industry health in general. I know you said you've seen good trends fundamentally. Have you heard any customers talk about pulling back due to Medicare test reimbursement cuts under PAMA? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: No. We get asked about this PAMA a lot. We don't see it affecting us a whole lot and we're just not anything big enough in the food chain as there is \u2013 really the issue. But no, doesn't affect our business. We don't hear a lot about it either. We don't hear a lot of grumbling about it either to be honest. So, I'm not sure I \u2013 and maybe overhyped in general, but... Mike Sarcone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Robert Amparo from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Robert Amparo - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. Hey, guys. You covered a lot already, but just going back to ACD, can you quantify how much the investments in commercial and infrastructure were dilutive to the Biotech segment's operating margin? And do you see that continuing for the rest of the year as you aim for that 50%? Also, how are you guys feeling about the retention of key ACD employees at this point? Thanks. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Well, we're not going to give an awful lot of color about the details within the division but \u2013 and Jim can follow-up on that in a minute here. But I will talk about retention, as this has been probably the best acquisition I've ever done in terms of retention. So, we feel really good right now about the team of leadership going forward, the engagement. Just the morale of really wanting to be a part of Bio-Techne and almost asking ahead of time for this and that when they \u2013 typically, you see some resistance doing an integration. We see anything but, this acquisition. The culture there has been phenomenal. The leader, the founder that created this company was really a great guy and really, really was careful in his hiring and they're just \u2013 they're just all rock stars. Love them. James T. Hippel - Bio-Techne Corp.: Well, I would say, ACD from a margin perspective is that there \u2013 as we mentioned last quarter where they broke into double-digit operating margin for the first time, they continued that streak in Q2 and continue to sequentially increase our margins as well. So, we're still in the low- to mid-teens on the operating margin line. But again, with that very high growth of 40%-plus that caused that pretty \u2013 a pretty diverse mix impact within the division of Biotech. Robert Amparo - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. James T. Hippel - Bio-Techne Corp.: Or even half of the mix then, but they \u2013 we just \u2013 as I mentioned before, we were hiring, training as best we can, but it's a technical platform and so it takes special people. And this is a global issue now, with the growth targets everywhere, and it's not that small anymore. So, it takes a lot of investment. We're trying to feed it that \u2013 as long as we can feed it and stay north of 30%, 35%, we're pretty happy. Staying north of 40%, we're really, really happy. So... Operator : Next question comes from Matthew Hewitt from Craig-Hallum Capital Group. Please go ahead. Matthew G. Hewitt - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC : Good morning, gentlemen. Congratulations on that 10% threshold or double-digit threshold on the revenue growth. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Yeah. Thanks, Matt. Matthew G. Hewitt - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC : Just a couple questions from me. First, very strong operating margin improvement in the Protein Platforms segment. What can that segment get to? Obviously, acquisitions can impact it, but when you think about that segment growing over the next few years, where do you see the margins extending to? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: I'll tell you a funny story. So, we \u2013 as you know, we have a pretty rigorous process here for prioritizing our business and then that rolls into our plan \u2013 our strategic plan. And as part of our strategic plan, we obviously do a five-year outlook. And every business has to \u2013 has to foreshadow and build models of what this five-year outlook can look like. And this team was pushing back a little bit on reaching it. The goal that we had for this business when we bought them was 30%. And the achievability of a 30% op margin business in instruments is only so because of the high IP content. This is a high-60s percent growth margin business model. So, unless you're really overdoing it commercially in SG&A, there should be a way to get to 30%. A little bit of pushback. Well, then these guys come back, come in this quarter and pound ahead and give us 21% already. And they're only in a 100 \u2013 less than half of where they're going to be, probably a third of where they're going to be five years from now. So there's no doubt in my mind, we're going to get this business to 30% in our op margins. And that is of course, based on continued strength through the IP, and so the pricing of course stays and it stays sound. And we have a very fundamental IP. We feel very good about these solutions. And the traction is there, and it's accelerating due to the things I mentioned earlier. So, I'd say, wait and see. Now, are we pushing it for 25% next quarter? No. They are a good five points ahead of plan right now. They have a little bit of same issue we have with ACD : we do have to keep funding it and keep investing. And we're very focused on investing. The head count in this division will be \u2013 by the end of this fiscal year, maybe calendar, would be nearly double what it was when we purchased the company. So there's been a lot of investments and that will continue. It will be hundreds of millions of dollars someday. Matthew G. Hewitt - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC : Fantastic. All right. And then, Jim, maybe one question for you. Congratulations on another step-down in the DSOs this quarter. Is the target to kind of get back to the 2014-2015 levels of around 50%, or given the size and the growth that the company has experienced the last couple of years, is this kind of the normalized run rate? Thank you. James T. Hippel - Bio-Techne Corp.: Yeah. Thanks for noticing that. We've actually put a lot of effort over the past year in focusing particularly on the receivables side of net working capital and bringing those balances down and getting our DSOs down. So \u2013 and you're right, we've seen some very nice improvement there over the past year. I think we're at a point now where we probably were a couple years ago. And I think the rate of improvement will probably decrease, but I can tell you, internally we're laser-focused on collections and making sure our terms stay within commercial \u2013 reasonable term lengths of time. So, I would \u2013 I'd model flat to slightly down, but not the kind of improvement you saw the past year. Matthew G. Hewitt - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC : Okay, great. Thank you. James T. Hippel - Bio-Techne Corp.: There will be big improvements in the coming couple of years I think on how we manage our inventory and how we'll be able to process. This is still fairly lean (48:40) organization. I'm talking about the BTD, the Biotech Division where we have 40,000 products that we make and sell in this division alone and mostly in little tubes. And we don't have a lot of limbs in place yet. We don't have a lot of barcoding. We don't have a lot of \u2013 or any RFID. There's a lot of things and steps we can do yet I think in \u2013 further improve our turns and our \u2013 our visibility of what we have. So, that's all yet to come \u2013 and save money. I mean, there's (49:07) productivity yet to come. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: One thing I'll bring up that you guys haven't brought up and that's just the strength of BTD is really something you should notice. I mean, to have a 10% quarter in this division and we have \u2013 our Protein Platforms is at north of 15%, 16% growth. It's not happened since I've been here. Our antibodies have always been pretty strong and they remain strong. But our assays and proteins have really, really taken off and done well. The strategies that we had done to go upstream in proteins remain the worldwide leader in this category have really started to prove themselves. And as you know, in terms of gross margin, proteins aren't too bad. So it's an area we want to keep focused on. We seem to be defending our ELISA platform pretty well and still, when you look at the whole assay platform together with Luminex and with our Simple Plex all-in, all our assays, the reason we did these acquisitions to protect or/and defend and have a next-year extension \u2013 next-generation extension to ELISA are double digit growth. So, the stuff in the core is really starting to work and that's why you're seeing us get ahead of 10%. It isn't just ACD and PPD : it's BTD as well. Operator : We can now take our next question from Paul Knight from Janney Montgomery. Please go ahead. Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Hi, Chuck. Could you go over what was going on in China, specifically what \u2013 did you say the growth rate there was 30%? And then could you go over \u2013 there was I guess a corruption probe. Again, can you give us a little color and history what happened and why so good now? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Yeah. Sure. About a year-and-a-half ago now, we \u2013 three years ago, we bought PrimeGene. We bought PrimeGene to have, really proteins in China, China for China. We built out their factory, made it GMP \u2013 it's the only GMP proteins factory in China and really focused on growth and, you know, really going after things like Bio Production, biosimilar development. All the things are going to happen there, cell culture development, et cetera, stem cell, et cetera, and supporting hospitals. And the initial business where all the momentum was back then was in immunotherapeutics (51:23) hospital. A little cultural detail on China : hospitals do their own research; hospitals sell their own therapies. And up until recently, they could do so without any FDA approval. And then somebody died a year-and-a- half ago : and the government cracked down. And this came a year or two after the other crackdowns they had done for corruption. So this isn't really a corruption crackdown : this is more about a process crackdown and giving the CFDA the hooks it was asking for to get in the middle of this. And so, they cut off all the hospitals. They said, you' re done : nobody's selling anymore until you get CFDA approval. So, our PrimeGene business literally (51:58) went to zero. And then as they've stepped up and given certifications hospital by hospital, our business has been picking up. Our growth in China now, PrimeGene 20% and overall 30% is more \u2013 it's more about annualizing the event, and it's about it all coming back, right? It's going to take years for all that PrimeGene business to come back. We're still focused on having business areas outside of immunotherapeutics in hospitals, that's why you see \u2013 that's why you saw 20% growth in PrimeGene. Even though we have very little back yet, I'd say we are 20% back probably on the hospital side for immunotherapeutics. But the core business, the \u2013 our new systems branded reagents are going to everything else in China, including bioprocessing has been on a tear and it's still on a tear at 30% So, they are a little bit separate. The whole thing obviously is a portfolio, and we want to keep pounding on China for China and biosimilars, bioprocessing, et cetera and things that are leading to infectious disease solutions and vaccines. Vaccine growth in China is nothing short of spectacular. So, it's where we want to be focusing on. The business for the company was roughly $12 million to $14 million when I joined and it's north of $40 million now. So, good growth, but not that big yet. We got a long way to go in China. So, we see a 25% growth in China, I would like to say, forever, so... Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Okay. And then, Chuck, you acquired a media company lately. Can you talk to your strategy there, and what you think about what you want to be in the media market? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Well, it's not to take over Gibco tomorrow or anything like that. We sell growth factors to virtually everybody in this segment and in Bio Production in general and you know that. But we're kind of downstream quite a ways, right? So, we're trying to increase our critical mass. We even sell some very nichey stem cell media and quite a few different offerings. And so we've been dancing around this area for quite some time. We did take a shot at buying HyClone a few years ago in fact. So, we know it fits, we know our brand fits, we know how to deal with it. We have a lot of experts in-house in it. And the whole franchise of cell culture is something that's very strategic to us. So, both Trevigen and Atlanta makes sense. They were done with very nice multiples, very nice deals. The ownership loved our company and we had great relationships, so we were able to really walk away with something really nice. And the synergies go well beyond the U.S. very quickly. So, as I mentioned, phase one is to really extend these product offerings within our total bag with our current salespeople and our \u2013 to our contacts, those customers overseas, Asia in particular. And as we grow this platform, we're going to get more and more into this space, especially obviously in China and potentially India, so... Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Thank you very much, Chuck. Congratulations. Operator : The last question is from Dan Arias from Citi. Please go ahead. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Jim, Chuck, just wanted to get your view on the Yuling step back and taking more \u2013 I think he's doing more of a consultancy role for ACD going forward. What was the strategy behind that and what's the plan going forward? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Well, wasn't a strategy, was Yuling's decision. I always expect a founder to leave, usually within the first year. We had contracted, where \u2013 agree with Yuling, he'd stay on at least a year-and-a-half, maybe two years full time and run the business. And he also wanted to see what he could do under me and my team's leadership of learning a little more about running and growing a business from a start-up into a real business. I've been (55:57) we plan on making ACD a Division next summer and it still has the growth and size to do that. In this timeframe, Yuling has been great. Yuling has decided that, nice experience that \u2013 and he walked away with quite a bit of pocket change in this deal and he's decided to look at being in the VC world and other things, but also keep his hands in this with us and help us. So he's contracted as a consultant \u2013 at least for the next year, maybe hopefully longer, we'll see. And working on next-generation roadmap product ideas. And that's where his focus is. He hasn't been the day-to-day on the current products and commercial operations really for quite some time actually, so... Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Helpful. Thanks. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: He's \u2013 at the end of the day, he's a scientist. He is a very creative scientist and \u2013 they tend to get bored. And the new leadership has been there, right. He's been Head of Commercial. This is \u2013 Tom O'Lenic is the guy who \u2013 he was in Molecular Devices, he actually ran Molecular Devices for a short time as well, known by everybody in the industry, commercially, and he's the right guy. The team wants him. He's got the \u2013 he's very strong technically as well \u2013 at least compared to me anyway, and we're just ecstatic that he's staying on and assume the reins of the overall organization. Using him (57:22) great and so is using (57:25) pick as well. So, as I mentioned earlier, probably the smoothest transition and integration I've really ever had for me (57:32). Operator : There are no further questions in the line at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to the host for any additional remarks. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Well, that's great. We actually went the whole hour. I think that's a first. So, anyway thanks everybody for listening in and good luck with today in the market. We'll talk to you soon. Bye. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. Ladies and gentlemen, you may now disconnect.",

Tables reconciling these measures to most comparable GAAP measures are available in the company's press release issued earlier this morning and on the Bio-Techne Corporation website at www.bio-techne.com. I'll now turn the call over to Chuck. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Thanks, Jim; and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter conference call. Following exceptionally high growth quarter in Q2, I'm happy to report that Q3 with another solid quarter, keeping our year-to-date performance on track with our expectations for fiscal year 2018. The company delivered 7% organic revenue growth in the third quarter with growth continuing to be broad-based by product category, region and end-market. The one exception was our Biologics product line within our Protein Platforms Division, which had the toughest comps in the company with over 40% growth in the third quarter last year and nearly 30% growth in the first half of fiscal 2018. Our performance is strong on the bottom line as well with Q3 adjusted operating margins expanding 80 basis points over last year and a record adjusted EPS of $1.21 per share. Europe continued to deliver terrific results with Q3 organic growth in the high-single-digits. The full integration of ACD commercial operations with our European subsidiary was completed in the quarter, now with a single point of reference for order processing and distribution in the region. ACD sales teams have also been integrated with the rest of our European sales force, which should lead to acceleration of ACD's RNAscope customer allocation in the region, similar to what we have seen with Protein Platforms products after their integration with the Biotech sales force a couple of years ago. We now have over 150 employees in Europe with half of those in commercial. Also in Q3, we expanded our European subsidiary model by acquiring our primary distributor for blood control products in Europe. For our Diagnostics Division, this will be our new model to sell directly into the local EMEA market, using local resources. In addition to blood control products, we'll be looking to sell more of the entire Diagnostics Division products directly in Europe. Following a similar and successful venture with our Italian distributor, Space, in 2016, this model has been a proven way to accelerate our geographical expansion by adding skilled resources and infrastructure in those markets where we have not directly been present before. We have been talking about the strength of our subsidiary business model in Europe for many quarters now and our strong results bear this out. The synergies at cross-selling and commercial collaboration have been apparent here and we expect the model to benefit both ACD and our Diagnostics Division. As in Europe, our Asia region also broadly delivered great results in Q3. In China, growth of our products is over 20% in Q3, in line with our long-term expectations. Jim and I visited our China team, customers and business development prospects in March and came away as enthusiastic as ever about the long-term prospects for our industry, and, more importantly, our company in China. We are expanding our offices in both Shanghai and Beijing and building a new demo lab for ACD (04:02) in Beijing. The rest of Asia also performed very well in the quarter with Japan growing in the high-single-digits and the rest of APAC growing in the low-teens. Although a very small portion of our business today, we see India with its emerging and rapidly growing presence in biosimilars is a large opportunity in the future of Bio-Techne. In Q3, we took steps to strengthen our presence in the region by creating a local Indian subsidiary, with a country manager and salespeople to continue to invest in commercial activities and capture more of that opportunity. In the U.S., growth in the quarter was also broad in most of our product categories and end-markets. Strength in academic continued from what we experienced in Q2 with growth over 10%. The macro NIH funding environment is certainly a plus right now, but we're also executing well and leveraging investments we have made in online content, marketing and e-commerce capability. With the variability we had experienced with the Protein Platforms Biologics product line the past two quarters, we have seen similar variability in the BioPharma end-market, particularly in the U.S. In Q3, the U.S. BioPharma end-market grew low-single-digits; however, excluding the Biologics product line, growth for the quarter was high-single-digits. Also when you look at our growth in the U.S. BioPharma market year-to-date, it stands at 10%. Thus, we believe the BioPharma end-market in the U.S. is still doing very well for us and expect it will continue for some time. As we have said for many quarters now, the underlying market trends in both our BioPharma and academic end-markets remain strong. Now, for some more color on our Q3 performance by division. Our Biotech Division grew 7% organically in Q3, which brings its organic growth rate year-to-date to 9%, results that haven't been seen in a decade. Biotech's core products continue to perform very well with collective growth in the mid-single-digits. Stand-outs for the quarter continue to be our proteins, cell culture products, immunoassays and Novus-branded antibodies, all growing in the high-single-digits or higher in the case of our assay portfolio which is growing low-double-digits. New product innovation has been the key to the long-term success for our protein cell culture portfolio. As an example, this innovation can be found with the new product line we released in Q3 called MimEX GI. The MimEX GI platform is an innovative human tissue model system that utilizes the unique characteristics of adult ground-state stem cells to generate 3-D gastrointestinal epithelial tissue on a 2-D surface. 3-D cell culture and organoid models of the gastrointestinal epithelium are quickly being adopted for a variety of therapeutic research uses. Researchers using current 3-D models such as gastrointestinal organoids often experience difficulties with model variability, tissue viability, and experimental accessibility. Overcoming these obstacles is paramount for the logistical incorporation of 3-D tissues into high throughput toxicity and disease modeling workflows. Thus, the MimEX GI platform makes in vivo-like 3-D gastrointestinal tissue broadly accessible to both academic and industrial laboratories. Having better tools to study cell behavior is physiologically relevant \u2013 in physiologically relevant environments and high quality reagents increases researchers' confidence in the experimental findings. New innovative platforms like MimEX GI and our recent acquisitions of both Atlanta Biologics (sic) [Atlanta Biologicals] (07:16) and Trevigen, and its BME, basement membrane extract product line are excellent examples of how we are expanding our franchise in the cell culture, and, together, serving our customers more completely by leveraging Bio-Techne sales channels. With regards to assay, our recent success has, in part, been attributed to our commercial cross-platform immunoassay workflow campaign, whether it's dual-effects that are used in basic research, our gold standard single analyzer kits that are used as a performance benchmark for all other assays, high-quality multiplex assay needs or automated high sensitivity and reproducibility assay needs in the form of SimplePlex that is reported through our Protein Platforms and growing year-to-date nearly 100%. Bio-Techne has the broadest and highest quality assay platforms that give our customers choice in selecting a solution they need, and we are getting noticed. In antibodies, Bio-Techne was honored with the prestigious 2018 Cite Antibody [CiteAb] Award for Researchers' Choice. The Cite Antibody Awards aim to celebrate the very best suppliers and individuals in the research reagent sector worldwide and truly reflects what researchers think about the companies they use for their research. It was noted that Bio-Techne brands, including R&D Systems and Novus Biologicals, stood out for judges in this category, receiving numerous nominations for researchers around the world, outlining the excellent quality of products and standards of service they've experienced. And finally, there is ACD that continued its streak of rapid market adoption in Q3 with nearly 30% organic growth. The growth is terrific considering the big push that occurred in Q2 when they hit their $45 million annual earn-out milestone. ACD continued to expand its addressable market of its popular RNAscope in situ hybridization ISH technology with the launch of several new and improved assays with automation capabilities in Q3. The developments increased both access to and use of RNAscope, along with improving overall robustness and ease of use. We now sell over 15,000 different probes. The continued investment in automation builds on successful agreements with equipment providers and is driven by our desire to facilitate drug discovery and development via rapid, easy and accurate gene expression detection and localization. Moving on to Protein Platforms, the overall results in Q3 with 4% organic growth was not what we would like, but healthier than it may appear on the surface. With the exception of Biologics, all the divisions' major product categories, including Simple Western, SimplePlex, and Single Cell Western experienced solid double-digit growth in the third quarter. However, as I stated in my opening comments, Biologics has been leading the division with double-digit growth the past few years and faced a very tough comp in Q3. Perhaps a breather was in order. Year-to-date, the Biologics platform and the Protein Platforms Division overall have performed very well, racking up 20% organic growth over last year. The sales funnel for all Protein Platforms instruments is robust, and we still expect to see at least 15% growth for the division in fiscal 2018 and for years beyond. As we have said many times before, the market for Protein Platforms solutions are collectively approaching $2 billion, and we still have less than a 5% share. Thus, there's plenty of runway for continued double-digit growth well into the future. Next, our Diagnostics Division rebounded in Q3 with timing of orders this time contributing 7% organic growth in the quarter. Looking at 12-month trailing revenue growth for the division, which smooth outs the choppiness of large OEM orders, quarter-to-date revenue growth has been 6%, in line with the same growth rate of our hematology controls products in Q3, which gives us better insight into the current end-users demand given these products' short shelf life. Finally, I would like to comment on our strong operational income and EPS performance in Q3. We outperformed our expectations for adjusted operating margin due to solid productivity from our teams and a more favorable mix of robust high margin Biotech product sales. Adjusted EPS reflects this strong operational performance, but also includes nice tailwinds from tax reform and foreign exchange. We are very happy to remain on track with our strategic thesis towards 40% operating margins by 2021. In our GAAP reported earnings, we recognized a before tax $16 million impairment charge against our investments in Astute Medical. You will recall about 16 months ago we made a $40 million equity investment in this early-stage diagnostic company, focused on hospital-acquired acute conditions that require rapid diagnosis and risk assessment. As part of the investment, Bio-Techne will receive certain manufacturing rights for future products and royalties on diagnostic tests that contain Bio-Techne reagents. During Q3, Astute's board decided to sell the company with investment banker leading the process. While we still believe in Astute's underlying technology and need for acute kidney injury prevention in hospitals, it was our assessment that the investment required going forward to successfully bring this diagnostic to market did not meet our return on capital requirement. Thus, we ultimately passed on further participating in the sales process. And Astute was eventually sold to another party. We still maintain our manufacturing and royalty rights received as part of our original investment, which we intend to capitalize on. And we hope for a bright future for Astute under its new ownership as well as for the thousands of potential patients that their NephroCheck Test can help to prevent acute kidney injury while in a hospital for medical care. As Jim will point out when he covers the details of our Q3 financial performance, we have other investments that are performing exceptionally well, even if not reflected directly in our earnings. Jim? James T. Hippel - Bio-Techne Corp.: That's right, Chuck. Thanks. But, first, I'll provide an overview of our Q3 financial performance for the total company and then provide some color on each of our three segments. Starting with the overall third quarter financial performance, adjusted EPS increased 25% to $1.21, while GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.52 compared to $0.59 in the prior year. The decrease in GAAP EPS is driven by the impairment charge on our investment in Astute that Chuck mentioned, which had an impact of approximately $0.32. Q3 reported revenue was $164 million, an increase of 14% year-over-year, with organic revenue increasing 7%. Third quarter reported sales include a 3% growth contribution from acquisitions and a 4% contribution from favorable foreign exchange translation. Organic growth year-to-date for the fiscal year is nearly 10%, by far the best since this management teams come to Bio-Techne. By geography, the U.S. grew in the mid-single-digits, with BioPharma growth in the low-single-digits and academic growing over 10%. As Chuck noted, excluding Protein Platforms Biologics product line, growth in the BioPharma and the U.S. region overall was in the high-single-digits for the quarter. Europe's organic growth continue to be strong at high-single-digit growth overall, with the BioPharma end-markets growing in the mid-single-digits and academic growing over 10%, as it did in the U.S. In Asia, China's organic growth was over 20% in the third quarter, while Japan grew in the high-single-digits and the rest of Asia-Pac grew in the low-teens. Note that all references made to growth rates by region and end-markets exclude our OEM sales, which mostly occur in our Diagnostics segment, and, to a lesser extent, our Biotech segment. Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin was 72% in Q3, up approximately 120 basis points from the prior year due to volume leverage, operational productivity and favorable FX, partially offset by lower margin acquisitions. Adjusted SG&A in Q3 was 25.5% of revenue, 160 basis points higher than last year, but down 70 basis points sequentially from last quarter. The SG&A increase was driven by the timing of investments made in the core business to support growth and from the additional SG&A of our recent acquisitions. R&D expense in Q3 was 8.5% of revenue, down 110 basis points from prior year due to volume leverage. The resulting adjusted operating margin for Q3 was 38.1%, an increase of approximately 80 basis points from the prior-year period. Looking at our numbers below operating income, net interest expense in Q3 was $2.3 million, compared to $2 million of net interest expense last year. The higher interest expense is driven by multiple rate increases in the past year on our outstanding line of credit. Other non-operating income for the quarter was $0.5 million compared to $0.3 million net spent in the prior year quarter. The year-over-year change is due to transactional FX gains this year, which did not occur in the prior year quarter. Also included in other non-operating for GAAP purposes is $16.2 million impairment charge on our investment in Astute. As Chuck mentioned, an agreement to sell the company was signed in Q3, triggering the timing of the impairment charge. The transaction closed in the first week of April and we have since received $22.5 million of net proceeds. There remains another $1.3 million held in escrow, net of allowance reserve. Our adjusted effective tax rate in Q3 was approximately 24%, over a 5 percentage point improvement from the prior year due to tax reform. For the remainder of fiscal year 2018, we still expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be around 25% plus or minus 100 basis points. In terms of returning capital, we continue to pay our dividend and paid out $12 million in the quarter. Average diluted shares increased less than 2% over the year-ago period at 38.1 million shares outstanding. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, $21.6 million of cash was generated from operations in the third quarter and our investment in capital expenditures was $3.5 million. We also made approximately $56 million in new M&A investment during the quarter associated with the acquisitions of Atlanta Biologics (sic) [Atlanta Biologicals] (16:48) and Eurocell. As Chuck reminded us in his commentary, ACD achieved their revenue milestone at the end of Q2 and the resulting $50 million earn-out was paid in Q3. For GAAP purposes on the statement of cash flows, a portion of the earn-out is charged to the cash flow from operations, while the remainder is recorded as a financing activity. Management view the earn-out as well as the purchase price paid for the acquisition of ACD, thus management view the cash outflow as an investment rather than operational and financing cash activity. Excluding the acquisition earn-out payment for ACD, our adjusted cash flow from operations for the quarter was $47.8 million, up 42% over the same quarter last year. Year-to-date, our adjusted cash flow from operations stands at $131.7 million, which is 30% higher than at this point in time last year. Both the Q3 and year-to-date adjusted operating cash flow demonstrate the strong quality of our earnings. On our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $176.4 million of cash and short-term available for sale investment. Included in that figure is our investment in ChemoCentryx, which had a market value of over $86 million at the end of Q3, representing a nearly $55 million before-tax built-in gain. Currently, GAAP requires changes in valuation of investments in publicly traded securities to be reflected in the equity section of the balance sheet until the investment is sold. Our long-term debt obligations at the end of Q3 stood at $392.5 million, up $30 million from the end of Q2 as we drew down our line of credits to partially fund the ACD earn-out paid during the quarter. Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio as defined by our bank debt covenants stands at approximately 1.4 times EBITDA. Going forward, our capital deployment priorities remain opportunistic M&A, our dividend and debt paydown. Now, I'll discuss the performance of our three business segments, starting with the Biotechnology segment. Q3 reported sales were $110 million with reported revenue increasing 16%, acquisitions contributed 4% to revenue growth, foreign exchange contributed 5% and organic growth was 7% with solid growth across all major product categories. Year-to-date, organic growth for the segment stands at 9%. Operating margin for the Biotech segment was 48.2%, an increase of 20 basis points year-over-year. Core Biotech operating margin increased 60 basis points over last year, while operating margin contribution from ACD's products was in the mid-teens compared to a slight operating loss in the prior year. Strong volume leverage partially offset by portfolio mix, strategic investments to support growth and the impact from recent acquisitions drove the margin expansion. Turning to the Protein Platforms segment, net sales in Q3 were $25.5 million, a total increase of 8% from the prior-year period. Organic growth for the segment was 4%, with currency translation having a favorable impact of 4%. Double-digit growth was experienced in all major product categories with the exception of Biologics, which had a very difficult comp this quarter considering it grew 40% in the same quarter last year. Year-to-date, organic growth for the segment stands at 20%. Operating margin for the Protein Platforms segment was 9.6%, down from 13.8% reported last year. The lower adjusted operating margin was driven by the timing of additional investments in global commercial resources and administrative infrastructure, which has supported the segment's year-to-date 20% organic revenue growth. The operating margin for the segment year-to-date is 14.6%, 640 basis points better than at the same point last year and we expect it will continue to improve from here. Moving on to our Diagnostics segment, reported revenue in Q3 was $28.5 million with reported growth over 9%. Organic growth increased 7% from the prior year, while acquisitions contributed 2%. As Chuck explained in his comments, the timing of OEM shipments was more favorable this quarter and the segment's more run rate-based hematology controls product category experienced similar growth in the mid-single-digit. At 28%, the Diagnostics segment operating margin improved dramatically from prior quarter and compared to prior year was up over 500 basis points. The margin improvement was due to volume leverage and favorable OEM product mix. We expect margins to be similar in Q4 for this segment as we close out the fiscal year. In summary for the quarter, our breadth of growth continues to be solid, both in terms of end-market and product category. We've talked about Protein Platforms Biologics products as being the exception, but given the extremely tough comps this product category faced in Q3, we are not deterred by its continued growth potential. The double-digit growth rates we've come to expect from Protein Platforms we believe are far from over. Our operational profitability was in line with our expectations, even slightly ahead due to the favorable mix of Biotech segment revenue growth this quarter. Our very strong cash flow performance demonstrated the quality of our earnings. On the bottom-line, tax reform continues to be a real positive for Bio-Techne and will bolster our future cash flows and enhance our strategy of investing for growth, both internally and externally as the opportunity arises. Our view for the remainder of the fiscal year and the rest of calendar year 2018 remains upbeat. Our end-markets are healthy on a global basis and our teams are executing very well. Thus we expect, overall company organic growth rates to remain in the high-single-digit range. With regard to profitability, as we close our fiscal year 2018, our view hasn't changed in the past several quarters. Total company adjusted operating margins should sequentially rise in Q4 as it did in Q3 and be on par, if not slightly ahead, of last year's margin performance. That concludes my prepared comments. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Chuck before we open the line for questions. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Thanks, Jim. Before we go to questions I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the announcement we made last week regarding a new executive who joined the Bio-Techne team on Monday. Kim Kelderman will be our new President of Diagnostics and Genomics and will lead the group, including our Diagnostics business, while also developing our strategic initiatives in Genomics and Genomics-based diagnostics. As you've heard me say many times before, in addition to our current Diagnostics Division, which focuses on providing the tools that help make our Diagnostics OEM customers successful, our company has many opportunities to participate on a Grander Scale in the diagnostics market. We are a global leader in assay development, both in proteomics, but now also in genomics with ACD. Kim will be tasked to developing a strategic roadmap that will bridge our renowned excellence in assays and reagents for the research and hospital markets into that of the diagnostics market. This could result in future reorganization of some of our business structure and/or heightened acquisition focused on external diagnostic and genomic targets. Kim Kelderman is joining Bio-Techne from Thermo Fisher where he led three different businesses of increasing scale and complexity. Most recently, he managed the platforms and content of the Genetic Science Division, which has revenues well over $1 billion. Before joining Thermo Fisher, Kim served as a senior segment leader at Becton Dickinson and worked also for a start-up molecular diagnostics company which Becton Dickinson acquired in 2006. I hired Kim during my time at Thermo Fisher, and I know first-hand the strong global perspective he brings to our leadership team and what a catalyst he is for positive change in people and in business processes. He is an excellent change agent and operating executive. And I'm very excited to have Kim on board, and he will be a great addition to our executive team. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'll open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. And we'll go first to Dan Arias at Citi. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey, good morning. Thank you. Chuck, maybe I'll just start on Biologics. Obviously, a pharma-focused business there, tough comp, and you saw some good activity in calendar 4Q. Do you think this was sort of a catch-up on that? What are you feeling like the pause in Biologics kind of specifically was all about? And what do you think about the rebound potential for that piece next quarter? Do you have visibility there at all? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: We have some, and of course we've been digging into it. We had some \u2013 as you know, it's lumpier, being this is the most expensive income platform that we have. And a lot of these sales come at the very end of the quarter. At the very end of the quarter, is also the latest budget signature and there were some fallouts there. We also had, we feel, some pull in from the previous quarter. We had well over 30% growth last quarter in that category and for the year, we're at 30% growth. So if it happens two three, four quarters in a row, yeah, we've got more to worry about, but I'm not worried at all. This is nothing like the first year after we acquired Protein Platforms, where everything was kind of off and we had issues at Simple Western and really everything across the board. This is the only blip, we think it's short-term, we do think we'll end the year strong, double-digit, 15-plus north. And we do think that, as Jim outlined, our markets \u2013 our share positions are still so small, I think there's no issue. And we do \u2013 this is one different platform that we have though, compared to like Simple Western and others, where we have really kind of unique and fundamental IP. Here, we compete and we're competing against some big guys. And we've been doing so well on taking share the last couple years, they've woken up a little bit. So we've got to compete a little better, we've got to do a little bit harder work in promoting. And that's underway, and then we actually have a pretty strong start this quarter, but we'll see. We're not too concerned to be honest. But I'd be more concerned if Simple Western we're off at flat, but that's still heavy double-digit. And we're still seeing the acceleration in that whole platform as we get critical mass to be honest, so. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Right. Okay, maybe to that point, I mean you \u2013 one of the things you talked about is just penetration on the academic and the pharma side of that market, are you seeing better penetration on the academic side, which I think is a little bit more price sensitive? And can you just talk about how the sales process is going when you think about customer sensitivities for the Simple products? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Well, to be really frank, we're still kind of astounded how well we're doing in academic markets. And that's from a lot of reasons, great execution and great website execution, great e-commerce execution. The collaboration in our channels with our direct sales force is helping a lot there. And then Fisher is helping a lot. So Fisher has kind of been back on track. All told, it's high-single-digit, close to 10%-ish, which is \u2013 we just haven't ever been there just since this past year. So the blip, as Jim pointed out in BioPharma, was really almost all the Biologics. And we're talking a couple million bucks here, that's really all that fell out, and hopefully get that all back here. But you take that out, we're still high-single-digits in BioPharma as well. We've seen a nice recovery there from about a year ago now when we had timing issues with assays and ELISA. That's all fairly strong again. Our assay category SimplePlex, SimplePlex is growing 85% year-to-date. We expect that to be a 50% \u2013 a north of 50% growth platform going forward as it gets more and more critical mass. And this is the end of the fiscal year be close to \u2013 probably not \u2013 quite close to a $15 million business. So it's starting to become real material to our company. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. If I could just ask one more on the margin outlook. Jim, nice improvement this quarter. I know we're not talking about next year yet, but it does seem like at least organically the business is in a place to start seeing some profitability gains as the smaller businesses mature a bit. Is that a fair way to think about things as you start to sort of contemplate periods beyond 2018? James T. Hippel - Bio-Techne Corp.: It is. I mean, we're just now starting to get into our planning process, our detailed planning process for next year. But the expectations that we're setting for our team going forward, when you add it all up from a total company perspective, hopefully I'd say modest margin expansion next year, but somewhere in the 50 basis point range. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks very much. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Thanks, Dan. The issue to keep your eye on though, is our strategic thesis of getting back to 40% by 2021. And the last couple quarters, we've been talking about being a little bit ahead of plan on there. And then this quarter was no exception, a strong mix, a strong performance and then Biotech gave us an extra uplift here. So we're thrilled to be over 38%. Operator : And we'll take the next question from Dan Leonard at Deutsche Bank. Mike Sarcone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, guys. This is Mike Sarcone on for Dan Leonard. Good morning. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Morning. Mike Sarcone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So my first question just on China. Can you give us a little bit more color on the performance there? And then also comment on any exposure you might have to potential trade tariffs with China? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Yeah. We have very little trade tariff. We have some on our small molecule section, but we can be moving that to its origin from \u2013 to its source origin, which is our \u2013 which is Bristol, England. So we don't have a lot of concern on tariffs at all. We're not that big in China anyway to be honest. So we're knocking the door, being a $50 million business there, which is up a lot in four, five years from $10 million, $12 million, but the growth rate is north of 20%. We've, starting last quarter really back on track, annualized the issues we have behind us concerning the Baidu scandal and the erosion due to the immunotherapeutic integration product for hospital markets in China. So that's all good. Our core products, R&D branded systems are all growing quite well. We're actually seeing really nice growth beginning again with our PrimeGene brand China for China strategy, even outside of just therapeutic areas. So a pretty good story right there, right now. Mike Sarcone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Thank you. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: As well as in Japan (30:35). High-single-digit, we continue to be rolling in Japan. We're happy about that and APAC was double-digit. So Asia's all good right now. Mike Sarcone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks. And then, just on (30:49) you guys had nice performance this quarter in both the U.S. and internationally. Can you just comment on the sustainability of growth there in your outlook? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Well, let me start with Japan, because everyone's worried about Japan doing some flip-flop on us. We had a couple of good solid years of, let's just call it out, straight erosion in Japan and we've been coming back pretty strong. A lot of it's coming from our products and our integration of products into the stem cell markets, in cell culture markets in Japan. We're obviously affiliated with the IPS stem cell areas as well and all that's \u2013 actually, it's just doing really, really well and I think their budgets are decent finally once they've got their AMED process in place. The rest of Asia is strong. Biosimilars in Asia are really helping us as well as helping everybody, right. So we're strong in Korea, we're strong in China and we're starting to get going and get traction in India. We have a 60%-plus growth targets in India for the foreseeable future and it's small base. So with my team, it should probably be higher. So it's all pretty good story. Europe, it's high-single-digits, it's been good, it's still already largely related to execution and continued collaboration and integration of our teams. We're now bringing Diagnostics Division people into the family fold over there and that's working quite well, too. I think as far as I know, the funding and the project timing with Biotech, there's a lot more Biotech for us in Europe. All remains pretty strong, pretty healthy as the timing of our projects is pretty healthy. If we are probably off anywhere, we're probably off a little bit in timing of some OEM areas and we had some really large orders a year ago in SimplePlex and cartridges, so that's why we didn't have quite as high numbers in SimplePlex which also deterred the overall number for Protein Platforms and we're still well north of 20% growth. And we're at 85% for the year. So we're not concerned either with that. So all told, we see our market's holding pretty well. U.S., also I think, we mentioned in our comments, NIH funding is obviously very good right now. I think just the acceleration of our brand and our image and our critical mass and our commercial sales force is all working very well. Biotech is \u2013 if you look back last couple of years in Biotech, we just are getting better and better and better back in our home turf and the R&D Systems brand is a gold standard and we're leveraging and it's working. Mike Sarcone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : And we'll move next to Puneet Souda at Leerink Partners. Puneet Souda - Leerink Partners LLC : Yeah. Hi, Chuck. Thanks for taking the question. So my first question is around just Biologics. I just want to get a bit more clarity. Is this squarely MFI and iCE platforms? And you mentioned competition there, so could you elaborate on that? Are these more sophisticated technologies like LC-MS or UVs that are coming in here competing? Or what's your sense? And how do you get back to those growth rates, given the potential competition there? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: It's entirely in iCE and it's partially iCE, partially Maurice, the new platform, right. So when we've launched Maurice, it had both size and charge. Historically, we're a charge-based instrument and our competition had both, right? And so we went after them, they worked quite well of taking some share. We also took the iCE280 out of service, which also gave us probably some more uptick there maybe a year-and-a-half, two years ago. So there's some of that as well. Where we're seeing the competition has been one large company, it's Beckman Coulter who really is the more or less the process of record where we compete and that's where we haven't taken share, they have out-shared us by a large margin. So we still feel very confident of continuing to work towards growing. It is a great market. I think there's room for growth for everybody us, including no matter what happens, but they are competing more \u2013 the last quarter here we see in price \u2013 like I said, they've kind of woken up, they see us now becoming more of a threat because we are, it's becoming a sizable business. There is also competition in other existing applications like HPLC where we also can use the instruments in processes. So there's some of that happening as well. And then there's other integration that we have to get this instrument platform more mainstream, in more Lim's environments, like Impalas and Chameleon stuff, that's in development. So all that's happening, we're not that concerned, not yet anyway. I think it's more of a blip when you come off the results we've had the last year in this platform. It stands to reason. And again, I'll point it out, we were at 33% growth in this division last quarter. There was definitely little bit of pull ahead. So I think that stands to reason. Now, if we show flat to 4% next quarter, it'll be a different discussion, but we don't see that right now. I think it will be much healthier. Puneet Souda - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. Okay. Thanks for that. And on ACD, I just wanted to get a clarity, this is the 30% in the quarter. What your expectations are of near to midterm here? And what's your sense on the sales force overall? Are you happy with the sales force makeup right now and is that enough to drive accelerated growth here? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: I think you've got to remember a couple of things. We had with the team locally calls the Super Bowl event just occurred. So we had an 18 months' full team, full court pressed towards the $45 million milestone. And with our management, and we've had a management transition since that milestone has been achieved. So we have to transition to new leadership there from Tom, and get everybody back on track that we didn't win the game, it's not over, it's just one innings of you guys and it's great you hit your milestone, and you're all getting paid. But we got to stay on top of things. So there's a little bit of that. And I think we're through them. We still perform at 30% growth. To be honest, I thought it could be much worse given there were clearly pull ahead to go as there always is in reaching milestone, right. People are always going to do that, we're just human. So going forward, we still see it, and we've been saying it, it's a 35% plus game for quite some time. I'd like to say 40%, I'd say it's 35% to 40% until we know more about our process going forward. But it should be north of 30% for sure. So we think it's quite healthy, it's still a big, big area. We have new applications coming with the platform. We are obviously accelerating with the automation partners in Diagnostics. So it's a very good story. It remains \u2013 it was this quarter, it will remain to be so. Puneet Souda - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. And then, just last one on... Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: You said they're hiring too. They're probably a little better on track this quarter in hiring versus last quarter. And we're pushing on that. So there are about 160 people, which is a little over double when we bought them. And for this coming year, we expect them to add 20, 25, 30 people, probably largely commercial and technically FAS is commercial. Puneet Souda - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks for the color. And just last one, you already have a great collaboration with Leica here, could you update us where do you stand with VENTANA right now, obviously that's the larger piece of the market? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Well, we're still working with them and we're working both sides top-down with the management as well as bottoms-up with shaming them to come to the table by basically using our FASes in the field to tune in their instruments to use our products and then we have their either customers to go back to VENTANA saying we need to have this integrated, because it worked really great. So that's all working pretty well and there is (38:31) we're talking to. I do believe this will be a standard in a few years. And if it remains for them to become great partners in automation or we'll do automation ourselves, so one or the other. So the growth is there, the profits are there, this is north of 80% growth margin kind of platform as we've talked about. So there's plenty to work with there to build this into a very, very fulfilling division of the company. And obviously, we're not afraid of any instruments. So we'll take care of ourselves if we have to. But so far so good with Leica, we're quite friendly with the executives there as well as the Danaher and General of course, so. I've got great hopes and I do hope VENTANA will come on board more seriously as we go forward here. But not much yet, most of what we're getting at VENTANA is the work we're doing in the field with their machines with our people. Puneet Souda - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay, thanks. Thanks very helpful. Thank you. Operator : And moving next to Amanda Murphy at William Blair. Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. I actually have two sort of longer-term questions for you, Chuck. So I guess, starting with China. So obviously, a lot of growth there. And I'm just wondering if you can remind us how big of a business that is now and thinking forward over the next three to five years. So for some of your comparable companies, China is quite large as a percentage of revenues. So just wondering how big you think that business can become relative to the overall pie, if you will? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Yeah. Well, as I've mentioned many times and it's really one of the reasons I was hired here to begin with. I have a lot of experience in China, have run and built a lot of businesses in China. I love China. I go there three times a year. My entire executive team travels there quite a lot and all of them have experience in China. So taking that business from roughly $12 million five years ago to nearly $50 million now, as complete company, it's great, but it's still small, right, per our backgrounds. There's a lot \u2013 a long way to go. It will come through organic, it will come through acquisition. We are looking for more China to China acquisitions. The whole area knows our brand. We have all these sea turtles who went home that grew up here in the U.S., got their PhDs here, and worked 20 years here, then went home and have all this funding. They know R&D Systems, and that's why we continue to see 20%, 25%, 30% growth quarter-on-quarter. We have the PrimeGene China for China and we've worked our \u2013 through our blip there, that's on track. Even their business there has actually tripled in the last three years since we bought them. So taking out the therapeutic part of the business, that is coming back slowly with the CFDA approvals coming online. So I still remain bullish. I personally think we should be growing 30% plus. It's just, there's a lot of area, there's a lot of space. You can only grow so fast, you have to do it city by city, team by team, office by office. We're expanding heavily now in the Beijing, that office, and we'll expand there. All of our R&D in Asia and China, (41:33) is actually in Beijing, where most of our other critical masses are in Shanghai. So that'll be nice to start balancing things out. And we're doing more things in other cities now. We're getting more people into Hangzhou of course which is \u2013 there's a lot of excitement in Hangzhou these days and Shenzhen and other areas. So I still see easily 20% plus growth and hopefully 25%. So... Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. Okay. And then maybe one for Jim. So at the Analyst Day, I guess this was couple years ago or a year ago you guys outlined some longer-term targets. I think it was $850 million kind of with the current portfolio and $1 billion over a five-year period. I just was curious, fast forwarding now, how you're thinking about those numbers. Are you still comfortable with them? You've done a few smaller acquisitions and since then. So just trying to get an update on how you're kind of progressing to the longer-term goals in your mind? Thank you. James T. Hippel - Bio-Techne Corp.: Yeah. I'll just simply \u2013 sure. I'll just simply say, Amanda, that I think we're on track. I think we're right on track to where we want to be at this point in time to hit those goals. And we hope to actually beat them, but definitely on track at least meet them. Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : We'll go next to Catherine Schulte at Baird. Catherine Ramsey Schulte - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hey, guys. Thanks for the questions. I was just curious to get more details on the additional commercial and infrastructure investments you referenced making on the Protein Platforms side. Is that primarily a sales force expansion? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: It is probably across the board there. We've got four \u2013 actually six solid instrument platforms (43:46), and so we're continually beefing up our R&D in software areas. Getting compatible with Empower and Chameleon (43:56) takes more software people, so we're beefing up technically as well as commercially, and we've never stopped the pace commercially. So we're currently well over 300 employees and probably on our way to 400 in the next year to year and a half or so. And this was roughly 150 when we bought it, so more than double. We moved into a new building just as we bought the company and we still have plenty of room for expansion there as well. So we're good there, but it's a beautiful site and we're hiring and growing. Last quarter, we didn't hire enough and you saw that reflected in our numbers. And this quarter a little bit of catch-up there so but we're on track there. I'd rather focus on capturing growth and planning for the future with really good solid growth and getting the team in place than worrying about an extra point or two of margin on these accelerating businesses, so. Catherine Ramsey Schulte - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then any color on how the Trevigen and Atlanta acquisition performed in the quarter relative to your expectations? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Well, we had the usual thing that happens, you pick up something like this and you have to integrate into your distributors and there's obviously a little breakage there. We actually are quite happy with how things have transitioned. Atlanta is going quite well. I'm really excited about how fast that's transitioning in turn, because this is a little more \u2013 a little easier since it's U.S. only right now. So the big work becomes how we leverage and take these product lines globally, which we're working on. So they're both real small teams, but we've got our people in there. We're helping. They're already starting to build leverage, the bigger Bio-Techne is in front, and that's good and it's good for morale. And I'd just say stay tuned. The whole cell culture franchise they're working on is a top priority for the company. So we're continuing to look in that space. We're hopefully going to buy more things in that space and organically invest in that space, so. Catherine Ramsey Schulte - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : And we'll go next to Matt Hewitt at Craig-Hallum. Matthew G. Hewitt - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC : Good morning, gentlemen. Maybe blend a couple of the key topics so far in the Q&A, Asia and ACD, what are you seeing as far as an opportunity set there, where are you going to be driving more investment, particularly with ACD in Asia? And how do you see that playing out over the next few years? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Well, when you balance between 30% and 50% growth, it's where do you want to focus, everything growing on all cylinders. So I would say the potential \u2013 who is the farthest behind is the region is maybe your question, I would say Asia right now is the most potential. And we're expanding by percentage in head count the most there. And as I mentioned, we're putting in a demo center in Beijing, we're expanding the team there significantly. Europe always has been pretty good and is growing quite well, and then the U.S. is where the bigger market is, and we just have to keep feeding that at least. So it's been a good model, Tom Olynyk (46:36), running it has years experience in this company, in this field. And we have had very little turnover at all since the milestone, this is a Silicon Valley company, you meet your milestones and you worry about Valley people leaving, running to the next start-up, the next lottery ticket and we did much better than we thought in terms of attrition. So that's all very good. And then I'd just say stay tuned. Pretty much whatever they ask for right now which they're pretty concerned, we kind of give them. Matthew G. Hewitt - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : And we'll hear from Paul Knight next with Janney Montgomery Scott. Carolina Ibanez Ventoso - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Hi. This is Carolina Ibanez Ventoso for Paul Knight. A follow-up question on the expansion of addressable markets for ACD. I wonder what is the initial response from pathologists and if you can elaborate a bit more on your approach to penetrate the pathology market since this represents a new end-market for you? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Yeah. Well, it's important. I think the whole Diagnostics side of the business model, we think, Leica is to be honest has actually been slower than we'd like. We're still growing mostly probably in BioPharma and the products are being used really in the clinicals and checking out their drugs, so to speak. So great growth. We can design a probe for somebody in two weeks. We have over 15,000. So we continue to build on accounts of the business. We also will continue to build on new accounts. There's a lot of new business activity all the time. And that's why we have such focus on the commercial side of things. And it is an awareness issue, too, getting these pathologists and getting researchers in pathology \u2013 with drugs, with BioPharma to actually move from iCE from that type of pathology to molecular pathology is it takes great data and great results, which we have. I haven't checked the paper count, but it was 1,100 or so, maybe near 1,200 papers. It's exploding. The bottom line is these people get \u2013 especially the academics, they get a hold of stuff, they work so well. They want to write about it and show off their findings. And we outpaced every other area, including Protein Platforms in terms of paper. So that's a kind of \u2013 this is what we're looking for to help move the needle on adoption. And again, it's such a big market that there's plenty of room to grow here for quite some time we think so without automation and I made comments on automation. With automation, it's just going to get better. Carolina Ibanez Ventoso - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : And gentlemen, it looks like there are no additional questions at this time. I'll turn the program back over to you for any additional or concluding remarks. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: No. I guess, that's it for now. It was a pretty solid quarter for us we felt. We beat top and bottom line. We had great margins. We're ahead of schedule there. We have one area to work on obviously, but I'd rather have just that and have something across the board. We really have a very successful business and numbers year-to-date. This is going to be a banner year for this company. It's going to be a record year really on all cylinders. So hang tight, we're hoping for good Q4 and we'll talk to you then. Thanks. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, once again, that does conclude today's conference. And again, I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today.",

I'll now turn the call over to Chuck. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter conference call. As you saw in our press release, we ended the year in a strong note, and I am very pleased with our fourth quarter results, as well as the execution of our strategic plan all year. The company delivered 9% organic growth in the quarter and for the full-year of fiscal 2018 as well. Our two divisions have primarily served the life science research market, Biotechnology, and Protein Platforms collectively grew organically 12% in Q4 and 11% for the full year. It was a great year where we capitalized on the synergies from our acquisitions and a more unified selling model between our divisions. Our performance was strong and the bottom line as well with Q4 adjusted operating margins expanding 80 basis points over last year and a record adjusted EPS of $1.34 per share. By geography, Europe is first along with its unified selling model that combines reagents with instruments to sell full solutions to our academic and BioPharma customers. The results there have been terrific. And just as they did last year, Europe reported double-digit growth for the quarter and for the full fiscal year 2018. We are reaching critical mass on the continent with the team now 275 strong in full subsidiaries in the UK, France, Germany, and Italy. As in Europe, our Asia region also broadly delivered great results in Q4 and for the full year. In China, growth of our products was approximate 20% for both the quarter and the full year, just short of our long-term expectations. Meanwhile, the rest of Asia led by Korea and Japan grew in the mid-teens in both the fourth quarter and for the full year. India is now a legal entity for the company, and we are hiring fast to capitalize on the growing opportunity there. Asia seeks to be a leader in bioprocessing and biosimilars, and we have thousands of products designed for these markets. All this growth in Asia couldn't have happened without excellent collaboration and execution by our operations in the divisions and our commercial teams in the region. Here in the U.S., we finished with around 10% organic growth for both the quarter and the year. The academia end-market was strong for us all year with the macro NIH funding environment and tailwind right now. The BioPharma market rebounded from its brief blip in Q3 growing high-single digits in Q4 and for the full year. We've been capitalizing on the strength of our end-markets by continuing to reinvest in our people and our digital capabilities. About six months ago, we reorganized our IT, digital marketing, and Web design into a new support organization called Digital Solutions. This has put new emphasis and strategic significance around all things digital for the company. We hired a new world-class leader to run the organization and have embarked on a journey to view all digital information as mission critical to serving our customers. It has worked well. We've completed the Minneapolis phase of the ERP project, redesigned many of our websites including search engine optimization, and began projects such as single-order point processing for our products, no matter where they are produced, as well as consolidation of our many CRM tools. The idea is to better serve the customer with single-order shopping online and deploy a sales force that is trained to offer the whole catalog of Bio-Techne. Specialist maybe needed to close the deal, but we will reach the customer from a single point of contact and not from a group of disassociated reps from multiple divisions in the company. The U.S. commercial organization has now over 100 people. Five years ago, it was eight. Now, for some color on our Q4 performance by divisions. It was a fantastic year for our Biotech division which grew 11% organically in Q4 and finished the full year with 9% organic growth. Biotech's core products continue to perform very well with collective growth in the high-single digits for the year and accelerated 10% organic growth in Q4. The growth for the quarter and the year was broad across all major product lines including proteins, antibodies, and assays. We are now seeing the appearance of revolutionary new medicines that utilize living cells into therapeutic. These include cell therapies designed to target cancer. For example, recent FDA approval of the first CAR-T cell therapy as well as stem-cell based therapeutics. The manufacturer's cell-based treatment is complex and requires high-quality raw materials for cell culture. To meet demand in this exciting and rapidly expanding area, we offer the highest quality and the widest selection of GMP proteins including many exclusive to Bio-Techne, and large-scale manufacturing capability for bioprocessing. The recent acquisition of Quad Technologies and their unique system for immune cell activation adds to our rapidly growing portfolio. With regard to antibodies, we've been validating an extensive and growing number of antibodies using recent advances in gene-editing technology. The specificity and power of the CRISPR gene editing system is now being utilized by Bio-Techne for the validation of antibodies in knockout cell lines. This methodology is one of the proposed and currently most effective negative control identified by the International Working Group for Antibody Validation. Bio-Techne now has validated R&D Systems and Novus Biologics branded antibodies for over 110 different targets and a wide range of CRISPR knockout-modified cell lines and partnered with two gene-editing companies to produce biologically relevant data for nearly 1,000 antibody products. Bio-Techne gene knockouts are produced in over 10 different cell line models, all of which have been carefully selected to include those frequently used by scientists in their daily research, making these lines the most relevant in vitro model. Bio-Techne performs antibody validation for various applications using knockout cell lines, including Western blot, immunocytochemistry, and flow cytometry. Bio-Techne's knockout validation initiative meets the need for the life science research community for antibodies with enhanced specificity testing and is just one example of how we differentiate our antibodies to be a market leader. In assays, our recent success has in part been attributed to our commercial cross platform immunoassay workflow campaign. Bio-Techne has the broadest and highest quality assay platform to give our customers choice in selecting a solution they need. These include DuoSet that are used in basic research, our gold-standard single analyte ELISA kits that are used as the performance benchmark for all other assays and high-quality multiplex assays. SimplePlex are automated high sensitivity and reproducibility assay produced in conjunction with the Protein Platforms division is becoming a big success growing at 80% for this fiscal year. We saw a great success this year from our Luminex high-performance product offering with the launch of the Human XL Cytokine Discovery Luminex high-performance assay. This assay offers a broad choice of 45 analytes with superior accuracy when compared to other leading Luminex assay suppliers. Our customers who performed biomarker discovery and profiling will appreciate the flexibility of choosing only the analytes they need in our easy order option which will allow analyte selection online. Rounding up the Biotechnology segment, ACD finished the year with well over 30% Q4 growth in the research use only market, its current primary market, and over 30% for the full year overall. In addition to academic research, RNAscope and BaseScope assays are invaluable research tool for pharma and biotech companies. We wanted to make access to our technology even easier which is why ACD created an assay services offering some years back. This enables us to run and develop assays for our customers significantly reducing the discovery times and costs. We have listened to customer needs, expanding our tissue bank and creating regularly available datasets to enhance this offering further. Our goal is to facilitate drug discovery and development as much as possible by always being responsive to customer feedback and requests and by developing tools and services that really help to achieve research goals as quickly and as easily as possible. Today the assays services team is working on more than 100 custom projects per quarter. Following strong uptake in the research market, the focus in fiscal 2019 will be more rapid penetration of our RNAscope in the Diagnostics in markets that could be even bigger for ACD than research. Deepening our relationship with the key diagnostic instrument providers and expanding our Diagnostic offerings on the ACD platform will be key to our success in this market. Moving on to Protein Platforms which came roaring back in Q4 with nearly 20% organic growth in the quarter and the full year. This was tremendous growth, especially considering the very tough comp biologics faced this quarter as it did last quarter with 50% growth in the prior year. The accelerated growth last year was driven by customer replacements of old iCE280 instruments which were spurred by our discontinuing from future servicing of those systems in the second half of last year. Excluding customer placements, new customer placements of iCE instruments increased 25% in Q4 over the prior year. But the biggest story for Protein Platforms this year has been the Simple Western platform with well over 30% growth for the quarter and over 25% growth for the full year. With over 1,100 instrument (10:12) in the field and over 450 citations and publications, it appears that our automated Western blot platform has crossed the chasm from early adopters to more mainstream in our customers' workflows. Getting there has not been easy, our teams have put tremendous effort into marketing, demos, customer consultations to raise the awareness for ELISA's capabilities and efficiency. Just this past month, we announced an extension of our \u2013 of the Simple Western platform with a new instrument we call Jess. Jess builds on current Wes technology by using chemiluminescent detection which gives picogram-level sensitivity, enabling researchers to maximize the data they obtain from their samples. New fluorescent modes enable the detection of multiple wavelengths in the infrared and near-infrared spectrum, bringing definitive multiplexing capabilities to the Simple Western platform for the first time. Additional features include an in-capillary protein normalization reagent and a Western blot imaging system for traditional blotting membranes. Jess expands the applications that Simple Western technology can be used for and together with Wes, automates both the protein separation and immuno detection elements characteristic of traditional protein analysis techniques, eliminating many of the tedious, error-prone steps. With momentum we have with Wes and the market expansion opportunity we have with Jess, we are very excited about their prospects for the Simple Western platform as we head into fiscal 2019 and beyond. Next, moving onto Diagnostics division where timing of OEM orders resulted in a 2% decline of organic revenue in the fourth quarter and full-year organic revenue ended up 1%. This was a tough year for the division with large OEMs re-leveling their inventory needs as well as an industry trend towards continuous glucose monitoring, which is reducing the need for glucose controls. However, we did see strength in our hematology controls and point-of-care diagnostics kit and reagents manufacturing in fiscal 2018. We expect the strength of these product lines to continue in fiscal 2019 eventually overtaking the declines we have seen in glucose. In fact, the demand in these two key areas of our Diagnostic business have never been better as we will be expanding our facilities to accommodate the growth. Also, I would like to comment on our strong operational income and EPS performance in Q4. We outperformed our expectations for adjusted operating margin due to solid productivity from our teams and a more favorable mix of robust high-margin biotech product sales. Adjusted EPS reflects this strong operational performance that also includes continuing nice tailwinds from tax reform and foreign exchange. Finally, we announced in the fourth quarter and closed this past month on two very strategic deals. In the past, we have discussed our strategy of moving further into clinical markets expanding from research tools into diagnostics and therapeutic tools. With the purchases of Quad Technologies and Exosome Diagnostics, we have accomplished both. Cell-based immunotherapies continue to make progress as acceptable alternative therapies for challenging diseases where conventional first-line therapies have failed. This has created the need to find efficiencies in the manufacturing processes of these therapies, especially in the key steps of cell isolation and enrichment along with cell activation. Quad Technologies addresses both of these manufacturing steps by providing a biocompatible dissolvable polymer called QuickGel, which when functionalized with the correct antibodies can capture the cells of interest, primarily T-cells and then activate them for large scale expansion. The benefits of the QuickGel technology is the ability to manufacture them in sizes that mimic the size of accessory (13:34) cells associated with the normal-cell activation process, as well as the ability to dissolve them and reduce the risk of contaminating the final cell product to be infused into the patient. In the field of Diagnostics, liquid biopsy is an approach to bypass the traditional invasive tissue sampling conducted to confirm disease or assess disease progression. Three key targets have been used in liquid biopsy analysis, circulating tumor cells, cell-free DNA and exosomes. Exosome Diagnostics has pioneered the use of exosomes as a diagnostic tool because it offers a number of advantages. For one, exosomes are typically abundant in most bodily fluids unlike CTCs, and relatively easy to isolate during all stages of the disease. Second, the cell surface immunophenotypic properties of exosomes provide insights into their tissue of origin, unlike cell-free DNA. Also, the quality of the nucleic acids, exosomes contain is very good, unlike cell-free DNA typically exposed to circulating enzymes. Given these advantages, Exosome Diagnostics has developed and commercialized an exosome-derived diagnostic test, which is called EPI, that is based on the expression signature of three genes. The test results use gene expressions to determine whether men who have an ambiguous PSA score would benefit from having a prostate biopsy. The EPI test is a rule out test with a sensitivity of 92% that attempts to reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies done yearly, biopsies which can lead to serious complications for patients. This is an exciting and game-changing technology with 180 patents filed so far and more to come. Historically, we have been a company focused on research tools primarily in proteomics. The future is bright for us with our strong brand and science presence as we have moved closer to the clinician by diagnose and disease conditions (15:22) cancer with Exosome Diagnostics acquisition, SimplePlex platform, Luminex assays, and ACD with RNAscope as a technology platform. We are quickly becoming a company that can provide tools for cancer research, diagnosis, and therapeutics in the likes of CAR-T workflow. It's an exciting time for a company as the past 40 years of innovating over 40,000 products have positioned us to leverage the field of cytokines and growth factors, we pioneered as research tools to now becoming the tool for diagnosis and therapies, too. Fiscal 2018 was our best year in the past five and we have strong momentum going into fiscal year 2019. I feel very fortunate to be leading this wonderful team of now 2,100 strong worldwide. I want to thank all of them for the energy, passion and commitment to our company and the ongoing battle to rid the world of diseases. It's a wonderful endeavor. Jim and I will now turn the call over to you to provide more details on our financial performance for the quarter. James T. Hippel - Bio-Techne Corp.: Thanks, Chuck. I will provide an overview of our Q4 financial performance for the total company, and then provide some color on each of our three segments. Starting with the overall fourth quarter financial performance, adjusted EPS increased 23% to a $1.34. Our GAAP EPS for the quarter was a $1.07 compared to $0.74 in the prior year. Q4 reported revenue was $180.3 million, an increase of 15% year-over-year with organic revenue increasing 9%. Fourth quarter reported sales include a 4% growth contribution from acquisitions and a 2% contribution from favorable foreign exchange translation. Organic growth for the full fiscal year 2018 was 9%, the best full-year organic growth since this management team joined Bio-Techne. By geography, the U.S. grew in the low teens with BioPharma growth in the high-single digits and academia growing in the low teens. As in the U.S., Europe's organic growth continue to be strong in the low teens overall with the BioPharma end-market growing in the high-single digits and academia growing in the mid-teens. In Asia, China's organic growth was nearly 20% in the fourth quarter. Japan grew in the high teens and the rest of the Asia-Pacific region grew in the mid-teens. Note that all references made the growth rates by region and end-market exclude our OEM sales, which mostly occur in our Diagnostic segment and to a lesser extent in our Biotech segment. Moving on with the details of the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin was essentially flat for the prior year at 71.8% in Q4, with volume leverage negated by the mix from recent acquisitions. Adjusted SG&A in Q4 was 24.5% of revenue, approximately 20 basis points higher than the prior year. Strategic commercial investments to drive growth, the inclusion of recent acquisitions, and the impact of foreign exchange all contributed to the year-over-year increase in SG&A. R&D expense in Q4 was 7.8% of revenue, down 100 basis points from prior year due to volume leverage and timing of projects. The resulted adjusted operating margin for Q4 was 39.5%, an increase of approximately 80 basis points from the prior-year period. For GAAP reporting, SG&A in Q4 reflects an $11.2 million increase for stock option expense over the prior year. A new retirement policy was implemented in the fourth quarter that permits retirees to continue investing in certain time-based stock options granted during employment. This new policy resulted in accelerated stock compensation expense for those employees meeting the definition of retirement. Looking at our numbers below operating income, net interest expense in Q4 was $2.9 million compared to $1.8 million of net interest expense last year. The higher interest expense is driven by multiple rate increases in the past year on our outstanding line of credit. Other adjusted net operating expense for the quarter was $0.3 million, essentially the same as the prior-year quarter. For GAAP reporting, other non-operating includes a $16.1 million gain from a partial sale of our investment in ChemoCentryx. We monetized a little over one-third of this investment in the quarter to diversify our portfolio and raise cash funds for the pending acquisition that we made in July and early August. Our adjusted effective tax rate in Q3 was approximately 24.5%, nearly a 5-percentage point improvement from the prior year due to tax reform. For fiscal year 2019, we still expect this adjusted effective tax rate to stay consistent plus or minus 100 basis points. In terms of returning capital, we continue to pay our dividend and paid out $12 million in the quarter. Average diluted shares for the fourth quarter increased approximately 2% over the year-ago period at 38.3 million shares outstanding and a full-year increased approximately 1.5% at 38.1 million shares. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, $64.4 million of cash was generated from operations in the fourth quarter and our net investment in capital expenditures was $5.1 million. Excluding the acquisition earn-out payments which, for GAAP purposes, are deducted from operating cash flow, our adjusted cash flow from operations for the quarter was $64.8 million and $196.5 million for the total year. Both new records for the company. The management views these earn-outs as part of the purchase price paid for acquisitions. That's an investment rather than an operational cash expense. Both the Q4 and full-year adjusted operating cash flow demonstrates the strong quality of our earnings and management of net working capital. As for other notable items in our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $181.8 million of cash and short-term available for sale investment. Our long-term debt obligations at the end of Q4 stood at $339 million. That's down $53.5 million from the end of Q3. Going forward, our capital deployment priorities are debt pay down, opportunistic M&A, and paying our dividend. Now I'll discuss the performance of our three business segments, starting with the Biotechnology segment. Q4 reported sales were $115 million, with reported revenue increasing 18%. Acquisitions contributed 5% to revenue growth. Foreign exchange contributed 2% and organic growth was 11% with solid growth across all major product categories. For the full year, organic growth for the segment was 9%. Operating margin for the Biotech segment was 48.1% comparable to Q3 and a decrease of 100 basis points year-over-year due to unfavorable product mix. Core Biotech operating margin for the quarter was a very healthy 54% while operating margin contribution from ACD products was in the mid-teens compared to the low-single digits in the prior year. Turning to the Protein Platform segment, net sales in Q4 was $32.3 million, a total increase of 21% from the prior-year period. Organic growth for the segment was 19% with currency translation having a favorable impact of 2%. Double-digit growth continued in all major product categories which stand out this quarter being a Simple Western platform, which grew more than 30% and a SimplePlex platform which grew nearly 60%. For the full year, organic growth for the segment was 20%. Operating margins for the Protein Platform segment was 19.7%, an increase of 350 basis points from last year. Strong volume leverage and operational productivity drove a year-over-year improvement, partially offset by strategic growth investments made throughout the past year. Protein Platforms entered the full year with adjusted operating margin of 16.1%, an increase of 550 basis points over the prior year, a significant milestone as it continues to march towards even higher double-digit profitability. Moving on to our Diagnostic segment, reported revenue in Q4 was $33.1 million with reported growth of 2%. Organic revenue decreased 2% from the prior year, while acquisitions contributed 4%. As Chuck explained in his comments, the timing of OEM shipments was less favorable this quarter while the segment's more run rate-based hematology controlled product category experienced steady growth in the high-single digits. Full-year organic growth for this segment was 1%. At 32.2%, the Diagnostic segment operating margin was essentially flat for the prior year with favorable OEM mix offsetting lower variable volume contribution. The margin improvement was due to volume leverage and favorable OEM product mix. In summary, our breadth of growth continues to be solid both in terms of end-markets and product categories. Our operational profitability was in line with our expectations, even slightly ahead due to the stable mix of Biotech segment revenue growth this quarter and all year. And our very strong cash flow performance demonstrated the quality of our earnings. On the bottom line, tax reform was a real positive for Bio-Techne as it was for most U.S.-based companies. As we look to the year ahead, we expect our existing business to continue to execute through a strategic plan as it has in the past several years. For fiscal 2019, this means at least high-single-digit organic revenue growth. Executing this plan also means holding the strong operating margins we've maintained in our legacy core Biotech portfolio and Diagnostics division while rapidly expanding operating margins in our fast-growing ACD platform and Protein Platforms division. Depending on how the relative mix of our business turns out, adjusted operating margins for the legacy total company could be anywhere between flat to 100 basis points improvement in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018, with somewhere near the middle being the most likely scenario in our models currently. The two very strategic acquisitions that Chuck discussed and that we just completed this past month significantly bolstered the financials of our long-term strategic plan. The details of which we will share at our upcoming Investor Day this September 7 in New York City. Both of these companies just began commercialization of their products in January, and we believe are near their inflection point of rapid revenue growth. However, knowing when that precise inflection point will occur within the year is difficult to predict. Thus, the financial impact of this acquisitions, especially Exosome Diagnostics, will have on Bio-Techne's financial result for fiscal year 2019 could vary widely. Although, Exosome Diagnostics does have some revenue from companion diagnostic programs with pharma partners in clinical trials, the near-term ramp of revenue for the business will likely come from a wider adoption of their EPI prostate cancer test. The list price for this test is $795 and the Medicare approved price is $760. Actual realized price could be lower based on private payer contracts and claim collectability for certain patients. Exosome is currently processing over 1,000 tests per month in-spite of the pending NCCN endorsement and Medicare reimbursement decision. Although this volume has been generated from a sales force of only six people six months ago, their sales force is now over two dozen people and expected to grow to 60 people by the end of the year, positioning Exosome Diagnostics to capitalize on the increased demand that should come with NCCN endorsement filed by Medicare reimbursement. We expect both of these to occur in the first half of fiscal year 2019. And if it happens, we believe $30 million of revenue is achievable in the first year. We also expected at approximately 6,500 tests per month, Exosome Diagnostics will turn profitable. How quickly this will happen is difficult to determine, but we believe it could be by end of our fiscal year. In the meantime, we expect the acquisition of Exosome Diagnostics and Quad Technologies to unfavorably impact overall Bio-Techne adjusted operating margins by somewhere between 200 basis points and 400 basis points in fiscal year 2019. Our model showed continued rapid adoption of the EPI test beyond fiscal year 2019 with the business breaking even and even turning profitable in fiscal year 2020. However, the leaders of Exosome Diagnostics have signed up for a larger earn-out in calendar year 2020 that is tied to a very large profit number that same year. They're much more optimistic regarding the speed and magnitude of adoption of the EPI prostate cancer test. If there's a team that could execute in these earnout targets, it is this one. So, don't count them out. That concludes my prepared comments. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Rachel to open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Dan Arias with Citigroup. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, guys. Thank you. Maybe just to start on the outlook for the year. Chuck or Jim, can you just talk to the way that you're looking at segment performance to get to the high single-digit organic guide for the year? Should we still expect PPD to be in that 15% to 20% range? And then what are your expectations for ACD next year in order to get to the full year outlook? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Pretty much expected this to be the first question, yes. Yeah, we're actually very bullish still on PPD. There is a roaring comeback, which we said would probably be likely a bit of a blip in Biologic last quarter was insignificant after all. We had just stellar results this quarter, and we're just as bullish, if not more. The 15% or better is very highly likely. Meaning, we're tracking closer to 20% for the last year or more. So, we're hopeful we get that even. But 15% should be a safer number. ACD, we were ecstatic to really stay in (29:22) the core areas of 30%. A little bit of lumpiness in the Diagnostics side, but overall our thesis is coming near as we plan to be 30% or better for this next year and we're holding our line on that. I think the team is integrating a little harder in Europe than U.S. But it's coming along very well. We know we have new leadership overall on the segment with Kim Kelderman and that's helping as well. So, we're actually kind of \u2013 we're feeling pretty good about 30% for this coming year in ACD. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then maybe on the Exosome and Quad dilution for next year. It looks like 300 bps or so is probably where we should start to think about the impact for 2019, is that based on $30 million of revenue by the end of the year and just the ramp that you're assuming for commercial activity and then also just Medicaid, Medicare coverage, etcetera? I guess maybe just a little bit more color on what the assumptions are underneath the Op margin guide for the year. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Yeah. We've been preparing well for these questions and I understand the significance of this acquisition in going forward. We've been here before with other bigger acquisitions of \u2013 and we waited for these to kind of come in line and then hit that inflection point and take off. This one is no different. We are definitely near a nice inflection with this technology. I'll talk about NCCN guidelines in a minute, but the $30 million we think is very doable. Their forecasts are even much higher. We think it's in the range of being a strong possibility. They're ramping quickly. The 1,000 tests that Jim commented on was already a month or two ago and they're ramping higher than that now as they're bringing on more reps. It is very much \u2013 reps going after urology clinics and then getting the business. And with the guidelines coming with NCCN and getting NGS, which is Medicare, we would expect those rates will increase significantly at that point, which is pretty \u2013 we think is imminent. How to figure out where we're going to be on the burn rate, the cost of growing this entity, it's difficult. If they stay at the level they were in Q2, we're going to be out over $10 million and over that 200 basis points. If they stay on track with the ramping they're doing, it's going to be significantly under that. As Jim said, by the end of the year, we could be at a run rate of $50 million or $30 million for the year and be in positive territory for income. But it's anyone's guess right now as they're ramping. The good news is we're not waiting three years like we did with ProteinSimple. We're talking about a year here this thing hopefully skyrockets. And we've got a big earn-out with this team, and they've got a great team. We don't expect to lose any people. We have not. We're hiring quickly. And we're going to let them do their thing. They're the experts in this area. They're experts of the FDA and Medicare reimbursement. They know what they're doing. It's been a real pleasure having that team on board. We're going out next week to actually welcome them all, have our first business review, and kind of introduce them to the rigor that we do as operators in this company, and they're all excited for that, and the tools will help them with it. But it's in that 300-basis point probably, around that $30 million. And I think it could be better, but things could happen. So, I'm not too far off the guidance we gave you in terms of after the acquisition call. Nothing's changed since then. Actually, it's only improved. Information has all improved. And I will mention, as of this morning, we do have verbal acceptance from the NCCN that the second paper is going to be accepted and it's with the European Urology, which is a very important vehicle out there. So, we're hoping that off of that, once it gets in, including online and that will pave the way for the NGS decision, which is Medicare, which we think will be imminent. Of course, we can't tell you when. All I can tell you is that we do have news this morning is that the paper has been accepted. So, that's really great news for NCCN guidelines, and from here, it's hopefully going to be tracking as we stated. We gave guidance before end of the calendar year for all this. I'd be shocked if we can't make that at this point, but we'll see. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yeah. Okay. Thanks very much for that. Maybe just one more, quick one, and then I'll hop back in the queue. Jim the stock-based comp spike in the quarter, I guess, isn't really surprising, but could you just help us with the assumption for next year if we're looking to get a sense for Op margins that are inclusive of that expense? James T. Hippel - Bio-Techne Corp.: Yeah. It should come back down to a more normalized stock comp expense. Maybe a little bit higher year-over-year due to the fact we have more people onboard. We have Exosome personnel now included as well. But again, the spike we had in Q4 was kind of a onetime catch-up due to the folks that are at/or approaching retirement age and, therefore, the GAAP rules require us to accelerate that expense. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got it. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: And then going forward it will be lumpy. Q1 is where the hit will be every year so. James T. Hippel - Bio-Techne Corp.: Right. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : And next, we'll move on to Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners. Puneet Souda - Leerink Partners LLC : Yeah. Hi, Chuck and Jim. Congrats on the quarter. First, on PPD and Simple Western, I mean you've had the Simple Western product for some time. And obviously, as you pointed out, this has gone mainstream. Maybe, first, could you give us a view of how much of this was academic versus BioPharma this time and sort of how should we think about Simple Western and the growth of the new hybrid products that just came out sort of longer term? James T. Hippel - Bio-Techne Corp.: Well, okay. So first off, it's been around for three years now and it's taken some time to get accepted, and we've talked a lot about it in the past. It is such a big change from doing them by hand that it has to be sold into a different laboratory. Our goal is to still make it a standard and to make it the way students started doing Westerns in the future eventually, and no different than moving to calculators was 30 years ago. That's our goal. I think it's a balanced level of growth between academia and pharma. The growth is strong in both categories. We had \u2013 I'm not going to tell you the number of instruments we had \u2013 we sold, it was a record number. It was fantastic. It puts us well over 1,100 total in the field and the publications are actually growing even at a faster clip ever as well. So, we know we are crossing that chasm. They're becoming broad-based acceptance quite simply because it works and it saves a ton of time. It's very productive, and we're now going to be able to go a little more upstream with Jess and with more capability of doing our multiplexing samples at the same time which is something we've been asking for forever. And then that gives us more flexibility with Wes probably at the academic level, clearly having the ability to promote that further to get more acceptance in smaller labs, smaller universities with budgets maybe tighter. So, I will also state that the consumables growth has been astounding. We are well on track to a combined consumables and service to being north of 50% of the revenue. So, the attach rate of cartridges has been really, really good. That means that people aren't just using these things thinking they'll get around to them and figure out how to use them. They're using them and they're using a lot and they're liking what they see. Puneet Souda - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. Thanks for that. And another one on \u2013 let me touch on China if I could. Obviously, a strong growth as some of the peers have reported to a similar growth numbers. Helps us just understand. I mean, how are you looking at tariffs and any potential impact there in fiscal year 2019? James T. Hippel - Bio-Techne Corp.: Yeah. Well, currently, there's almost no impact. We're at less than a 1% level, and that's because most of our products aren't in these chemicals classifications. But if the $200 billion plus next Phase goes into effect, we're going to be hit on many fronts like everybody else. All the instruments for sure and many of our assays will also be implicated. What's the impact going to be, I think it's mixed. We'll do it product line by product line. Obviously, a lot of our products were \u2013 we're the only game in town and so we'll be passing on the prices, obviously. But where there is local competition and there probably is some antibodies area (37:51) for sure, there will be some that could be a different story. But I think the mix will be okay. We're still not overly concerned. Our teams aren't too concerned. We're just aware of it and starting to get ready just in case. And we can do something, moving something directly from the UK that are made there and also from Canada. So, there's some things we can do. But for the most part, most of our reagents and our products come out of the U.S. so there could be an impact if the Phase 2 and 3 $200 billion-plus plans go into place, which it's anyone's guess whether they will or not. Puneet Souda - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. Thanks. Last one on Exosome, I was hoping if you could elaborate on your approach to commercial payers after Medicare here? Do you think you can hold this price, sort of longer term to help us just understand the strategy you're taking with commercials? James T. Hippel - Bio-Techne Corp.: Well, all I can go with historical data. I mean, we did all these original models that are $500 million number and we were all ecstatic when the CMS came out with a $760 million price, that gives us lots of room. We're pretty much sure we can hold over $600 million, but I think $700 million initially, it's going to be in that range. They're getting the number where they are getting paid, it's coming in where it needs to be. But it's always very different payer groups come in and they do their contracts, it's probably move around a little bit. But definitely north of $500 million, but hopefully closer to $700 million. Puneet Souda - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. All right. Thank you. James T. Hippel - Bio-Techne Corp.: And one final comment, too, is that, we \u2013 the Blue Cross Blue Shield network is a big proponent and supporter and early supporter and adopter of this technology. So, we expect them to be really compliant with all that pricing as well. So, they've been really good to work with, and we're hoping that they \u2013 eventually this becomes more of a mandated screening. And so, that's the idea. But it's going to be out there a ways. Operator : And next we move to Catherine Schulte with Baird. Catherine Ramsey Schulte - Robert W. Baird & Co.: Hey, guys, congrats on a really nice quarter, and thanks for the questions. Obviously, a nice return to double-digit growth on the Protein Platforms segment. Can you just talk us through your outlook on the competitive environment in that business on the Biologics side, and any specific changes you made during the quarter to get back on that strong trajectory? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Well, I can say is the stories of the Biologics' demise have greatly exaggerated last quarter. We don't have an awful lot of competition in this category. In the Simple Western, we have virtually none. And now we see SimplePlex becoming more material, and if it continues growing at 60%, it's going to have a bigger overall basis. And single-cell is finally starting to take off. It's taken a while to get that going. These chasm, I guess, are deep, and some of these moves the world instruments. So, we're feeling pretty bullish. I will mention also that we have a big project in place with the Biologics platform to get it working under Empower. Empower (40:59) is one of the standards out there, used now in most laboratories, and without that, that definitely probably costs us some sales. But even now just being able to talk about that we're in the middle of integrating that system, and we'll have that commercialized within the next year or so, that's helping with a lot of decisions going forward with funding to go with this platform or expand in this platform beyond iCE. So, all good. I think of all our numbers, we've been steady around 15% or better is probably one of the safest ones I think we have right now, so. Catherine Ramsey Schulte - Robert W. Baird & Co.: All right. Great. And then, appreciate the color on Exosome, but can you walk us through what your assumptions are for Quad in terms of revenue contribution next year, and then what that long-term margin outlook looks like? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Yeah. Jim and I talked about this that might come up. It's so small really compared to Exosome that we didn't want to bring it the too much rhetoric in the transcript for, but it's a great platform for us because we have all these cytokines kinds of resellers tools. We're involved in all of this CAR-T type workflow already. So, we really want to get bigger in this \u2013 on the tool side of it \u2013 tools for therapy. And this QuickGel technology is in the midst of three very large clinicals \u2013 large pharma companies right now and it's being looked at and qualified by at least a half a dozen others. It is going to be a wonderful platform. This year, most of the revenue is really around just revenue for the clinicals. So, it's not much this year. But it expands greatly \u2013 virtually explodes next year and the year after, everybody, if these clinicals all hit. So, we'll give more guidance as we get beyond $1 million in revenue and become something. But, again, this tool is only a year away from nearly being in a profitable state, maybe even less. It's a small team who is actually doing some of the work here as well because there's a lot of good synergy science-wise with our teams in Core Biotech, so it's good that way. The team has all come onboard. The founder-leader is onboard as the leader of this small business unit right now and loving it. And it's so far, so good. I got to mention to you one thing about that both of these platforms that \u2013 they need salespeople. And ever since the acquisition has been announced, the phones have been ringing off the hook. It appears that a lot of great salespeople like to come onboard once they know that you can make payroll, so. Catherine Ramsey Schulte - Robert W. Baird & Co.: All right then. And last one for me just on Exosome. How should we be thinking about the revenue trajectory over the next several years? Where do you view peak margins, and what level of revenue will it take to reach those steady state margins? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Well. It's an LDT, right. So, we have to feed it and we have to build, we have to build regionally, we have to build and shift, and that's the model. We're capable right now of actually doing as many as 500 tests a day. Obviously, we're well under that. So, we're good for a while. We have world-class operations. People are ready to really ramp this up. We have world-class reimbursement people online with ExosomeDx. I mean, this team has been at this for a while and they've really done their homework. And they've been around a while, right. So, they seem to know what they're doing. The $30 million this year is our number. And it's \u2013 I would say on the north side of conservative really. We think it's a range of $20 million to $35 million probably. And I'd be really happy with $20 million or better, to be honest, coming from nothing in January. But the ramp from next year on, they are big numbers. We'll give you more color on that in New York. Right now, we're still trying to figure out what we're going to even say because they are too big. They're big. James T. Hippel - Bio-Techne Corp.: And, Catherine, what I will just add is the agreement with Exosome Diagnostics is public information. It's out there on our website. And detail to the earn-outs are out there as well, and you can see the earnouts are based off of operating profit numbers or EBITDA numbers both in calendar year 2020 and calendar year 2022. And they are very big numbers, which gives you a sense of what the Exosome Diagnostics teams and internal expectations on what they think they could hit. So, we're downplaying that a bit, just to be conservative. But that's what really the potential is. And that would suggest, a very, very large revenue, a couple of hundred million dollars or more, just in as little two to three years. And then operating margins that are at least 30% and higher. So, that's what they think they can do. We're being somewhat conservative in our viewpoint in terms of valuation, but that's what the potential is. We've learned through ProteinSimple and others, so we're not going to get ahead of our skis too soon, but it's a good story so far. And the ramp is happening, so we're very happy to see the growth happening. Catherine Ramsey Schulte - Robert W. Baird & Co.: Great. Thank you. James T. Hippel - Bio-Techne Corp.: And this was all without Medicare yet. So, get ready. Operator : And next we move to Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. First question, can you talk about the sustainability or the strength you're seeing in Europe? James T. Hippel - Bio-Techne Corp.: I'm sorry. Could you say it again? Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Yeah. Can you talk about the sustainability of the strengths you're seeing in Europe and maybe what you're doing to try to support that? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Yeah. We're letting them hire a lot more people than we originally thought. They're growth has been astounding. We've brought in a great leader that ran health care for 3M. We put in place a subsidiary model. We put in place what we call EOCs, it's an operating committee from all the regions. So, we have a matrix in place with the divisions running \u2013 who run the global P&Ls from here, and it's just working. That scenario allows synergies being created for selling. So, the divisions can work together, the teams work together. It's all under a unique kind of management style that just wasn't there a year before. We just had nothing. So, call it a catch up. I mean, how long will it go? I think another year or two or at least until geopolitical events in Europe change greatly or Brexit becomes a real truly negative reality or something, but it's been double-digit, and I don't see it stopping in the next few quarters anyway. Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then just a clean-up question for the model, did you give the organic growth rate for ACD in Q4? I might have missed it. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Oh, we didn't give it in total. We mentioned that the research-use-only market, which is the primary market for that business right now, was over 30% growth for the quarter. Their companion diagnostic piece, which is much smaller but much more lumpier, was up and down, and service business, but the core part of that business right now, which is their products in the research space was up over 30%. James T. Hippel - Bio-Techne Corp.: To be transparent, Dan, they have a service component that was \u2013 it's very lumpy, and they had a huge comp from a year ago. When you put that all in there, it's under 30% for the whole company. But it's kind of a one-time blip there. As long as RNAscope and what it's being used for growing at 30%-plus, that's kind of what we focus on. It was actually like 36%, and we had a really strong launch to this quarter. July is really strong as well. So, to the question earlier, that's the big question. Can we stay above 30% with this business unit, and we think we can. Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Appreciate the clarification. Thank you. Operator : And next we'll move to Amanda Murphy with William Blair. Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thanks. I actually just had a follow-up to the question that Puneet was asking around private payers for Exosome. So just curious, is there \u2013 I guess I'm just trying to get a sense of what if anything you guys need to do to \u2013 is there any more data that you need to build up in order to move forward with the private payer side? James T. Hippel - Bio-Techne Corp.: To be honest, we're trying to learn this ourselves. Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC: Right. James T. Hippel - Bio-Techne Corp.: We're \u2013 as you know, as a company core \u2013 we're not reimbursement experts. We've been a tools company, and we're going this direction. They're helping us. We'll be out there next week and learn more. And I hear numbers from them to be anywhere from 100 to 200 heads covered, and there are different metrics and algorithms people use, and I think it's all baloney. So, I think we have tens of millions of people on the East Coast covered through Blue Cross Blue Shield. The deals are in place. We've hit roughly 30% of the market are these urology centers, these labs, and that's where the salespeople are focused and that's been where the great take-up is. And that will lead to more leverage. So we're going to be trying to put together for New York just exactly what is the addressable market, being all these payers, being the urology centers, etcetera. Certainly, right now, it's more than we can handle and we need the NCCN guidelines in place so that there'll be even more conformance through the major payers, right, the systems out there. There's quite a bit acceptance, even people through the urology centers themselves, even people on their own that it works so well. But we need Medicare, we need the NGS decision, and then we'll start seeing the major payer systems lining up, and then we'll have more metrics off of that. Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC: And just to be clear the $30 million that you were talking about, that assumes that you've got Medicare coverage, is that right? James T. Hippel - Bio-Techne Corp.: That assumes, yes. Before and by end of this calendar year this year, which we think as of news this morning, we feel very good about that now. Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yes. Okay. James T. Hippel - Bio-Techne Corp.: Never can tell though. Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yeah. All right. And I had a question on the kind of legacy business, antibodies and ELISA. It feels like for a few quarters now, those businesses have been pretty strong. I know like at one point, there was some price competition there when you first started. I was just was curious if you could give us an update on what you're seeing from a competitive standpoint in two cases (51:16)? James T. Hippel - Bio-Techne Corp.: I'm really glad you asked this or somebody did because this is the best stories of this quarter and this year. I mean if you'd asked me four years ago, how long is it going to take you to get to 10% organic growth again in your core? I'd have said, well probably never. So, we've had not only a good quarter, we had a great year. And we just pounded it. And that's why, one reason you see, it's kind of, I would say ahead of schedule getting back to 40% Op margins, because the mix has been so good with the core, which is highly profitable, right. 54% Op margins in Core Biotech division, that's the number it was when I came into the company. So, we've just been doing all the expansion and having the productivity to cover it, it's been great. And it's across all lines. I've done the math myself this morning while ELISA is low-single-digit growth, at least it's growth. When \u2013 and because of ELISA's depicted demise a decade ago, we started looking at different technology platforms, Luminex and SimplePlex and such, they're all doing great. You put together the entire number for this quarter for our, call it, assays and we're mid-teens, practically, just under mid-teens for growth. So, that was one of the biggest areas we were trying to protect. Proteins as always, we thought, will stay just under mid-single digit and we've been nearly high-single-digit growth. I think all this oncology, all this CAR-T, all this research in the biosimilar in fact (52:43), it's spurring a lot of protein and we've had great pricing along with it. And that's also something to mention, that five years ago, we weren't a company focused on dealing with price ever. And now we have the analytics in place to deal with price and we have some price in place where it needs to be, where we have the ability to do so. And lastly, antibodies, it's been a little bit lumpier this year than the year before, but ended strong. And we're really excited about what we see with antibodies. We still think we're holding our own, if not taking share. We're not digging the rabbit monoclonal, of course, but everything outside of that we're right up there. I would also say that the drive from BigPharma to CROs and the whole CAR-T all the stuff happening, it's helping the antibody business. But it's helping in a way where the big guys are going to win. The little mom and pop antibodies players are not going to win as well right now because you need to be GMP, you need to have high quality to be in these areas now. And that's going to help us and Thermo, and Abcam the most probably. And that's what we see. And I think that's why we're doing so well. Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : And next we'll move to Matt Hewitt with Craig-Hallum Capital Group. Matthew G. Hewitt - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC : Good morning, gentlemen. A couple, I guess, bigger picture questions. Regarding the investment that you're making into India. How quickly do you anticipate that market ramping up and what should we be thinking about that over the next couple of years? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Yeah. We do nearly $4 million of revenue in India right now and it's growing. Our plan is to try and keep that north of 50% growth. And personally, I like it bigger. But my regional heads says there's only so much you can do so fast. So, we're hiring people and you're really dealing with two maybe three of the major city areas right. That's how you deal with India and you know the customers is there they \u2013 the infrastructure is not good for \u2013 the customers all clustered into life science center sort of space. So that's a good thing. You can get to all of them at one place kind of. So, you don't need a lot of head count. So, we're moving with four people, I would say two years from now, we'll have maybe a dozen, it would be my guess and I assure, I hope for between $10 million and $20 million of revenue by then, we'll see. But it depends. And that's about any really infusion of ACD at or our Exosome. So, all those things could also add some impact. But in the core, it's growing nicely, but it only has so much of an addressable market size right now. Instruments probably had the better possibilities in the short term. Matthew G. Hewitt - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC : Okay. Great. And then one follow-up question here. Thinking back five years ago, you came onboard. You kind of laid out a roadmap, targets of getting the company to double-digit revenue growth, at the time, at the expense of margins, but you had intimated over time you expected those to bounce back. And not to steal any thunder from the New York day coming up. But as you look out over the next five years, how do you think \u2013 what are your targets? And I know that you laid them out last year, but maybe an update on your call it five-year plan? Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Yeah. I'll give you a little bit of a preview. So, come this fall with the first strategic call we had, we laid our first strategic plan, and I laid out there the vision to get to $1 billion in 5 years. So, we didn't make that, okay? Two years ago this fall, we had our first Investors Conference, and we laid out a plan that would get us to $850 million and 40%, all right? We're well on track for that, probably exceeding it. But this fall, we'll lay out a new five-year outlook. We'll give you the update on what we are doing in for last, and we'll give you a new outlook as well including how the \u2013 if the stars align slide, and you see what happens. The last time we showed that slide two years ago, we had a $1.3 billion number on there with the acquisitions, everything in, using capital at a modest decent leverage level. I think we're on track with that recipe, and we'll see what Jim comes up with the new slide. He hasn't made it yet. So, I'm assuming it'll be bigger than $1.3 billion. I hope so. My goal right now is still to \u2013 counting the core things we have, how fast can we get to $1 billion and can we get to the 40% or not. Probably, you're going to see a number lower than the 40% now with these new high growth, high volume park areas. We see a 30% Op margin future with ExosomeDx, not 40% at this point. So \u2013 but we'll see. It's early. We don't really know yet where the leverages and synergies could be. So, that's we're on track with that. So, that's as much as we can give you. All I can say is don't miss New York. It should be a good meeting. Matthew G. Hewitt - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC : That's great. Thank you very much. Operator : And at this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Kummeth for any additional or closing remarks. Charles R. Kummeth - Bio-Techne Corp.: Well, we've run an entire hour. That's first time ever, I think. So, I'm really happy about that. Thank you, all, for attending and look forward to speaking to you again next quarter. Thank you. Operator : And that will conclude today's call. We thank you for your participation.",

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the call will be opened for questions following the management's prepared remarks.  I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Hippel. Please go ahead - Jim Hippel, Bio-Techne Chief Financial Officer. Sorry about that. Please go ahead. Jim Hippel : No worries. Thank you. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. On the call with me this morning is Chuck Kummeth, Chief Executive Officer of Bio-Techne. Before we begin, let me briefly cover our Safe Harbor statement. Some of the comments made during this conference call may be considered forward-looking statements, including beliefs and expectations about the company's future results. The company's 10-K for fiscal year 2018 identifies certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements made during this call. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of any new information or future events or developments. The 10-K as well as the company's other SEC filings are available on the company's website within its Investor Relations section. During the call, non-GAAP financial measures may be used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. Tables reconciling these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available in the company's press release issued earlier this morning on the Bio-Techne Corporation website at www.bio-techne.com. Before I turn the call over to Chuck, I'd like to remind everyone about our changes in segment reporting for fiscal year 2019 beginning in Q1. We have moved from three segments as reported in prior years to two. These two new segments are our Protein Sciences segment and our Diagnostics and Genomics segment. Our Protein Sciences segment consists of the legacy Protein Platform segment in addition to the legacy Biotechnology segment less legacy Advanced Cell Diagnostics, or ACD. The Diagnostics and Genomics segment consists of the legacy Diagnostics segments in addition to legacy ACD, which we now refer to as the Genomics division. Our most recent acquisition, Exosome Diagnostics, will also be included in the Diagnostic and Genomics segment.  With that reminder, I will now turn the call over to Chuck. Chuck Kummeth : Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter conference call.  I am very pleased to report that we started the year at fiscal year 2019 much how we ended fiscal 2018 on a strong note and in line with our strategic plan. The company delivered 10% organic growth in the quarter led by our Protein Sciences segment with a stellar 14% organic growth. The growth in this segment was very broad in almost every product category in geographic region. The Diagnostics and Genomics segment was weighed down by timing of OEM shipments in Q1 but this was not a surprise to us and we expect the timing to be more favorable the remainder of the year contributing to overall organic growth going forward. This was also an exciting quarter for us on the M&A front where we completed two acquisitions, Quad Technologies and Exosome Diagnostics, to provide new technologies and give the company and its legacy portfolio access to new and fast-growing end markets. In a quarter when most of our major geographies produced outstanding results, it\u2019s hard to call out a favorite, but I will. Europe once again reported double-digit organic growth. While most of our regions reported double-digit growth, what makes this special to me is the consistency of growth we have seen from our European team, averaging double-digit growth there for the last two years. The unified selling model that combines reagents with instruments to sell full solutions to our academic and biopharma customers is most developed in Europe, and it is definitely working. We began to expand this solution-based selling model to the U.S. in calendar year 2018, and we are starting to see similar results with solid double-digit growth here as well in Q1. The academic end markets are performing particularly well with focused solution-based campaigns geared toward these customers coupled with a favorable NIH funding backdrop. As in the U.S. and Europe, China also delivered great results in Q1. Growth in this region was up over 30% with our instrument and genomics portfolio leading the way. The war on tariffs between U.S. and China has had minimal impact in our growth in China, and we don\u2019t expect that to change. China\u2019s five-year plan calls for massive investment and life sciences research, and there are not a lot of China domestic alternatives to the products we offer their researchers. Also, as a reminder, we do not source any products or materials out of China for U.S. customers. Within the Protein Sciences segment, we experienced growth in every single major product category and double-digit growth in most. Our instruments-based solutions continue to receive great acceptance in the market with our automated Western blot solutions growing over 30% in Q1 led by our newly released instrument Jess, and our automated ELISA solution, Ella, growing nearly 70%, and we believe there is still plenty of room to grow from here. For example, diagnostic decisions are increasingly being driven by cytokine and growth-factor-related profiles in circulating body fluids. This creates a need for a testing platform like our SimplePlex that can accommodate more complex biomarker signatures. This past month, Bio-Techne entered into a strategic co-operation agreement with Micropoint Bioscience of Shenzhen, China. Micropoint Bioscience has developed a microfluidic diagnostic chip for point-of-care testing that could help revolutionize healthcare in China by accelerating the speed of diagnosis and giving medical providers the ability to test and treat individuals who do not have access to a healthcare facility. The microfluidic diagnostic chip from Micropoint Bioscience will advance point-of-care testing by shrinking tests so that only minimal volumes of samples and reagents are required. Working together, Micropoint Bioscience will integrate our microfluidic technology to develop better and more accurate point of care diagnostic tools for precision medicine in China. The first product will focus on patient monitoring for situations like autoimmune disease and cytokine storm. The potential for our SimplePlex technology used in this application is huge a few years from now, and this is just one example of many potential diagnostic applications for this platform. Growth in the Protein Sciences segment also benefited from continued strength in our core reagents, especially in cell and gene therapy applications. Bio-Techne\u2019s solutions for the cell therapy workflow span across our portfolio. These include GMP grade cytokines and growth factors, high quality antibodies for flow cytometry and immunocytochemical characterization, gold standard immunoassays, next generation automated immunoassay platforms, DNA and RNA in-situ hybridization assays, GMV-grade small molecules and more. Through strategic acquisitions like Quad Technologies last quarter and internal scientific innovation, Bio-Techne has become uniquely positioned to provide a broad innovative and flexible set of reagents and instrumentation across the cell and gene therapy workflow. In 2019, Bio-Techne will bring its multi-brand solutions together with the mission of providing pioneering cell and gene therapy solutions from discovery to the clinic. This cell therapy initiative will unite these reagents, provide the cell therapy community with a rich and user-friendly resource for reagents, instrumentation, and scientific expertise across the cell therapy workflow. The goals of our cell and gene therapy initiative are twofold.  First, we\u2019ll provide and develop innovative solutions designed to simplify the workflow for both immune cell and stem cell-based therapies, such as Cloud\u2019s branded cell activation kits and SimplePlex assays. Second, we aim to make the transition from the bench to the bedside easier by providing progressive solutions that can be stepped through the journey from discovery to cell therapy manufacturing. Thus, this initiative will not only provide immediate workflow solutions, it will also facilitate development of new and innovative technologies to address the current and future manufacturing needs of the cell therapy community. Moving on to our Diagnostics and Genomics segment, where timing of OEM orders overshadow the underlying strength in its end markets. Based on a scheduling of OEM orders for the remainder of 2018 and into 2019, we knew at the end of last quarter that Q1 was going to be the most challenging year over year revenue comp for the segment, but the OEM deal pipeline for the remainder of this year and beyond is still healthy, especially as it pertains to hematology controls and diagnostics reagents/kits. Also, the Genomics business, formerly ACD, is still humming along at double-digit growth, especially in the RUO market where growth was nearly 30% in Q1. But the big story in this segment is our acquisition of Exosome Diagnostics, which closed August 1. As a reminder, Exosome Diagnostics has pioneered the use of exosomes as a diagnostics tool to detect numerous cancers and neurological conditions from samples of urine, blood or other bodily fluids, thus reducing the need for certain invasive biopsies. Its first commercialized liquid biopsy diagnostic test, which is called EPI, determines whether men who have an ambiguous PSA score between 2 and 10 would benefit from having a prostate biopsy. The EPI test is a rule-out test with a sensitivity of 92% that attempts to reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies done yearly, biopsies which can lead to serious complications for patients.  This week will mark the third month since Exosome Diagnostics has been part of the Bio-Techne family. During this time, integration activities have been ongoing to ensure that they have the infrastructure, compliance measures and commercial resources necessary to support the ramp in volume we expect over the course of the next year and beyond. Urologists in the field have shown great enthusiasm for EPI. In the quarter ended September 30, including the month of July under prior ownership, nearly 3,000 tests were processed and this is from a sales force that averaged 14 people. This compares to roughly 1,500 tests processed in the quarter ended March 31, when the sales force averaged just seven people.  So since the acquisition date, we have more than doubled the investment in commercial headcount to 32 sales reps. So this gives you a sense of the ramp and test we expect to see within the next six months. We also expect the productivity per rep to continue to improve as our marketing campaigns increase visibility of EPI to the urology community and reimbursement by both private and public payers propagates.  Speaking of reimbursement, the Exosome team to date has contracted with nearly 20 private, commercial and PPO networks nation-wide and they have Medicaid enrolled in nearly 20 states. Going forward, the team has an aggressive pipeline and timeline to continually expand the coverage of both private and public payers. Of course, the biggest payer of all given the demographics of those most likely to take the EPI test is Medicare.  We don't know when EPI will be approved for reimbursement but we have high confidence that it will be approved. What gives us such confidence? Well, the lab coverage decision finalized on October 10 clearly aligns coverage with NCCN guidelines and provides a format to easily add EPI once it's included in those guidelines. So when we will see EPI included in the NCCN guidelines? Well, we expect to see the revised NCCN guidelines for 2018 by no later than December 31, since after that date, they no longer will be 2018 guidelines but will instead will have skipped a year and go on straight to 2019. Usually, the guidelines are published by September, so they\u2019re already later than normal and hopefully won\u2019t go all the way until the very end of the year to release. What gives us confidence that EPI will be included in the NCCN guidelines? Well, the board overseeing the urology in the NCCN guidelines has advised us that a second prospective U.S. clinical validation of the EPI test by a high-impact peer-reviewed urology journal was needed to garner their approval into the guidelines. That validation occurred on September 18 in the European Urology Journal, which published data confirming the findings of the first U.S. prospective validation study presented in JAMA Oncology in 2016. The publication also disclosed the consensus reached by the studies principle investigators on a care path integrating EPI into the decision about proceeding with an initial prostate biopsy. So now what? We wait, and hopefully for not much longer. Our team has completed all the steps and checked all the process factors we believe are required for approval. Also, sufficient external validation has been published. The decision and the timing of the decision is now in the hands of the NCCN committee and Medicare, but in the meantime, we are ramping our commercial resources to make EPI available to as many patients as possible and as quickly as possible. Finally, before I turn the call over to Jim, who will give more details on our financial performance, I would like to comment on our adjusted operating margin performance in Q1. While we did indeed experience 140 basis point year-over-year headwind to adjusting operating margin due to the acquisitions we have made over the past year, especially Exosome Diagnostics, I am very pleased to report that excluding these acquisitions, our adjusted operating margins grew 200 basis points year over year in Q1. I believe this demonstrates our commitment to holding our historically strong core margins while ramping profitably in the businesses we have acquired over the past five years. Overall, the first quarter was a great start to what I believe will be a great year among many more ahead as we proceed on executing to our strategy plan. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jim. Jim Hippel : Thanks, Chuck. I will provide an overview of our Q1 financial performance for the total company, as well as provide some color on each of our segments. Starting with the overall first quarter financial performance, adjusted EPS increased 9% to $0.98, while GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.45 compared to $0.42 in the prior year. Q1 reported revenue was $163 million, an increase of 13% year over year, with organic revenue increasing 10%. First quarter reported sales includes a 4% growth contribution from acquisitions and a 1% unstable impact from foreign exchange translation. By geography, the U.S. grew in the teens, Europe\u2019s organic growth was in the mid-teens, while China grew over 30%. By end-market, BioPharma growth was in the high single digits, while Academia sales growth was in the high teens. Note that all references made to growth rates by region and end-market exclude our OEM sales, which mostly occur in our Diagnostic and Genomics segment and to a lesser extent, in our Protein Sciences segment. Moving on to the details of the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin was essentially flat the prior year at 72% in Q1 while volume leverage and operational productivity negated by the mix from recent acquisitions. Adjusted SG&A in Q1 was 29.1% of revenue, a 170 basis points higher than the prior year where volume leverage was more than offset by the additional SG&A added as a result of acquisition. R&D expense in Q1 was 9.1% of revenue, down 30 basis points from prior year to the volume leverage and timing of projects. The resulting adjusted operating margin for Q1 was 33.9%, a decrease of 140 basis points in the prior-year period. However, as Chuck already mentioned, excluding the impact from recent acquisitions, core adjusted operating margins expanded 200 basis points year-over-year. This was driven by strong volume leverage, favorable product mix and solid operational productivity. For GAAP reporting, SG&A in Q1 reflects a 7.8 million increase for stock option expense over the prior year. As you may recall, a new retirement policy was implemented in the fourth quarter at fiscal year 2018 that permits retirees to continue investing in certain time-based stock option grants during employment.  This new policy resulted in an accelerated stock compensation expense for those employees mean the definition of retirement back in Q4. For those same employees who receive their stock option awards during the annual Q1 grant period, the entire grant award was expensed in the current quarter. This results in a year-over-year timing difference that were largely reversed when we get to the fourth quarter of this year. Looking at our numbers below operating income, net interest expense in Q1 was $5 million compared to $2.1 million of net interest expense last year. The higher interest expense is driven by a higher debt levels that resulted from our acquisition of Exosome Diagnostics as well as multiple LIBOR rate increases in the past year on our outstanding line of credit. Our bank debt on the balance sheet as of the end of the Q1 stood at $551.5 million, up from $339 million at the end of Q4. Other adjusted non-operating expense for the quarter was $0.8 million, essentially the same as the prior-year quarter. For GAAP reporting, other non-operating includes a $2.2 million unrealized loss from our investment in ChemoCentryx. This is due to the adoption of accounting standards update 2016-1 recognition in measurement of financial assets and financial liability which requires equity investments with readily available fair market values to report as an asset in the balance sheet and then any changes in fair market value be recorded on the income statement. The prior standard required changes in fair market value recorded in the equity section of the balance sheet. Moving on down the P&L, our adjusted effective tax rate in Q1 was 22.5%, nearly a 7 percentage point improvement from the prior year due to tax reform. For fiscal year 2019 we expect this adjusted effective tax rate to stay consistent to Q1, plus or minus 100 basis points. Turning to cash flow and return of capital, $38.6 million of cash was generated from operations in the first quarter, and our net investment and capital expenditures was $4.3 million. $12.1 million of dividends were paid out in the quarter and average diluted shares stood at 38.8 million shares outstanding. Now I\u2019ll discuss the performance of our reporting segments, starting with the protein sciences segment. Q1 reported sales were $126.4 million, with reported revenue increasing 17%. Organic growth was 14% with acquisitions contributing 4% to revenue growth and foreign exchange unfavorably impacting growth by 1%. As Chuck has already described, the growth in this segment was very broad in almost every product category and geographic region. Operating margin for the protein sciences segment was 43.2%, an increase of 50 basis points year over year due to strong volume leverage and operational productivity, partially offset by the mix of lower margin acquisitions. I\u2019d like to reiterate Chuck's earlier comment regarding our commitment to improving the profitability from our acquisitions. As an example, this quarter, our ProteinSimple branded products achieved a new profitability record with well over 20% operating margin. That is approximately 900 basis points greater than the prior year. Turning to the Diagnostics and Genomics segment. Q1 reported sales were $36.7 million, relatively flat to the prior year. Organically, revenues declined 2% due to unfavorable timing of diagnostic OEM shipments, partially offset by double-digit growth in our Genomics businesses. Acquisitions contributed 2% to revenue, including those from EUROCELL and Exosome Diagnostics. Chuck has provided commentary on the test ramp of EPI. Here, I will provide some additional color on revenue and revenue recognition as it pertains to EPI. Exosome Diagnostics has been recognizing EPI revenue on a cash basis. This is the correct accounting treatment given its recent commercial launch in 2018.  For patients insured by private payers, the cycle from test report date to payment can be as long as 90 days. For patients insured by Medicare, billing has been put on hold until a decision had been made by Medicare on reimbursement. With Medicare approval still pending and given we only owned Exosome for the last two months of Q1, very little of the tests performed during these two months were collected before the end of September. Thus, minimal revenue from EPI was recorded in our Q1 results. Furthermore, cash collections on tests performed before the August 1 acquisition date are not recorded as revenue, but rather accounted for on the balance sheet under purchase accounting. In order to record revenue at the time EPI tests are delivered, there needs to be enough cash collection history and detailed analysis performed at the payer level to substantiate an accrual for likely payment. Given how recently EPI has been commercially launched, it is our current view that there will not be enough cash collection and substantial analysis completed to allow for accrual-based revenue recognition until at least the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 and perhaps not until Q1 of fiscal year 2020. Thus, as it pertains to EPI this year, we will be focusing our dialogue on current test trends, private payor contract coverage and public reimbursement decisions knowing that the revenue recognition will lag. As Chuck has stated, the test ramp is impressive increasing approximately 25% per month and with 32 sales rep all trained, we expect the test ramp to keep increasing at this rate. Moving on to operating margin. For the Diagnostics and Genomics segment at 6.9%, the Diagnostics segment\u2019s operating margin was substantially lower than the prior year. However, excluding dilution from Exosome Diagnostics acquisition, operating margin for the segment was 20.3% or 40 basis points better than last year. The margin improvement was largely due to favorable product mix. In summary for the quarter, our breadth of growth continues to be solid both in terms of end markets and product categories. The overall growth was in line with our expectations while our overall adjusted operating margin performance was better than expected largely due to favorable mix. On the bottom line, tax reform continues to be a real positive for Bio-Techne as it was for most U.S.-based companies. As we look out to the remainder of the fiscal year ahead, our view remains much the same as the quarter ago. We expect our legacy business to continue to execute to a strategic plan as it has the past several years. For fiscal 2019, this means the least highest single-digit organic revenue growth, keeping in mind that in the near-term the most difficult year-over-year comp resides in our fiscal Q2. Executing this plan also means holding the strong operating margins we have maintained in our legacy core reagent portfolio while rapidly expanding operating margins in our fast-growing genomics and instrument platforms. As we\u2019ve stated last quarter, depending on how the relative mix of our businesses turns out, adjusting operating margins for the legacy total company therefore excluding Exosome Diagnostics could be anywhere between flat to 100 basis points improvement in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018. Although, with our most recent performance, it appears the upper end of that range looks more promising. As for Exosome Diagnostics, the outcome for the year is much more difficult to predict largely due to the accounting for revenue recognition and the uncertainty of timing for Medicare reimbursement approval. What we are focused on is continuing to drive the EPI test count higher so that when we have Medicare approval and enough history for accrual-based revenue recognition, we will be entering fiscal year 2020 on a trajectory to hit our five-year strategic goal of $150 million of annual revenue from this business unit in fiscal 2023.  Of course, in doing so, we\u2019ll be mindful of the bottom line and measuring additional investment that\u2019s commensurate with hitting our sales rep productivity goals and ensuring Medicare approval. In the very near term, be aware that Q1 recorded two months of expenses from the Exosome acquisition while Q2 and beyond will reflect a full three months. Thus, we expect overall company margins to slightly decline sequentially in Q2 before improving the back half of the year. That concludes my prepared comments. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Naomi to open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll go ahead and take our first question from Dan Arias from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Dan Arias : Chuck, I wanted to spend a few minutes on the Diagnostic and Genomics segment. First on the OEM timing issues, how much revenue fell out of the quarter there and will that be mostly recognized in 2Q, or do you expect that to be recouped over the course of the year? And then on ACD, I think you mentioned 30% growth in the research setting and double digits overall. What specifically was the all-in growth rate for ACD? And then what are you expecting for the all-in growth rate for ACD for the year? ChuckKummeth: First on the one, the quarter for the Diagnostics, the tool side of the business, it was about like last quarter and probably just a little bit better. Looking forward, what fell out was between $1 million and $2 million probably. Looking forward, I think it\u2019ll come back. These are large customers that - they don\u2019t even tell us which quarter. They can move these orders, as you know, as much as a year. I do think we\u2019ll get these things back with some -- with more even. The pipeline, as I mentioned, looks pretty good. And we have some new business in the pipeline that we aren\u2019t prepared to talk about yet. It also looks good looking out two quarters from now. So we\u2019re negotiating on many fronts. Part of that issue too is glucose. You know we have definitely holding our own with glucose. There\u2019s been some price increases as well to deal with some of it. But as you know it\u2019s the category going away over the next five years, so it\u2019s going to be a harvest kind of a mode. So, I think we\u2019re okay with that performance next couple of years, but we do have to replace it. So that\u2019s one issue there. In terms of specifics around ACD, we\u2019re not really going to give as much specifics as we used to. So we mentioned we were at just south of 30% in RUO. It is largely like last quarter, I\u2019d say even a little better as well than last quarter.  Looking forward, we see more of the same. Any softness in the overall number is probably still from the lag and the slowness and the pickup on the CDx side with Leica and other potential partners. They do tell us a strong story, though. Leica in particular has half a dozen new tests coming, and they are going to come out anywhere between the next 3 months and 18 months. So we\u2019re actually quite bullish on our partnerships and hoping to solicit more here as well, and there\u2019s more to be had. There's discussions going on as well. So, it\u2019s kind of more of the same, the same kind of rates we had talked about for the Genomics division. Looking forward, I don\u2019t see anything really falling out of place there. Dan Arias : So the forecast on ACD relative to last quarter is unchanged in your mind? ChuckKummeth: I would say yes. Dan Arias : And then just on Exosome, you talked about a $30 million contribution this year from EPI. Obviously, it sounds like a recognition math changes that. So, I just wanted to clarify what, if anything, you were expecting this year. And then are you able to talk to, A, maybe the bolus of revenues that you think you might realize once you do get Medicare approval, and B, maybe a sense for test volumes that you\u2019re expecting this year, since it sounds like visibility there is better than revenue visibility? Thank you. Chuck Kummeth : So we want to give some clarity and visibility around test volume. We told you how the Q1 went for the calendar year and how the first quarter, which we only realized two months of it \u2013 and we\u2019re on a 25% growth clip per month. We\u2019ve gone from 14 reps to 32, who I would say by January 1, all 32 should be fully up to speed and really in the groove. And then you can do your own ratios from there and see how the ramp should be. You move that kind of ramp forward, we are watching and I wouldn\u2019t say throttling, but we\u2019re definitely watching and helping them with their P&L so that we\u2019re not getting too far ahead of our skis on dilution. We came in the quarter just under the predicted spend, so even though we are a little bit light on what would\u2019ve been expected for test volume and then revenue if we could\u2019ve collected it, we are definitely okay on the spend side because we\u2019re watching and kind of tailoring as we go. A move from 7 to 32 reps in six months is a big move. It\u2019s a lot to absorb. As you know, the full plan to get to that number we talked about a quarter ago, $30 million, which we aren\u2019t going to talk about anymore in terms of what that is, because we don\u2019t know as Jim stated, when we really can collect, so it could move into next year even by a quarter. But the test volume is what matters. And I think that that\u2019s a number of 60 reps, and we\u2019ll just have to see how we grow and we want to feed that beast in as smart a way as possible. The leadership we have there we\u2019re thrilled with. The commercial leadership is fantastic. We are attracting reps from all the players and all the competitors because everybody knows that we can make payroll for them, whereas the start-up probably couldn\u2019t. So it looks pretty bullish. So we\u2019ll just have to see. And then we\u2019re being told, of course, for the decision, we\u2019re told that the volume demand could double to triple overnight with that decision. We just don\u2019t know. It\u2019s growing pretty well without it, to be honest. So we\u2019re really kind of happy. Without the decision, we\u2019re still growing at 25% per month. What that entails out in terms of revenue when we\u2019ll get it? Well, what happens now is we\u2019re told there\u2019s no guarantee on a look back of 12 months, but that\u2019s been kind of the norm. And as you know, when a decision for Medicare goes out and goes out on the wire, what usually goes out with it is what is going to be allowed to be paid and what\u2019s been submitted. And of course we have our submissions in and will be going in, and they\u2019ll make that decision on what they\u2019ll pay as they give the decision. And we\u2019ll be going back to look back a full 12 months, of which - not even right now, not until next August - a lot of that will just go through purchase accounting. It\u2019s like it won\u2019t even be considered revenue. So we\u2019ve got this safety area for a while. I would say we\u2019re not really strategically in trouble with Medicare until next summer, so - but to wait that long? We don\u2019t think it will take that long. And as Jim pointed out, we\u2019re getting dangerously close to the end of the year where we won\u2019t even need to worry about NCCN guidelines for 2018 because the year is almost over. So they submitted their guidelines last year in September. So they\u2019re already late. So we\u2019re waiting, but we can\u2019t hound them. It\u2019s a committee that we have to leave alone, of course. So we\u2019ve been told that everything is in place. We know they have a heavy agenda. As you know, there are other 300 solutions that have been in the guidelines for three years and this makes a fourth and we think we\u2019re the best of the four, so I\u2019m sure that gives them a conundrum to discuss as well, which we know nothing about. But we\u2019re all real positive. The team is just positive and it\u2019s just a matter of when. And I think it\u2019ll be soon. Does that help? Dan Arias : It does. Thank you. Operator : We'll move on to the next question from Puneet Souda from Leerink. Please go ahead. Puneet Souda : Wanted to touch first on the Protein Platforms. You saw solid growth there. Ella, I think you commented about 70% growth. Just wanted to get a sense of what was driving that and is there anything unique there? Or is it just the antibodies that are doing well? Just help us understand what\u2019s driving the growth there? ChuckKummeth: Thanks for the question, Puneet. I\u2019d love to talk about this business all day long. It is just lighting it up. So as you know, we took a gamble on that side of the technology almost five years ago now, and it\u2019s taken a while to get to a point of being material, which it is finally. And you know a 70% growth rate on this business being material, if this continues it\u2019s going to be maybe all we\u2019re talking about in a year or two. The clinicals that it\u2019s involved in are going very, very well. They\u2019re taking lots of cartridges. And these are very, very big pharma companies. We have other initiatives in place. It takes a couple of years to get rolling on these clinicals. We have got half a dozen to a dozen other pharma that are ramping up doing things. So we expect there to be strong growth. And then this Micropoint deal we just did in China, which had TV coverage by the way. It was amazing. This is the company with a founder who was the founder of Mindray, so this is a company and a team that knows what they\u2019re doing. I love this application, because it\u2019s for ubiquitous patient monitoring, going after cytokine storm and a lot of autoimmune different diseases. It\u2019ll be - it\u2019s a high throughput system for an A-rated hospital setting. So once we think that kicks in there, it\u2019ll - and they\u2019re doing all the FDA requirements. They\u2019re covering everything for us over there. We just have to supply cartridges and the instruments. And they\u2019ll rewrap them, and there's no real change to any design, anything. It\u2019s just really an integration, and OEM kind of an agreement.  And the numbers are staggering. So we\u2019ll talk more about them once they get started, because it\u2019s an 18-month clinical they have to do. But these guys have a pedigree that gets things done, so we\u2019re pretty impressed, and hoping that'll incite a lot of other interest here in the U.S. as well. So Ella has got a strong future, and we said all along we thought it could become a standard and potentially a point-of-care standard with some - our ability to work. And you know, we\u2019ll see. Puneet Souda : And then briefly on China, just wanted to get a sense, it seems like it\u2019s fairly low in terms of any tariff impact now, but what\u2019s your view? Obviously, you have a lot more reagents versus hardware. So how should we - any sense that you\u2019re getting in China that reagents could face similar tariffs in the longer term? Or any sense there? What\u2019s your outlook for the fiscal year here in China, given the growth profile that you\u2019re already getting? Chuck Kummeth : Well, this is probably the best growth we\u2019ve seen in a couple of years, at least, maybe longer. I\u2019m not sure. It\u2019s solid in the 30s percent. And we really grew on all fronts. The PrimeGene business really has come back really strong, everything from its OEM component to the China to China component. The CFDA Baidu scandal thing\u2019s behind us and hospitals are buying. So they\u2019ve got their certificates, so things seem to be ramping well there. We\u2019re getting involved in more potential GMP-grade demand products that are going into oncology and different solutions in China. Not so different than the rest of the world chasing cell therapy and looking for GMP-grade everything. We are all going to be riding this GMP-grade set of reagents very soon and I predict a shortage probably in five years if we don\u2019t all start capitalizing towards it.  What\u2019s great for us is we\u2019re picking up share because these little guys that can\u2019t afford, they were biting our ankles three, four, five years ago. They\u2019re going to disappear because they can\u2019t make the investment and the requirements are now getting much more stringent. There\u2019s been an outcry for quality validated antibodies that\u2019s been heard. And us top five, or six, or seven suppliers have heard those cries in delivering validated antibodies, and a lot of those little guys are going away. So in terms of China, it all flows well there for China as well. The instrument business is flowing quite well there. There\u2019s a lot of need for it. There may have been a few machines where some people afraid the tariffs might hit them later. There could\u2019ve been some of that, not a lot. In general, our products, especially the reagents and the tools, they go into programs that are really government-funded. The government\u2019s not stupid there. They know that if they\u2019re raising tariffs on products that they\u2019re into buying, they\u2019re going to end up paying more for, it is kind of silly, so we\u2019re not really affected by too much. We\u2019ve been kind of omitted from all that. It could happen but there aren\u2019t any local suppliers. We\u2019ll pass it on and the government will just have to pay more. So that\u2019s the way it\u2019ll be. So far there\u2019s been no impact and our demand has improved, our growth has improved, our results have improved. And we have now knocking on 150 employees in China and this is the best time we\u2019ve seen in China in a couple years, so. Puneet Souda : And just last one on Academia. Just wanted to get your view on the full fiscal year with Asia's looking good. What sort of growth rate should we be sort of modeling here going into the year? Chuck Kummeth : Low double-digit like it\u2019s been. We won\u2019t see any change. Operator : We\u2019ll move on to our next question from Catherine Schulte from Baird. Please go ahead. Catherine Schulte : Congrats on the quarter and thanks for the questions. Just going off of Puneet\u2019s last question, just curious if you could talk about end market performance within protein sciences? What did you see in pharma versus in the government and so on? Chuck Kummeth : Pretty balanced. Double-digit in here, both categories. Academic, it\u2019s a little higher than biopharma here in the U.S. But in that area, that\u2019s probably including the services side. I\u2019d say it\u2019s pretty balanced here in the U.S., too. If you\u2019re talking just protein science, it\u2019s pretty balanced. Low double-digit. Catherine Schulte : And then on the M&A front, how would you characterize your appetite as we stand today and where within your portfolio would you most like to add? And then with the recent pullback in the market, does that increase your interest in public assets? Or are you going to remain more on the private side? Chuck Kummeth : We\u2019ll probably remain more on the private side. We\u2019re just a titch over two times on leverage. We definitely have some capacity but we did five deals this last year and we\u2019re integrating. We have enough on our plate. We know how important it is to get Exosome Diagnostics right. We are definitely at the inflection growth area where we need to really take Genomics division to the next level. It\u2019s a $60 million, $70 million run-rate business as we\u2019ve talked about last quarter. It\u2019s growing in the numbers we\u2019ve told you. And so that still needs attention. We have new leadership there as well. We\u2019re expanding in Europe and we\u2019re just getting off the ground with that in Asia. We have the Atlanta Biologics we don\u2019t talk much about but it is a media business, a serum business. We\u2019ve got ideas to expand it globally and rebranding it with R&D systems. It takes some work. We have some smaller ones as well that don\u2019t take a lot of work. But somebody has to be assigned to it so it\u2019s always something. So we\u2019re a little busy right now. So where are we interested? We still run a process. Frank\u2019s still pretty busy here. We run a meeting every two weeks. Our hopper\u2019s still over 100. It\u2019s definitely more private than public. I don\u2019t see a lot of prices going down an awful lot for the private especially the sizes we look at. Where we\u2019re most interested is probably still working through this flywheel for cell therapies. There\u2019s a lot more positions in the wheel that we don\u2019t have. We\u2019ve got a lot of positions. We\u2019re definitely a player now. We love that. We\u2019re getting a lot more interest because of it. We\u2019re getting more critical mass. But there are certain other areas. A wonderful bio-reactor solution came into sight. We\u2019d be looking at it. We\u2019re still looking at things in single-cell areas. There\u2019s interest levels, areas we\u2019re looking at still. There\u2019s quality control. There\u2019s pieces of that cell therapy work flow that \u2013 there are some nice, small companies that have formed and are growing and riding that wave. The numbers \u2013 you know as well as I do the numbers predicted in CAR-T and in cell therapies in general the next five years are staggering. So I do think it\u2019s going to be an everybody-wins market if you just get in. So it\u2019s a matter of getting land at this point. Operator : We'll go ahead and take our next question from Patrick Donnelly from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Patrick Donnelly : Maybe just one on ACD, the clinical opportunity there. I know you mentioned Leica maybe taking a little bit longer to pick up than you expected. Can you just talk through the opportunity there, again acknowledging it\u2019s early? And then also, I know you guys aren\u2019t exclusive with Leica, so is there opportunities to expand to other partners? Any thoughts there would be great. Chuck Kummeth : So Leica is our first partner and our primary partner, but we\u2019re not exclusive and we are working with Entana and there\u2019s some things going on there. And we\u2019ve got some notes, Jim\u2019s looking up a few notes here as well. I like the menu and what they\u2019re forward in Leica. They are trying very hard, they seem very serious. We are definitely also working with Entana and we\u2019re working with some others as well. We\u2019re not going to name them right now, but there\u2019s strong interest. As we get critical mass, I think there\u2019s going to be interest. This tissue biopsy technology really works. And the market understands what in situ hybridization is because it\u2019s been around a while, it\u2019s just never had a solution that worked this well before. So as we transition from really research, where people get trained and publications will happen and critical mass will happen and awareness growth. It\u2019ll grow more and more towards a pathologist I think and CDx - companion diagnostic capabilities - is where there\u2019s going to be the next wave of attraction. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s overnight, this stuff takes time, but the scale is big. I mean these are billion dollar markets to get into these areas. And so we just have to be patient and patient we will be. Patrick Donnelly : And then maybe staying on ACD, just since the payout occurred - I know there\u2019s always risk of increased employee attrition, people leaving, any pull forward on the revenues hit the mouth - can you just talk to what you\u2019ve been seeing since then? Clearly the underlying trends seem pretty healthy. But just curious on the inside what you guys are seeing there. Chuck Kummeth : On ACD? Patrick Donnelly : Yes. Chuck Kummeth : Which we call Genomics division now. Yeah. So the leader left recently. We brought in and we talked about it probably four months ago or so. Kim came in. Kim was running Genomics, pretty much all of Genomics except for Ion Torrent I think from Thermo Fisher. He\u2019s worked for me before. I know him from my Thermo days. He came via BD. He has an outstanding track record. This guy is a leader. I think he knows virus safe languages. He\u2019s a super good global leader. He\u2019s a team player and he\u2019s got his hands personally on this. He actually lives just across the bridge from where the office is. So it\u2019s not a big operation yet in terms of what Kim\u2019s experience is, so it\u2019s kind of child\u2019s play for him really. He has that along with the Diagnostics division as well. In terms of right now what we\u2019re working on? We want to make sure that the team stays intact. It has been. We have \u2013 the company\u2019s Chief Medical Officer is Rob Monroe, who is from that business unit. All the scientists are still intact. We have retention packages in for all key people, of course, that\u2019s going to run out a few years. These segments have never been better. So I think we\u2019re in a good place. If you want to work for a great company and be part of an exploding division, this is a good place to come. Tissue biopsy is going to be a big deal in a lot of areas and we have a close cousin now, a technology platform with a lipid biopsy, with Exosome of course as well, which we\u2019ll be doing things together in the future, but not yet. There is certainly competitive forces, being they\u2019re in Newark and it\u2019s the Bay area, but I think we\u2019re doing okay with that so far. Patrick Donnelly : And if I could just sneak one last one in, just on Europe. It continues to be a standout there with mid-teens growth. Can you just talk about the durability of double-digit growth there? Any key markets you\u2019re looking at that have really driven the outperformance that you feel good about over the next year or so? Chuck Kummeth : We study the situation best we can. Europe is Europe. And I\u2019m not sure anyone gets three to five years of prosperity in Europe without a hiccup. But we\u2019ve had a couple at least here. I think the next big risk would be some surprised that happen around a hard Brexit. I\u2019m not even convinced a hard Brexit will occur. But if it does, we studied what it does to us and it doesn\u2019t do anything material to us whatsoever. So we think we\u2019re all right. Again, we have the kind of products and tools in place that customers want, and these customers are in large part very academic or biotech company-related and they\u2019ll get it if they need it. If we end up having to do something around prices because of some arrangements with the EU or the U.K., we\u2019ll deal with it. But our model right now suggests that we don\u2019t have anything material to worry about there. Funding of course is on a country by country basis in Europe and remains pretty strong across the board. I think we\u2019re still living off of the nice balance we\u2019ve gotten here from going fully all-Europe with subsidiaries across all the countries in Europe buying out our distributors and keeping their teams excited, and they\u2019re on board. They all stayed on board, the leaders of these businesses. And expanding and taking share locally in these countries. So right now it looks pretty good. I think we\u2019re trying to crack and get more into Eastern Europe. I ran with a good idea for a while. And we still look at other areas as well. Israel\u2019s a strong area for us. I think Russia eventually will be good. Not yet, though. But those are all going to be a gravy layer. The main thing for us to get right is to continue seeing strength in UK and Germany. Germany and U.K. are roughly the same size and Germany should be bigger, so we would say there\u2019s still more share to get in Germany, to be honest. France has come up nicely, mainly because of we bought Eurosome, which is located in France, so now we have a French subsidiary and it allows us to actually again get a little more, a little deeper into the country. Italy is also a little surprising, but again this is where we bought out space and really our Southern European operations, our leadership all come from that entity. And so of course Italy gets taken care of, and there\u2019s always been strong research in Italy. So that\u2019s all looking pretty good. So outside of a scare like a new Greece or Italy runs into trouble with going back to the lira or something, who knows, these all cause short-term hops in Europe, but you guys will see it before we see it. Right now, it\u2019s looking good. Operator : We\u2019ll move onto our next question from Dan Leonard from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Dan Leonard : So hoping - appreciate the color on broad-based strength and Protein Sciences, but hoping you could offer some color on the biologics product lines, not Atlanta, but the capital area - Electro free products that rebounded last quarter, or a couple of quarters that had a pickup? Chuck Kummeth : It\u2019s improved. But the comps have been strong still. I mean this last quarter was still a 30-plus percent come. And we did okay, and it\u2019s obviously reflected in our numbers. So looking forward I think we see improvements. But this isn\u2019t a unique solution where we have kind of the whole market to ourselves, like we do with Western blotting. This is the one we are competing with other technologies, everything from iron exchange, which is still a primary solution used in production, which we fight every day. These large customers, the development team fights the manufacturing team on what should be used in production. We\u2019ve been winning with our iCE platform but there has been a tough fight. We definitely had some softness a couple of quarters ago. Some of it related to some of that but also related to the fact that we don\u2019t have the Empower limb system integrated, where a lot of manufacturing sites require Empower out of Waters. We are in full-blown development of that now, and we\u2019ll have that - we are six months into it actually. We hope to have it released by next summer. And just the messaging of that has helped the platform, to be honest. These guys don\u2019t make knee-jerk decisions, right? They\u2019re specifying platforms for their production QC for new generations and for the long term, so this is helping improve the category. We still - I think we\u2019re still not has happy as we\u2019d like to see on the size side. Charge, we\u2019re okay but on size, which was the new Maurice platform, I think there\u2019s still more share to get. And then we\u2019re also looking at expanding, getting more application help, and helping drive against those competitive forces. And so far, so good, Dan. The numbers have improved there, so we\u2019ll see how it goes. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re back in the days of 40% growth anymore with that platform, but double-digit is certainly realistic. Dan Leonard : And just an operating expense question for Jim. Jim, I was surprised that R&D expenses didn\u2019t tick-up more sequentially given you had two months of Exosome. Was there anything timing related or does Exosome just have fewer folks working in R&D than I thought? Jim Hippel : No, there was some timing items. In fact, some of the same folks who work on development of cartridges for Simple Plex, for new cartridges, as well as in our own facility here in Minneapolis, some of the folks that work on new protein development, they ebb and flow between development and operations when there\u2019s certainly demand flows. And this quarter in particular, particularly on the Simple Plex side, there was high demand to get cartridges to customers, and so there was a shift from those resources developing new cartridges to producing cartridges for sale. And we expect that shift will - they caught up essentially with that backlog and we expect that shift will move back to more R&D and expense in the forward quarters. Chuck Kummeth : So this is an area we do some activity basic on and they\u2019re coded between research versus manufacturing. And this was a heavy manufacturing quarter and you saw by the numbers you gave you on Simple Plex, it\u2019s just exploding. So we\u2019re going to be hiring more and probably expanding there, and more probably more on the R&D side. So that\u2019ll level out. We still stay committed to I think our levels of investment that we\u2019ve always been. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We have no further questions at this time. I would like to turn it back over to you. Chuck Kummeth : Okay. Well, we\u2019re about on the hour anyway, so that\u2019s fine. Thank you, everybody, for the great call and the great questions. And, of course, we'll be following up with most of you on one-on-ones after this, and I look forward to talking to you all again next quarter. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Bio-Techne Earnings Conference Call for the Second Quarter of Fiscal Year 2019. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the call will be opened for questions following the management's prepared remarks. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jim Hippel, Bio-Techne's Chief Financial Officer. Jim Hippel : Good morning and thank you for joining us. On the call with me this morning is Chuck Kummeth, Chief Executive Officer of Bio-Techne. Before we begin, let me briefly cover our Safe Harbor statement. Some of the comments made during this conference call may be considered forward-looking statements, including beliefs and expectations about the company's future results. The company's 10-K for fiscal year 2018 identifies certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements made during this call. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of any new information or future events or developments. The 10-K as well as the company's other SEC filings are available on the company's website within its Investor Relations section. During the call, non-GAAP financial measures may be used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. Tables reconciling these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available in the company's press release issued earlier this morning on the Bio-Techne Corporation website at www.bio-techne.com. I'll now turn the call over to Chuck. Chuck Kummeth : Thanks, Jim and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us for our second quarter conference call. I'm happy to report that the strength in our core businesses that we experienced back in Q1 of our fiscal year '19 continued in the second quarter. The company delivered a 11% organic growth in the quarter, led again by our Protein Sciences segment with stellar 14% organic growth for the second quarter in a row. What makes Q2 more impressive than Q1 however, is the much stronger comp we faced this quarter. You may recall last year the overall company organically grew 14% in Q2 while the Protein Sciences segment grew 15%. This quarter marks the first time Bio-Techne has organically lapped double digit growth with double digit growth. Our strategic plan first rolled out five years ago had a long-term goal for the company to be a perennial double digit grower. It is satisfying for my team and putting all the employees of Bio-Techne to have reached this important milestone and by continuing to execute in our strategy, we believe we are still at the beginning of our growth journey. If you look at our performance by geography, all major regions continued to perform exceedingly well. The only regions with less than double digit growth were Europe and Japan with growth of nearly 20% Q2 of last year for Europe and over 10% growth last year in Japan, single digit growth in Q2 of this year, these regions were still respectable. Meanwhile, the US and the rest of Asia executed exceptionally well. Especially considering a challenge in nature for this year-over-year Comp. In Q2 the US grew in the low teens over the prior year quarter, which also saw growth and the teens. China grew at 30% this quarter versus the second quarter of last year, which also saw growth of nearly 30%. In fact, China grew 30% for the first half of our current fiscal year marking the first time China has experienced over 30% organic growth in two consecutive quarters. Having such growth in all regions while facing very strong comps from the prior year of great, but I'm more pleased with the consistency of our growth rates as a company over the past several quarters, I believe it speaks to the strength of our product portfolio, the scale of markets these products address and the momentum behind the fine execution of our strategic plan. So now let's talk a bit about performance per products starting with the Protein Sciences segment. We experienced growth in nearly every single major product category and double digit growth in most. Our instant based solutions continued to receive great acceptance in the market with our automated western blot solutions growing nearly 30% and Q2 as it also did in Q1. The Biologics iCE platform grew 20% in the quarter and our automated ELISA solution, Ella grew nearly 50%. Despite the tremendous momentum we currently have these platforms. We never rest on our laurels and continually seek to meet or exceed our customer's needs through innovation. For example, we recently announced the launch of a capillary electrophoresis SDS PLUS system for the Marurice instrument with novel cartridges, buffers and software for further enhancement of size based protein characterization and purity analysis. Also, we launched a new customizable for cartridge format the SimplePlex. SimplePlex collects Ella amino acid platform. The new open access 48 sample cartridge enabled researchers who are studying unique biomarker finishers that leverage their own segment, their own reagents to build custom immunoassays on the Ella platform. Both of these new launches are examples of how we continue to develop robust tools that simplify applications and remove complexity enabling researchers to focus on their science. Growth in the protein sciences segment also benefited from continued strength in our core reagents, especially antibodies and cell and gene therapy applications, both of which grew more than 20% in the quarter. Bio-Techne's solutions for the cell therapy workflow span across our product portfolio and include GMP cytokines and growth factors, GMP small molecules, GMP media and high quality antibodies for flow cytometry and immunocytochemical characterization. The use of GMP agents early in the manufacturing process is highly advantageous as it eases the cell therapy workflow transition from bench to clinic by preventing the need to switch to GMP at a later stage when the cost and risk of change is higher and the freedom of change is lower. In addition, Bio-Techne is focused on developing innovative and technological pioneering solutions that optimize and simplify cell therapy manufacturing, Cloudz, trademarked Cell Activation Kits and the SimplePlex immunoassays. These technologies are designed to expedite cell expansion and improve product quality control respectively. We in Bio-Techne are excited to lead the way in the production of innovative GMP reagents and highly technical solutions for cell therapy development and manufacturing worldwide. Moving on to our Diagnostics and Genomic segment where we returned a growth in Q2 albeit modestly. The ramp of OEM orders in our Diagnostics division continues to build and we foresee year-over-year revenue growth rates continue to improve in the back half of the fiscal year. As for Genomics division, Q2 of last year was the bigger in all quarter for the prior management team where they aggressively sold RNAscope assays and pharmaceutical services to achieve nearly 50% growth, making it an almost insurmountable comp to beat this quarter. Despite the challenge, the division still delivered year-over-year growth in both RUO and diagnostic product revenue. Going forward with leadership in place, executing on more long-term customer retention strategies, the team has reinvigorated to get the division to solid double digit growth with an addressable market size over $1 billion in superior RNA ISH technology in situ hybridization, nothing less is acceptable. Finally, an update on ExosomeDx, last week we announced the National Comprehensive Cancer Network or NCCN, decision to include EPI as a recommended test and a clinical practice guidelines in oncology for prostate cancer early detection. The updated treatment algorithm includes EPI testing prior to a first prostate biopsy for after a negative biopsy to assist patients, neurologist and further define the probability of high grade cancer and in reaching a joint decision to either proceed with a prostate biopsy or continue monitoring. The NCCN guidelines are recognized clinical standard for cancer care by clinicians and payers in the United States. The guidelines are developed and revised by a panel of expert physicians from 28 leading US cancer centers. The panel revises recommended practice guidelines according to current clinical evidence and advances in cancer care. When we acquired ExosomeDx, we knew could be a platform that could transform a rapidly growing field of liquid biopsy. We also felt the synergies of ExosomeDx molded remarkably well with our ACD team, the tissue biopsy platform and our immuno therapeutic tools like cell culture. The ExosomeDx team has worked extremely hard these past few years to get to this point of adoption and professional recognition of its EPI test and the value it brings with both patients and payers. These new guidelines are critical in our efforts to broaden insurance coverage, including Medicare coverage, which we are pursuing with professional rigor. Inclusion in the guidelines will also broaden patient access to the EPI test by affirming its value in men evaluating whether to proceed with a prostate biopsy. Men over 50 with an inconclusive PSA level between two and 10, now have another course of diagnosis before yield to a painful and risky prostate biopsy. Even before NCCN guidelines or without Medicare reimbursement approval, EPI is rapidly gaining acceptance among urologist throughout the country. Over 4000 patient tests were performed in Q2 and more than a 1100 physicians have requested over 12,000 kits for future use on their patients, double from what we were requested in Q1. This level of enthusiasm by the urology community and now with NCCN guideline inclusion gives us added confidence that EPI will be expeditiously added to the NGS local coverage determination for Medicare reimbursement. With regard to non-Medicare payers, the Exosome team continues to make great progress with payer coverage. They have contract with 25 regional, commercial and PPO networks nationwide and have Medicaid enrolled and 25 states. Going forward, the team has an aggressive pipeline and timeline to continue and expand the coverage of both private and public payers. Of course, the biggest payer of all given the demographics of those most selected to benefit from an EPI test is Medicare, which means that we won't start seeing meaningful revenue in the near term until we have Medicare reimbursement approval. EPI is the first diagnostic test of many using both urine and blood derived Exosomes that we will seek approval over the coming years. Our Exosome driven diagnostics platform is unique in the liquid biopsy field and is positioned to become a true standard of care for diagnosing, treating and monitoring cancers as well as other diseases. Our diagnostic products will enable physicians to take a more targeted and precise approach in their treatment strategies and that's improved patient outcomes while lowering overall health care costs. Before turning the call over to Jim, as I often do, I would like to conclude my prepared remarks to comment about our adjusted operating margin performance. While we did indeed experience a 250 basis points year-over-year decline to adjusted operating margin in Q2 due to the acquisitions we've made over the past year, namely ExosomeDx, I'm very pleased report that excluding these acquisitions our adjusted operating margins for the quarter grew 260 basis points year-over-year. I believe this demonstrates our commitment to holding our historically strong core margins while ramping profitably in the businesses we have acquired over the past five years. The team has done a fantastic job executing on productivity and focused investment to overdrive revenue and margin performance, helping mitigate the short-term impact for delayed reimbursement and deferred revenue recognition that we are experienced in ExosomeDx. But the first half of fiscal '19 now behind us, the overall core business is executing better than ever and the predicted outcome of the strategy we first outlined five years ago is becoming a reality. With that I'll turn the call over to Jim. Jim Hippel : Great, thanks Chuck. I'll provide an overview of our Q2 financial performance for the total company as well as provide some color on each of our segments. Starting with the overall second quarter financial performance, adjusted EPS increased 4% to $1.06, while GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.45 compared to $1.29 in the prior year. Q2 reported revenue was 174.5 million, an increase our 13% year-over-year with organic revenue increasing 11%. Second quarter reported sales include a 3% growth contribution from acquisitions and a 1% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange translation. By geography, the US grew in the low teens. Europe, organic growth was in the high single digits, while China grew over 30%. As for the rest of Asia, organic growth was in the mid teens led by South Korea and India. By end market, biopharma growth was approximately 10%, while academic sales growth was in the mid-single digits. Moving on to the details of the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin was up 60 basis points compared to the prior year at 70.8% in Q2. Favorable product mix and operational productivity partially offset for the mix from recent acquisition. Adjusted SG&A in Q2 was 29.2% of revenue, flat to Q1and 300 basis points higher than the prior year, while volume leverages more than offset by the additional SG&A added as a result of acquisitions. R&D expense in Q2 was 9.1% of revenue, also flat to Q1 and prior year. The resulting adjusted operating margin for Q2 was 32.5%, a decrease of 250 basis points from the prior year period. However, as Chuck already mentioned, excluding the impact from recent acquisitions, core adjusted operating margins expanded 260 basis points here year-over-year. This was driven by strong volume leverage, favorable product mix and solid operational productivity. For GAAP reporting, SG&A in Q2 of last year reflects a $12.4 million charge for the fair market value adjustment of the ACD earn out. The management views this charge as part of the acquisition price paid for ACD and thus it was excluded for adjusted earnings in the prior year. Looking at our numbers below operating income, net interest expense in Q2 was 5.6 million compared to 2.2 million of net interest expense last year. The higher interest expense is driven by a higher debt level that resulted from our acquisition of Exosome Diagnostics in Q1 as well as multiple LIBOR rate increases in the past year on our outstanding line of credit. Our bank debt on the balance sheet as of the end of Q2 stood at 545.4 million, down from 561.5 million at the end of Q1. Other adjusted non-operating income for the quarter was approximately $1 million, up 1.1 million from the prior year quarter due to favorable transactional foreign exchange. For GAAP reporting, other non-operating includes a $7.2 million unrealized loss from our investment in ChemoCentryx. This is due to the adoption of accounting standard updates 2016-1 recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities, which requires equity investments with readily available fair market values recorded as an asset on the balance sheet and any changes in fair market value record on the income statement. The prior standard and as reported last year required changes in fair market value recorded in the equity section of the balance sheet. Moving on down the P&L, our adjusted effective tax rate in Q2 was 21%, a 350 basis point improvement from the prior year due to tax reform. For the remainder of fiscal year '19, we expect the adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 100 basis points higher than Q2 due to some favorable timing in the current quarter does not likely to repeat. For GAAP purposes, income tax expense in the prior year includes a very large onetime benefit due to revaluation in deferred tax liabilities that resulted from tax reform. Turning to cash flow and return of capital, 46.6 million of cash was generated from operations in the second quarter, and our net investment in capital expenditures was 4.6 million, 12.1 million of dividends were paid out in the quarter and average diluted shares stood at 38.7 million shares outstanding. Also during Q2, we bought back $15.3 million worth of our own stock using most of the net proceeds from stock options that were exercised during fiscal year '18. Now, I'll discuss the performance of our reporting segments, starting with the Protein Sciences segment. Q2 reported sales were 135.5 million, with reported revenue increasing 16%. Organic growth was 14% with acquisitions contributing 3% of revenue growth and foreign exchange unfavorably impacting growth by 1%. As Chuck has already described, the growth in this segment was very broad and also every product category and geographic regions. Operating margin for the Protein Sciences segment was 43.5%, an increase of 60 basis points year-over-year due to the strong volume leverage in operational productivity partially offset by the mix of lower margin acquisitions. I'd like to reiterate Chuck's earlier comment regarding our commitment to improving the profitability from our acquisitions. As an example, this quarter a protein simple branded products achieve a new profitability record with 25% operating margin, which was approximately 400 basis points greater than prior year. Turning to the Diagnostics and Genomic segment, Q2 reported sales were 39.3 million, an increase of 6% from the prior year. Organically revenues grew 2%, are working in a very tough comp due to last year being an earn out quarter for Genomics business. Acquisitions contributed 4% of revenue, including those from Eurocell and Exosome Diagnostics. Chuck has already commentary on the test ramp of EPI. Here I'll provide some additional color on revenue and revenue recognition as it pertains to EPI. As a reminder, Exosome Diagnostics has been recognizing EPI revenue on a cash basis. This is the correct accounting treatment given its recent commercial launched in 2018. For patients insured by private payers, the cycle from test report date to payment can be quite long. This is especially true for patients covered by PPOs. For patients insured by Medicare, bill is put on hold until decision hasn't been made by CMS on reimbursement. With Medicare approval still pending and given that the majority of our private payer contracts are currently PPOs, very little of the test performed during the past five months of ownership were collected before the end of December. Thus minimal revenue from EPI was recorded in our Q2 results. Furthermore, cash collections on tests performed before the August 1 acquisition date are not recorded as revenue, but rather accounted for in the balance sheet under purchase accounting. In order to record revenue the time EPI tests were deliver there needs to be enough cash collection history and detailed analysis performed at the payroll level to substantiate and accrual for likely payment. Given how recently EPI has been commercially launched, it's our current view that there will not be enough cash collection history and substantial analysis completed to allow for accrual based revenue recognition until we get into fiscal year '20. Thus as it pertains to EPIs issue, we continue to focus our dialogue on current test trends, private payer contract coverage and public reimbursement decisions knowing that revenue recognition will lag. As Chuck has stated, the test ramp is impressive and now with NCCN guideline support it should accelerate even faster in the coming quarters. Moving on to operating margin for the Diagnostics and Genomics segment, at minus 2.7% the segment's operating margin was substantially lower than the prior year. However, excluding the dilution from the Exosome Diagnostics acquisition, operating margins were 17.7% or 180 basis points better than last year, the organic margin improvement was largely due to favorable product mix. In summary, for the quarter our breath of growth continues to be solid both in terms of end markets and product categories. Having a sequential quarter of double digit organic growth on top of the second quarter last year which was our toughest comp ever bodes well for the momentum of our portfolio as we head into second half of our fiscal year. On the bottom line our adjusted operating margin performance was in line with what we expected at the beginning of the fiscal year, but achieved a bit differently. Obviously the delay at NCCN guidelines and follow on Medicare reimbursement has increased the impact of Exosome Diagnostics dilution to our earnings from what we had anticipated at the beginning of the fiscal year. However, the stellar operational performance in our core business is mitigating most of this additional dilution and we respect this trend to continue for the remainder of the fiscal year. That concludes my prepared comments and we'd like to turn the call back over to the operator to open the line for questions? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll now take our first question from Dan Arias from Citigroup. Please go ahead Daniel Arias : Good morning guys, thanks. Chuck on the segment performance, can you just touch on reagents solutions? It sounds like things were a bit above trend there for the core biotech business and then on the analytical solution side I'm wondering about - a little color there on the business this quarter and then what that says about the outlook in the context of the 15% to 20% target that you've had there? Chuck Kummeth : Okay, great. Well, we were just chatting about this before the call. We should have probably brought out antibodies of the more than we did in the discussion or the press release or anything else, but we had a record quarter for antibodies, we were over 20, way over 20% growth. We're strong across the board. The comp on proteins from last year was like a 16% growth, so we're near flat there, but it's holding us, it it's going to ramp as the GMP goes up. So we had a stellar performance in RSD, assay is also really good across the board, royalty is strong and Lunimex, Luminex is still doing really well. If you look at our entire assay line from Ella all the way through multiplex, we're still double digit growth, so those strategies are still working flawlessly, so an exceptional quarter for that division. And on ASD, we probably got to stop saying 15% because we keep doing 20 or better. So I'd say the outlook is definitely leading towards, 20s more than 15 that we expand, a minimal of pretty strong still. What I can say about - the western blot solution, near 30 a few quarters in a row now. It really out classed the chasm and there's just lighting it up. We know it's a big market, we always said so. How many quarters did I - speaking this about, it will be a 10 year slog of 10% to 15% and then all of a sudden about a year ago it just kind of hit and its continuing. So the adoption is happening finally for making this automated western blot the new standard record out there for doing westerns in the laboratory, so we're already very happy. Biologics has bounced back nicely from about a year ago, I think. We had some pain there, it's been pretty good. And Ella is just starting to knock out of the park and other quarter 50% growth. And we don't see any end in sight. And the new cartridge platform we announced here is a big deal because this is the first cartridges, it's an open platform. So all those big guys that don't want to let their stuff out of their site, they give to us to pick a close cartridge system. Now, they can take this system and they can do it themselves, valid in and give it to us, we need to know what's in it and make the cautious one. So we're going to see even more uptick, I think on clinical and support as this thing is still asleep right, I think in terms of platform, which is about the very first acquisition we did. It's taken a few years that really is now moving fast and it's very material now in size of the company. So that addresses both those divisions for you I think. Daniel Arias : Yeah, it does. Thank you. And then maybe on Exosome, now that EPI is in the guidelines, do you feel like the pieces are in place for the LCD? I mean, obviously, the algorithm now reflects EPI as an option. But there are other parts of the document that look like they're still being updated. So I'm just - I'm curious whether you think the table is now sufficiently set for the reimbursement policy and then what's your assumption on timing at this point, if you have one? Chuck Kummeth : Yeah, so I want to make a few careful comments here. I know I do this for everyone's on the line, so that we don't have the same sets of questions coming one time afterwards. And just to make it very apparent, this is a really highly competitive space as you guys know, there's a lot of going on liquid biopsy. Everyone thinks they're better. And there's a new company every day and it's very aggressive. And I can only imagine what these poor committees between NCCN and NGS are going through trying to see who really has what it takes here to do with the real data. We know our science is undeniable. We know our results are undeniable. We do we said we'd do, we got to the NCCN, a couple of months later than we thought it'd be. We know why, we can't even tell you why. I can just say it's extremely competitive and those are the reasons. With regards to NGS, we have to go under what's called reconsideration, now for the LCD that's in process. We all know what the rule state, it's a one to six month process, we have no inside of the NGS. So we don't know. It's highly competitive. If we knew stuff, we probably couldn't tell you anyway. But we feel very, very comfortable that our science and our results will prevail and we'll get through this. It is a great test. It really works. Patients need it and it's going to happen. So whether it's next month or June, I don't know. But so I'm sure you guys are all ask again, one on one anyway, but that's what we know right now and this is a huge first step. We do think that we'll see some level of uptick, even though the grid - the test rate has been improving drastically, even though we haven't added any sales people in three months. This should even have an impact. We don't know for sure. We'll, see or know more in a month or two. But we're getting ready. As Jim stated, we have thousands and thousands of kits being requested and we're logging now 4000 plus a quarter in terms of tests and we're going a 40% to 50% growth clip right now before NCC. So I don't know what all it will move to, but a year from now, I'm sure it'll be a big, big number. Daniel Arias : Yeah, okay, thanks. Appreciate that color. If I could just maybe sneak one more in for Jim, Jim on the margins, the expansion of the core business was pretty significant. It sounds like leverage and cost discipline were pretty good there, was there anything related to the timing of hiring that maybe we should consider when we're modeling the back half? And then I guess along those lines, can you just maybe elaborate on what that means for the year if we just think about the outlook for the legacy business and then how that comes together with whatever Exosome dilution you're expecting at this point? Jim Hippel : Yeah, I mean, I think the hiring play a little bit of part of it in the sense that it's a pretty tough labor market right now in terms of finding the right people that you need. And so the businesses are a little bit behind on hiring. I wouldn't say with the biggest contribution margin expansion, the bigger contribution was the strong volume leverage and some good product mix. But nonetheless, there is a bit of that going on, and we anticipate some of those - the plan has to be filled here in the second half of the year. So having said all that, as we think about the back half of the year, we still expect strong operating margin expansion in our core business, perhaps not at the same rate that we saw in the first half and that will do a lot to help offset the dilution we're seeing in Exosome. So our total view for the year hasn't come off what an initial kind of guidance was six months ago. Chuck Kummeth : We still think it's a 200 to 400 basis point dilution, but how we get there may move around a little bit. We had such great over delivery on the core business. If that continues, we can either choose to have less dilution or invest harder. Personally, there are so many products in this Exosome platform. I would love to do more things in parallel of we could afford to. We're ready to go with clinical was on both the bladder as well as the kidney rejection signatures right now. So we're actively working on getting those clinical started with partners. Daniel Arias : Okay. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from Puneet Souda from FCB Leerink. Please go ahead. Puneet Souda : Yeah, thanks. Chuck, first on Exosome, just wanted to get a sense of now having spent some time with Exosome team knowing products more there and the pipeline. I mean, what's your confidence longer term about the estimates that you had laid out earlier for fiscal year 2022 in the 8-K? And maybe for Jim, I just wanted to ask you, on your comments around Exosome, I just wanted to make sure how are we looking at the next two fiscal quarters? Should we not be assuming any revenue there because I know Exosome actually has some RUO revenue, so I just want to make sure I have that correct. Chuck Kummeth : Yeah, so - yeah, there's not much revenue. Jim went through pretty carefully through those whole cost and cash to accrual basis, so it's going to take us probably into Q1 of next year to start really getting revenue recognized. The RUO and CDX side, there's some stuff happening there of course. We've got a lot of potential with the blood side as a platform which there's different ways to recognize revenue we're working on. But in general, in terms of us following our model and what's in the 8-K, I think we have no reason to move away from any numbers in that if anything we've said is conservative, and I think it's still conservative to be honest. Jim Hippel : Yeah, and I'll just add to that. We went to our annual strategic plan update with all the teams and the Exosome team still feels very, very comfortable and upbeat about hitting that kind of number five years out. And with regards to written on the very short term here as Chuck said, with regards to revenue in Exosome, I mean, definitely the very near term we expect revenue recognitions to be fairly minimal. The wild card in this fiscal year is still Q4. If we were able to get more earlier acceptance of Medicare reimbursement approval that could bode well for Q4, but if it's delayed and honestly we know it will continue to for recognition until we get into early part of fiscal year '20. Puneet Souda : Okay, got it. On a ACD, I just wanted to make sure I had the number, right. Can you remind me again what was ACD in the quarter? And are you - you made some comments about customer retention strategy? So I just wanted to make sure, are you seeing more increasing competition in the market or is there the market dynamics or anything that's changing in the market that's leading you to take that approach? Chuck Kummeth : No, quite the opposite actually, we're at this point now saying integration is probably complete. A year ago they finished their earn out milestone quarter and we found out this like always, they sell the desks and the chairs and everything they can and became a very tough comp. So it was - you can tell with the numbers over often segment and the lumpiness is pretty predictable on the on the diagnostics portion, so it was low single digits for the quarter coming off that cop we kind warned you about that. Looking forward, its double digit this quarter, hoping even 20 or better. We're back in place with the full team for the services part of the business. Our new leader Kim Kelderman has done a great job of really building out a strategy and going at - back after we call it we call them customer retention strategies. There have been - there was a lot of focus on getting in, but staying in is important as well with these with these big customers and that's starting to improve a lot. It is a big market and it is no less that big market then like the western blot was for protein simple. It just takes a while to get some traction get going here, but I feel actually better about the long-term growth for the Genomics division and it probably was around the western blot solution two, three years ago to be honest. It's a master - and we got a pipeline of products coming, we haven't talked about yet, we've got BasePlex and HighPlex coming, DNAscope is coming and RNAscope is really just starting to get rolling to be honest. So we've got partnerships with all the automation players out there, formerly with Leica, but we have relationships forming and beginning with the others as well and that's going to bode well also. So this too is a technology that is incredible science and really works and there's a lot we can do with it, so we intend to. Puneet Souda : Okay, that's very helpful. And this last one if I could squeeze in, in China obviously a strong quarter, just wanted to get a sense of what's exactly driving the growth there and maybe if you can give us some update on PrimeGene if that's part of the growth? Chuck Kummeth : That's part of it, so we're kind of through the melee we had with them a couple years ago and they're feeding cell therapy accounts, they're back in the hospitals with different systems, the growth rates are very large there actually and help contribute to that 30% overall. RUO there - our R&D Systems brand continues to be a 25% or better grower, hasn't stopped and never did. And the instruments had a north of 50% kind of growth rate, so we had a very, very good quarter in China, but our all instrument peers out there also had pretty good quarters in China. Probably a bit of it is - could be buy forwards, off tariff scare, although all the others have commented there isn't a lot of tariff issues with the life sciences segments in China, but there could be some of that. We always worth 30% or better for the instruments there and this was an exceptionally strong quarter. I'd like to thank for the execution. We have built our team bigger. We have an applications lab, demo lab now there performing, so we have new people now in different cities. It's just expanding and I think we're starting to get more of a an accelerate stride or rather still - we're still overall the company a $50 million kind of business in China. So there's a lot of room for growth at this level in my opinion still. We've always said kind of 25 ish our goal get two quarters that 30% or better, I'd like 30 better, I'd like to think we can continue there, but we'll see. Puneet Souda : Operator : Our next question comes from Catherine Schulte from Baird. Please go ahead. Catherine Schulte : Hey guys, congrats on the quarter. And thanks for the questions. You previously guided to at least high single digit organic growth for fiscal '19, any change to that now that you've finished the first half of the year with double digit growth, just how should would we be thinking about the back half? Chuck Kummeth : Well, maybe put in my comments about employees all being effective of hitting two quarters in a row and being the perennial double digit grower which was our goal. We're probably still going to speak in terms of range. We've been saying 8 to 12, let's say 9.5 to 12. So it's hard to promise 10. 10s a big number to promise, but we're certainly seem to be doing it and doing it quite easily here right now. So we'll see. Catherine Schulte : Great and then can you just give us some thoughts on your outlook in Europe given there are some macro uncertainties out there. How long do you think that strengths continue? Chuck Kummeth : Yeah, we've had a nice two year run of double digit growth in Europe. And we kind of guided last quarter that we probably see ourselves, in the high single digit going forward, safely as we get bigger and we're kind of there this quarter although it's for more mix reasons, many I'll say I think. I don't think we're seeing any real issues with Brexit or economies faulting or funding going away in Europe. Our execution is still doing really well there. And our harmonization strategy with our within our divisions is building out full subsidiaries in these new countries that we're in and still building growth and the share we're taking so. So I think we're high single digits is very safe. I think for the short-term and I'm still hoping we can do better, but there are certainly risks in there - in the arrow and people are talking about fasting Europe a lot everybody seems to be, so we haven't seen as much as most, but we saw a little bit through this quarter obvious for the numbers. Catherine Schulte : Okay and then if I can sneak one more in on ACD, how should we think about the timeline and path forward for potential clinical tests using a ACD's platform? Chuck Kummeth : Well that's a hard one. We need partners for that and we're working with some. There's a lot of opportunity. If I had to focus on what we're going to put our regulatory and clinical strength and probably ExosomeDx to be honest right now, but we are focused on partners that have a lot of interest. There's a lot of people wanting to work with us. There's some I can't talk about. They want to stay hidden right now, but we have some newsworthy partnerships established already. And this is a great platform and it's a very different kind of biopsy and end of day you still need - you need tissue and there are a lot of tissue banks out there. There's a lot of work to be done with tissue and solid tumor is still an area of great concern for oncology, so we see a great future for this as a platform. And maybe we'll take more partnerships. We are not going to do all this on our own obviously. Catherine Schulte : Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Patrick Donnelly from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hey guys, good morning. This is Charlie on for Patrick. If I could just touch back on China, on the core agent side, I think you guys had talked in the past about picking up share for maybe some of the smaller players who don't really have the ability to scale that business. So can you kind of just help us tease out the runway for those share gains and maybe what you kind of use the market rate versus what share you are gaining? Chuck Kummeth : Yeah, it's a great question. I'm glad someone asked it. Lately we aren't talking enough about our about and our core is not going to the park lately and allowing us to do all these great acquisitions and fund the way we're funding them. But with antibodies over 20%, growth we're clearly taking share. We think as a market, antibodies is somewhere in the six to eight. It's a broad category obviously and it depends on what area you want to talk about antibodies, but as a holistic kind of market it's about that range. And we're sitting here at 20 - over 20% and we've been double digit for a while, so we know we are. On why are we, I think there's two reasons. One, I think the flight to quality, validated antibodies, GMP reagents, GP proteins is driving up a little guys a lot and as major players in the market are benefiting from this certainly and it's only going to get better. When you look at what's going to happen with GMP, needed to be in everything just two to three years out. We actually think we can move fast enough to scaling up more and more GMP equipment and getting beyond just our evolve because we think the world with the whole the whole Car-T, Biosimilar everything happening in immuno therapeutics, the demand is going to - the throttle point for all these therapies man of being the reagents, they seed this self. The other thing is our website. I mean, we have invested heavily in our website. And we had a good model. I mean, Abcam was10 years ahead of us, I mean, they had an exceptional website and they still do. But ours is pretty darn good now and we have got a broad portfolio, we can do near single point ordering in a lot of areas, we're working on that as well, so we can have a one basket approach. The amount of content we put it on online and you're getting with the antibodies, you got to have lots of pictures and lots of citation and a lot of data have got to go online to actually move vendor buyers because there's tens of thousands of them. And researchers are always in a quandary of what they need, what they're looking for. So you've got to have that content online. And we've been going after that for good five years now. And it helps, so we have a very big program on monitoring our digital metrics and our traffic on our website has been going up double digit, quarter and quarter for - it'd be three years now this July when we launched the first new website. So it's had a huge impact for us to increase our share we think, so those were two main issues I think and by the way we are - and the other part I guess would be great products. We are able to make products, in a lot of cases no others can make. This is hard science, we have the best portfolio, we have the tough stuff, so when researchers want to get the best quality and some cases we only skew that they know it can work they come to us , so that hasn't gone away either. Unidentified Analyst : Got it, thanks and then on the core diagnostic side, I think last quarter there was some lumpiness around timing there. Did that come back in the quarter and just trying to figure out like how we should marry that with the back half of the year? Chuck Kummeth : Yeah, always lumpy and it will be for a while. But yeah, it did recover pretty well. It had tough comp for moisture too, yeah, I realized that, but it was modest, decent growth and again we see a better second half. We are seeing often these new programs, the pipeline I've been talking about these last few quarters are starting to hit and that'll only get better. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Drew Jones, Stephens Incorporated. Please go ahead. Drew Jones : Thanks. Chuck, you just talked about the favorable backdrop for your reagent business on the demand side. Can you talk a little bit about the pricing trends and whether the increased demand for GMP and validated product maybe gives you a little more leeway on price there? Chuck Kummeth : In a fact it does. GMP related products are roughly 30% higher in price and we're not the lowest cost of product in town anyway. So researchers will pay for quality. When you're talking about GMB grade for production and for finishing out clinical and whatever they're okay with paying it. In terms of price overall, we've had a decent price here, we're 1 ish or so percent little better on price. So we have the metrics, the systems in place and actually know how to monitor price. We didn't have that two, three years ago. And so we're able to now build it into our strategies. All of us in this team come from large companies who are used to having very strict pricing strategies and tools to work on price and just used to it. So we're finally in a place where we can now do what we know how to do and that's part of the game. So if you see us at 10% in our agents business, you can count on 1% being on price whereas four or five years ago we would have been 8% or 9% because we would have known anything well price and probably wouldn't have had any price, so that's part of it. Now market conditions change all this of course, but that's kind of current state of affairs and with decent funding in our industry and I think everyone's probably prescribing to that kind of the goal I think. Drew Jones : Got it and then jumping over to EPI, I just want to make sure I heard that right. Physician uptick doubled sequentially. Is that right? And if so, where was the incremental domain coming from? Was it existing practices, Greenfield docs, just a little bit of color on that? Chuck Kummeth : The double uptick was on the kit request. And we're at about - we're public on about 1100 or so urologists, which we think is roughly 10%. So we're just starting to get calm, really. In terms of the test uptick, it's more like 40% and we're going to be - we hopefully - that's without NCCN guidelines. So how that goes forward, hopefully up, but this is step one for an increase. And then step two, of course is Medicare. So for a good growth rate about probably all we can really assume right now is all the other issues that got deal with. Drew Jones : Thanks, guys. Chuck Kummeth : Remember, this is an LDP model. So if we're growing 40%, 50% a quarter, we got to do 40% to 50% more tests in our lab. So it's a lot of scaling up you got to doing this model. It isn't just selling. Operator : Our next question comes from Dan Leonard from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Dan Leonard : Thank you, just a few perhaps quick ones here. First off, on the on the reagents business or the protein sciences business overall, are you taking any of the performance and upside and investing triggering any investment to support future growth or upside there really going to fund the diagnostics business that's my first question? Chuck Kummeth : Well, we don't. We are a company and not a set of companies, so it all goes in a strategic pool. Those are fund waiting, they need to fund, but I will make a common and turns in investments for the core business and for Protein Sciences. It's all about GMP my friends. And we are investing at about a double the rate in capital we have been in terms which isn't a lot by the way for this company, but in terms of a business, but it is going up because we see the potential in GMP gain proteins and reagents to be really, really big going forward mainly to support our cell therapy business and we're going to have a news coming out soon. We're building more and more around this model on large cell therapy abilities and it's going to be no less as exciting as ACD and ExosomeDx has been in my opinion, so another quarter or two and then hopefully we'll be talking about that more. We're getting ready, I'm not kidding and you look at the numbers of what Car-T and cell therapies are going to be in terms of a market. It's unbelievable and there's - no one's ready for it. There are so many clinical going on and how they're going to get the stuff they need to actually be in production for these therapies. We all got to get going now, so there's a lot to go after. Lead times in some of these big pieces of equipment for mentors, lyophilizers are - can be a year to two years because they're almost all custom a little bit and I can tell you we're on it. Dan Leonard : That's helpful color. And then my second question on ACD. So the past of getting back to double digit growth is that more of a fiscal 2020 event, given that the comparisons in the second half of '19 are still not easy or you could get there after the year. Chuck Kummeth : No, this quarter. This quarter is going to happen. We're finishing up integration. We didn't really start integration until this milestone and now single is over. There's one thing I learned in this. We gave these guys an 18 month turnout because of only 18 months we left them largely alone. We didn't start integrating as soon as we should have and we spent this whole you're integrating, so a few of them left with their money. Of course the leader we knew was going to leave. We brought in a fantastic new team and leadership team and working on stuff and a lot of Q1 comments are still there as well of course, head of commercial is still, a fabulous person and it's just about getting back on it. I can't tell you. Acquisitions or acquisitions and they're all different and they all hit a one year bump I Think when you start integrating and we're finishing we're getting to the end of that bump and I'm hoping that will be a double digit growth starting this quarter going forward here safely and then ramp from there. Dan Leonard : And final clarification on EPI, have you already submitted your request for reconsideration to NGS for their LCD or is that something you expect to do in the coming weeks or months? Chuck Kummeth : I think we submitted, resubmitted and resubmitted. I think to delay off the NCCN and I got to find out from Tom just what version we're at with the NGS. They're well aware of it, I know that. So the process is ongoing. We're in the process for that to happen. So I kind of believe that we have anything waiting around to be filed or what? Jim Hippel : There's communication with NGS that day. Chuck Kummeth : Yeah, exactly. Dan Leonard : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Alex Nowak from Craig-Hallum Capital Group. Please go ahead. Alex Nowak : Great, good morning, everyone, so Chuck, just staying on the cell and gene therapy side of the business do you need to make any additional acquisitions there to round out that prior portfolio? Or do you think you have everything you need? And now you just need to build everything out internally there? Chuck Kummeth : It's a good question and very insightful. We've been public about \u2013we're probably not looking for any new platform like an ExosomeDx or an ACD, but we are still rounding out. We think it's a fantastic potential workflow that collectively together could be just as big or bigger than an ExosomeDx as a platform. I think we're probably one or two small acquisitions away of filling out that works full circle. As you know, we've got the Ella platform. We've got GMP proteins we've got the Cloudz, these - we don't have bioreactors. We have a partnership in place. We don't have gene editing, but we have a partnership in place, so there's some things we're still looking at to do that and I would - I can't promise you acquisitions, but that is certainly where we're hunting and given our history, it's probably likely we're going to get something. Alex Nowak : Okay. I understand and then maybe just outside of the cell and gene therapy side, how do you think about M&A going back into calendar 2019 year and do you think you've reached a point where you like to go back out and acquire maybe some larger businesses or you still going to stay more in the bolt-on side? Chuck Kummeth : We're in the bolt-on site especially for now. I think given that we're a year later on finishing integration on ACD which I just explained and I want to get that really off and running safely. And then we're right in the middle on ExosomeDx, so these are some big nuts that we paid a lot of money for we got to get right. Our board wants to make sure we get them right. We can strap on these little bolt-ons, no problem without a lot of work like black Cloudz was in Atlanta and things it's not an issue and we'll continue that and be optimistic. Frank Mortari is a busy guy here, looking to deal for us and we still have a pipeline well over hundred, we're participating in a couple right now and we'll see what happens, but probably nothing large. We're at two times leverage ending date Jim, right. So we've got some powder if we need it, but something's came to a process that we really want to see and if they - even though we're not really ready and we wouldn't like seen a process, they came to a process we participate, but we don't you don't do well on in public processes anyway. So I never say never, but it's largely going to be small bolt on's this year I think and hopefully a few, we'll see. Alex Nowak : Okay, that's helpful and then I know few others have touched on this, but just on the protein platforms business, this thing just continues to be on fire. So Chuck, what inning are we at right now with that business. I'm just trying to figure out how much longer can we grow at this sort of rate? Chuck Kummeth : If you're going back to the 15% number for sure people are trying to squeeze us to say 20. We've been at 20, I think it's going to be 15 to 20 for years. Western blot, we're still at 10% market share for growing 10%, we're finally hitting stride there's a long way to go. Biologics is safe. In SimplePlex I don't even know what to tell you. This thing can go to so many markets. It could even be in point of care this micropoint deal alone in China could be $100 million deal. We got to wait two years for clinical be done, but can you imagine the size of doing patient monitoring across all the China for cytokines storm for all their stem cell therapies. This is the company led by a guy who did mind ray over there. So we're really impressed with him and his team. He's extremely well connected. He knows he's doing his panels were great he's already wanting more panels for more things going with us and this is just one area in a different country. We've been started doing stuff here, so we have a lot of different cartridge stripes on the drawing board here around the Ella platform and I think it's going to be amazing if you look out five, ten years. Alex Nowak : Understood, thank you very helpful. Operator : We'll now take our final question from Paul Knight from Janney Montgomery. Please go ahead Unidentified Analyst : Hi guys this is actually Casey on for Paul. We want to know what were the standout instruments in the protein simple part of your business? Chuck Kummeth : Almost all of them, everything, but - so we have in [indiscernible], those two were okay, but not as strong as the other bigger ones. The biggest standout is been the western blot and western jess and jess was two thirds that after the sale, so we're letting up probably right now because there's such demand for this new instrument jess which is the big brother to west. This allows us also do things the west to go more academic where there's more pricing pressure and stuff so it's always tries a strategies work very well. And then biologics is really come back pretty well and that's also been a 20% grower. So and then Ella, Ella has been growing between 50% and 100% every quarter for the last couple years. So I just mentioned enough on that. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, great and then one final question. And Q3 coming up, will you guys see any effect from the government shutdown as far as government spending? Chuck Kummeth : Yeah, I asked that. I got questions out to my teams and commercial have no one thinks so. I was little more concerned about the cold weather last week and all the schools and array shutting down, but not hearing anything yet. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, great. Thanks, guys. Operator : As there are no further questions from the phone, I'll now turn the call back to your host for any additional or closing remarks. Chuck Kummeth : Okay. Well thanks everybody for listening. We had a record number of people online too for this, so really happy for that. It was a great quarter and we hope to deliver another one next quarter. So talk to you then. Thank you. Operator : That will conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation ladies and gentlemen. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to Bio-Techne Earnings Conference Call for the third quarter of fiscal year 2019. [Operator Instructions]. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jim Hippel, Bio-Techne's Chief Financial Officer. James Hippel : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me this morning is Chuck Kummeth, Chief Executive Officer of Bio-Techne. Before we begin, let me briefly cover our safe harbor statement. Some of the comments made during this conference call may be considered forward-looking statements, including beliefs and expectations about the company's future results. The company's 10-K for fiscal year 2018 and other SEC filings identifies certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements made during this call. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of any new information or future events or developments. The 10-K as well as the company's other SEC filings are available on the company's website within its Investor Relations section. During the call, non-GAAP financial measures may be used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. Tables reconciling these measures to most comparable GAAP results are available in the company's press release issued earlier this morning on the Bio-Techne Corporation website at www.bio-techne.com. With that, I'll turn the call over to Chuck. Charles Kummeth : Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter conference call. Our fiscal Q3 was a record quarter for Bio-Techne, and I'm extremely pleased with the execution of our plan so far this year. The company delivered 14% organic growth in the quarter with both of our reporting segments growing double-digit. We're performing at levels that we were envisioning just a few years ago. Our acquisitions over this time are integrating well and providing extra organic growth to our ever-improving core reagent businesses. Standouts included our ProteinSimple franchise, which continue to grow north of 25%. Our genomics division, which return to double-digit growth in a big way, also growing north of 25%, while our core antibody business grew north of 15% in the quarter. As we look at our performance by geography, all major regions continued to perform exceedingly well with growth at least in the teens for the quarter. China as we've come to expect were the fastest with growth over 20% in Q3. I'm even more pleased with the continued consistency of our growth rates of the company over the past several quarters. I believe it speaks to the strength of our product portfolio, the scalable market these products addressed and the momentum behind the fine execution of our strategic plan.  So now let's talk a bit more about the performance of our products starting with the Protein Sciences segment. We experienced double-digit growth in nearly every single product category. Our instrument business solutions continue to see great acceptance in the market with our automated Western blot solution growing over 40% in Q3 and 35% year-to-date. The biologic iCE platform grew nearly 20% in the quarter and our automated ELISA solution, Ella, grew over 50%. Growth in the Protein Sciences segment also benefited from continued strength in our core reagents, especially in antibodies and cell and gene therapy application. In antibodies, we continue to achieve double-digit growth by focusing on validation and reproducibility, adding more content to our website in support of our antibodies, constant Search Engine Optimization to derive researches to our website.  And of course, continue developing new antibodies that our customers desire. Also, the high quality of our antibodies is being recognized more and more by developers of therapeutics who see the potential of our vast LIBOR of antibodies has towards development next-generation immune therapies. For example, we announced last week that Bio-Techne entered into a strategic collaboration for the development of anticancer therapeutics with Elpiscience BioPharma. As part of the collaboration, Elpiscience will have access to multiple antibodies from Bio-Techne's extensive product portfolio for use in the development of preclinical, clinical and commercial biopharmaceuticals to address unmet medical needs in oncology.  Bio-Techne solutions for the cell and gene therapy workflow, which grew 30% during the quarter span across our product portfolio and include GMP cytokines and growth factors, GMP small molecules, GMP media and high-quality antibodies for flow cytometry and immunocytochemical characterization. The use of GMP reagents early in the manufacturing process is highly advantageous as it eases the cell therapy workflow transition from bench to clinic by preventing the need to switch to GMP at a later stage when the cost and risk of change is higher and the freedom of change is lower. While cell and gene therapy applications are currently a relatively small portion of our reagents business today, with over 1,000 cell therapies and clinical trials already, the need for GMP-grade reagents in the coming years is going to accelerate dramatically. As the world leader in proteins for over 40 years, Bio-Techne plans to be ready to meet that need. We will be investing nearly $40 million in capital over the next 12 months on a new GMP factory being built in Minneapolis.  This factory will have the capacity to deliver annually over $200 million worth of GMP reagents to cell and gene therapy customers. We expect to be producing at least half of that annual capacity within the next 5 years. In addition, Bio-Techne is focused on developing innovative and technological pioneering solutions that optimize and simplify cell therapy manufacturing with Cloudz trademark cell activation kits and the SimplePlex immunoassays. These technologies are designed to expedite cell expansion and improve product quality control, respectively. We at Bio-Techne are excited to lead the way in the production of innovative GMP reagents in the highly technical solutions for cell therapy developing -- development and manufacturing worldwide.  Moving on to our Diagnostics and Genomics segment, where we had solid double-digit growth in Q3. As I mentioned in my opening comments, the big story here is the return to strong growth for our genomics division. With the tough earn-out comps behind us and the integration of the new leadership and strategy is nearly complete, the team has reinvigorated and the results show it. Our customers have also expressed their continued excitement for the advanced cell diagnostics brand and its RNAscope platform in the form of the CiteAb Awards, which celebrates the very best suppliers and individuals in the research sector worldwide. Bio-Techne's ACD brand received the researchers' choice award, which recognizes the reagents supplier that researchers were most impressed with throughout 2018. Excellent product quality, customer service and innovation for our RNAscope platform were highlighted as reasons for receiving the award. One nomination for ACD stated that RNAscope is absolutely unparalleled in the industry at the moment for the visualization of RNA in tissues and cells. Dr. Andrew Chalmers, founder of CiteAb, said, \"CiteAb had nominations in this category for ACD from all around the world, and each outlines the excellent quality of products and customer service. Many of the nominations highlighted particular members of staff at ACD that had made working with the company easier for researchers.\" We at Bio-Techne already knew that RNAscope is a great product, but it is this comment about our people who support ACD's customers that makes me most proud.  Another demonstration of our customers enthusiasm for ACD technology is the recent strategic cooperation agreement with Lisen Imprinting Diagnostics. A Chinese high-tech company that develops diagnostics assays and services protected by multiple domestic and international patents. Lisen Imprinting Diagnostics has independently developed several diagnostics methods for the oncology field that can detect changes in the early stages of tumor progression more accurately and provide precise personalized cancer diagnosis for patients. We are thrilled to be collaborating with Lisen to advance the use of the RNAscope platform for China's precision diagnostics initiatives, which will help the 2 sides to accelerate the development of molecular diagnostics in the Chinese market and to generally promote the benefits of precision medicine as a result of more accurate diagnostics. The enthusiasm for ACD's technology goes beyond our customers and is also recognized by other life science tools companies. For example, Bio-Techne is partnering with NanoString Technologies to accelerate the development of new tools for spatial genomics. The combined workflow that unites the RNAscope reagent portfolio from Bio-Techne with NanoString's GeoMx RNA assays, enables researchers to molecularly guide their high-plex spatial analysis with single cell resolution. The combination will be the basis of an ongoing partnership, which is aimed at further integration of these platforms into one concise workflow, extending spatial genomics applications from basic research to translational and clinical applications. This partnership provides researchers with the most complete and integrated solution available for RNA biomarkers and we are excited to be working with the NanoString team on this collaboration. Finally, an update on Exosome Diagnostics.  As we discussed during our last call, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network or NCCN, decided at the very end of January to include EPI as a recommended test in their clinical practice guidelines in oncology for prostate cancer early detection. The updated treatment algorithm includes EPI testing prior to a first prostate biopsy or after a negative biopsy to assist patients and urologists in further finding the probability of high-grade cancer and in reaching a joint decision to either proceed with the prostate biopsy or continue monitoring. The NCCN guidelines are recognized clinical standards for cancer care by clinicians and payers in United States. The guidelines are developed and revised by a panel of expert physicians from 28 leading U.S. cancer centers. The panel revises recommended practice guidelines according to current clinical evidence and advances in cancer cure. Since the inclusion of the EPI test into the NCCN guidelines, EPI has continued to gain acceptance among urologists throughout the country. Over 4,600 patient tests were performed in Q3, a 14% increase over Q2.  For more than 1,600 ordering physicians, this level of enthusiasm by the urology community and now with the NCCN guideline inclusion continues to give us confidence that EPI will be added to the NGS local coverage determination for Medicare reimbursement. The next steps for Medicare coverage as we understand it will be an open meeting by the NGS in June with decisions determine during that meeting implemented by CMS before the end of the September quarter. An agenda for the June meeting should be made public sometime in May, we expect to be on the agenda for June. With regards to non-Medicare payers, the Exosome team continues to make progress of payer coverage. They have contracted with 25 regional, commercial and PPO networks nationwide and have Medicaid rolled out into over 30 states. The next big gating item that will enable us to contract with large nationwide insurance payers is to receive New York state certification of our CLIA lab in Massachusetts. New York state requires its own certification for an LCD test can be administered to a patient who resides there. Given the big population in the state, large national carriers will generally not consider reimbursement for a test not certified by the state of New York.  Our lab in Waltham is scheduled for a New York state audit in the month of May. We expect to pass the audit with certification by the state of New York to quickly follow. EPI is the first diagnostic test of many using both urine and blood derived exosomes that we will seek approval for over the coming years. Our Exosome-driven Diagnostics platform is unique in liquid biopsy field and position to become a true standard of care for diagnosing, treating and monitoring cancer as well as other diseases. Our diagnostic products will enable physicians to take a more targeted and precise approach in their treatment strategies and thus improve patient outcomes while lowering overall health care costs.  Before turning the call over to Jim, I would like to conclude my prepared remarks with a comment about our adjusted operating margin performance. While we experience a 280 basis point year-on-year decline to adjusted operating margin in Q3, due to the acquisitions of Exosome Diagnostics earlier this year, I'm very pleased to report that excluding this acquisition, our adjusted operating margin for the quarter grew 190 basis points year-over-year and hit 40% of sales. This is 2 years earlier than the 5-year financial guidance we gave at our very first Investors Day back in September 2016. This achievement demonstrates our commitment to holding our historically strong core margins while ramping profitably in the businesses we've acquired over the past 5 years. I am absolutely delighted with the results so far this year, which sets us up for the potential for the first full fiscal year of double-digit organic growth at Bio-Techne. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim. James Hippel : Thanks, Chuck. I'll provide an overview of our Q3 financial performance for the total company as well as provide some color on each of our segments. Starting with the overall third quarter financial performance. Adjusted EPS was flat prior year at $1.21 with foreign exchange negatively impacting EPS by $0.10 or 8%. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $1.15, compared to $0.52 in the prior year. Q3 reported revenue was $184.9 million, an increase of 13% year-over-year, with organic revenue increasing 14%. Third quarter reported sales included a 1% growth contribution from acquisitions and a 2% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange translation. By geography, the U.S. grew in the mid-teens, Europe's organic growth was in the low teens, while China grew over 20%. As for the rest of Asia, organic growth was in the low teens led by South Korea and India, the latter growing nearly 100%. High-end market, which excludes Asia and our diagnostics division, biopharma growth was in the mid-teens while academic sales growth was in the mid-single-digit. Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin was down 70 basis points compared to the prior year at 71.3% in Q3, with favorable product mix and operational productivity more than offset by the acquisition of Exosome Diagnostics and foreign currency headwinds. Adjusted SG&A in Q3 was 27.7% of revenue, down 150 basis points from Q2, and 230 basis points higher than the prior year. The volume leverage was more than offset by the additional SG&A added as a result of the Exosome Diagnostics acquisition. R&D expense in Q3 was 8.4% of revenue, relatively flat to the prior year. The resulting adjusted operating margin for Q3 was 35.2%, that's a 270 basis points increase sequentially over Q2, and a decrease of 208 basis points from the prior year period. However, as Chuck already mentioned, excluding the impact from recent acquisition, core adjusted operating margin expanded 190 basis points year-over-year. This was driven by strong volume leverage, favorable product mix and solid operational productivity partially offset by foreign exchange headwinds.  Looking at our numbers below operating income, net interest expense in Q3 was $4.9 million, compared to $2.3 million of net interest expense last year. The higher interest expense is driven by a higher debt level that resulted from our acquisition of Exosome Diagnostics in Q1 as well as multiple LIBOR rate increases in the past year on our outstanding line of credit. Our bank debt on the balance sheet as of the end of Q3 stood at $522.3 million, down from $545.5 million at the end of Q2. Our adjusted nonoperating expense for the quarter was $1.5 million compared to $0.5 million of other income from the prior year due to unfavorable transactional foreign exchange. For GAAP reporting, other nonoperating includes a $12.3 million unrealized gain from our investment team in ChemoCentryx, compared to a $16.2 million unrealized loss last year that was due to an impairment charge in our since disposed investment in Astute. The unrealized gain in ChemoCentryx is due to the adoption of accounting standard update 2016-01, recognition in measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities, which requires equity investments with readily available fair market values to be recorded on asset on the balance sheet and any changes in fair value to be recorded on the income statement. The prior standard, as reported last year, required changes in fair market value to be recorded in the equity section of the balance sheet.  Moving on down to P&L. Our adjusted effective tax rate in Q3 was 19.9%, a 410 basis point improvement from the prior year due to tax reform. Turning to cash flow and return to capital, $39.7 million of cash was generated from operations in the third quarter and our net investment in capital expenditures was $4.9 million. $12.1 million of dividends were paid out in the quarter and average diluted shares stood at 38.9 million shares outstanding. Now I'll discuss the performance of our reporting segments, starting with the Protein Sciences segment. Q3 reported sales were $137.9 million with reported revenue increasing 12%. Organic growth was 15% with foreign exchange unfavorably impacting growth by 3%. As Chuck has already described, the growth in this segment was very broad in almost every product category and geographic region. Operating margin for the Protein Sciences segment was 45.1%, an increase of 140 basis points year-over-year due to strong volume leverage and operational productivity, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange. Strong margin expansion was experienced in both our reagent and instrument portfolios.  Turning to the Diagnostics and Genomics segment, Q3 reported sales were $47.1 million, an increase of 15% from the prior year. Organically, revenues grew to 13% with a 3% growth contribution from acquisitions and a 1% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange translation. As Chuck previously described, growth in this segment was led by our genomics business. However, our diagnostics OEM business also contributed with growth in the upper single digits due to favorable order timing this quarter. With regards to Exosome Diagnostics and as I've stated on prior calls, revenues from EPI test performed is being recognized on a cash basis. This is the correct accounting treatment, given its recent commercial launch in 2018. For patients insured by private payers, the cycle from test report date to payment can be quite long. This is especially true for patients covered by PPO. For patients insured by Medicare, payment is pending the decision made by NGS and CMS on reimbursement. With Medicare approval still pending and given that the majority of our private payer contracts are currently with PPOs, very little of the tests performed since the Exosome Diagnostics acquisition date were collected before the end of March. Thus, the revenue from EPI recorded in our Q3 results was rather minimal and we will be continuing to focus our dialogue on current test trends, private payer contract coverage and public reimbursement decision knowing that revenue recognition will lag. Moving on to operating margins for the Diagnostics and Geonomics segment. At 7.6% the segment's operating margin was substantially lower than the prior year. However, excluding the dilution from the Exosome Diagnostics acquisition, operating margin for the segment was 23.9% or 30 basis points better than last year. The organic margin improvement was largely due to volume leverage.  In summary for the quarter, our breadth of growth continues to be solid both in terms of end markets and product categories. Having 3 quarters in a row of double-digit organic growth also speaks to the positive momentum in our commercial execution. We feel good about fiscal year '19 possibly being our first full fiscal year of double-digit organic growth at Bio-Techne. With at least 10% growth in all of our businesses, except diagnostics OEM, which will likely be flat for the year. On the bottom line, our overall adjusted operating margin performance continues to be in line with what we expected at the beginning of the fiscal year albeit achieved a bit differently. Obviously, the delay of Medicare reimbursement has increased the impact of Exosome Diagnostics dilution to our earnings from what we anticipated at the beginning of the fiscal year. However, the stellar operational performance in our core business is mitigating most fourth this additional dilution and we expect this trend to continue as we finish the year. That concludes my prepared comments. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Aaron to open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And we'll go first to Puneet Souda with SVB Leerink. Puneet Souda : Maybe first on improvement in ACD and RNAscope business. What's your expectation here going forward for the rest of the year? And maybe now with the business reorganized and operating under new leadership, what your expectation maybe into the next couple of quarters? Charles Kummeth : Sure. Well, it's the same question we got last quarter. And we said we kind of guided that we'd probably be hopefully back in the teens this quarter with our goal to be going into the next fiscal year in 20% or better. It was really nice to be above 25% this quarter and going forward, we do see 20% or better. Maybe more, we'll know more probably within the coming quarter. We're still kind of scaling all back here with Kim's leadership and few new people and a few replacements and Europe turning back on. We did some integration down there. So I mean, all in all, it's going quite well. China has starting to already lift, we've add some resource there as well Japan, so. Our goal was 30%. We'd be happy with 20-plus as we talked about for this -- for going forward for a while here for you said a couple of quarters, but I'm hoping for better. Puneet Souda : Okay. Great. Charles Kummeth : The demand has never been better. I mean the agreement with Lisen is a good example, we're getting a lot of requests for collaborations. NanoString is another one, so there's never been better demand. So it's really kind of up to us in execution, I think, to really reachieve 25-plus percent. Puneet Souda : Okay. Great. And I had a quite broader question in terms of the GMP proteins and the focus you have in building out the capabilities there around cell therapies and other types of products potentially. We saw quite a bit of M&A activity here. I mean GE BioPharma, the Brammer and, I mean, the recent small acquisition of the protein analytical technologies. So maybe just give us your view -- has your view changed at all in terms of how you're looking at the space in terms of acquisitions? And just overall, broadly around the workflow that you want to develop for the GMP proteins and the capabilities around that portfolio. Charles Kummeth : Well, we feel very strong about it. We know for sure that this is a chance to maybe possibly even double our protein business over the next 5 years just with the onslaught of all the need for GMPs. So instead of being a mile wide and inch deep in research, we're going to be much broader and with things that are more scalable. A lot fewer SKUs but bigger scale so they're in the need for the new factories, so we have bigger everything and of course, it's GMPs so it has to be very, very auditable and confined and high integrity. And so we can do all that. We do it now, just we do it at a much lower scalable level. In terms of the industry and what we saw, I mean, we start talking about this well over a year ago. And I guess it makes me feel better to see the Brammers being picked up by the Thermos. Another, just kind of indicates that we're all on the right path, I think. There's clearly a lot of potential. When we start reading the fun facts about there's a thousand different therapeutics and clinicals, my God, it's, I think, we may end up being throttled 3 to 5 years out by the lack of GMP, proteins, reagents and all the things that people may not be taking into consideration that you've got to have to get this -- these therapies to market. So we're going for it and it's not a ton of capital for this large size company. We don't spend a lot of capital anyway, so it's a very prudent investment and we think the payback will be absolutely huge. Puneet Souda : Okay. And last one if I could touch on protein platforms overall. You obviously have delivered strong growth here. As we look forward, obviously the comps are going to get tougher. Maybe just give us a view into how you're -- sort of where the penetration strands currently into the broader sort of the market for Ella and Wes and the overall technologies that you have. Maybe just give us a sense where you stand currently and that should comps be a challenge here or do you see a further growth coming onboard as the penetration is still low? Charles Kummeth : Well, starting probably two years ago, we were always guiding that this is going to be an asset that 5% to 15% or so kind of organic growth, which is really fantastic, especially for us back then with mid-single-digit growth everywhere else. We have probably concluded 9 out of 12, 10, and something like last quarters of 20%-plus and we're still right up there. It's been really a delight to see the Wes and Jess platform, the Western blot platform exceed 40% organic growth. We've been hoping for 20%, and we keep exceeding it. It's been 30% for quarters in a row here. So getting to 40%. And yet another 100 system quarter here for Wes and Jess is another nice feat for us.  So we're definitely starting to hit the mainstream and yet we still think we're probably 10% or less in terms of the market share. So we've got a long way to go there. iCE has recovered nicely. iCE is never going to be probably a 40% grower, but if we can keep it in that mid-teens to 20% growth, it's very solid, very good for us, it's still a big business. It's then lapped now by the Western blot business of that portfolio but it's still sizable. And then don't count out Ella. I mean this is now a very, very important business for us. It's -- it matters and is growing at 50% plus just shows that the great demand for it, it's a great technology. We keep hearing about new applications and new opportunities every week for it. So we're expecting big things from it for a long time yet to come. So going forward, ASD is the new division name. We do see this and this is with assays. So all in, we do see this as a 20 -- way more than 20% grower for the foreseeable future. Puneet Souda : Great. Congrats, guys. Charles Kummeth : On the proteins simple part of it. Assays have been so strong lately, it's hard to know where we're going to end up, but we had an excellent quarter in Assays. All in assays with the multiplexing, with Luminex, we're a 14% grower there as well. So this is just what we exactly wanted. This includes our ELISA. We're worried about ELISA going away, but the whole portfolio growing double-digit quarter-after-quarter is exactly what our strategy was. So that does bring the total ASD a little bit. It's still going to be an awful nice double-digit number. Operator : We'll go next to Catherine Schulte with Baird. Catherine Schulte : Just curious if you can talk about the path forward for additional test on exosome platform. Any update on when we could see clinical trials for bladder or kidney rejection? Charles Kummeth : I say, imminent on bladder. I believe we're actually working on getting patients going with different partners in that samples and such. So we do expect, call it about two years from today, we should be in the same spot we are today with EPI, hopefully. And we're going to follow the same kind of LDT strategy. That said, we can't do everything in parallel here. We're probably more open for business than the previous administration of that company in terms of partnering. So we have a lot of interest and certainly on the kidney rejection as well as the blood versions of the technology platform, most likely a first indications for lung and for breast. And we keep pounding forward on our clinical diagnostics part of the business as well. Most of our revenues right now is around that. So we have many, many big pharma paying us money for access and doing validation network right now. So we're really expecting this to be a big platform. It's going to be 3- to 5- to 10-year kind of a future here, especially for the clinical diagnostics piece of it, which will all pay off eventually. First things bladder, it's happening now, so. Catherine Schulte : Great. And then on the Elpiscience BioPharma agreement. How should we think about economics on this type of collaboration? And should we expect to see more of these therapeutic partnerships going forward? Charles Kummeth : Yes, I'd classify this and it's really it's shot on goal. It's not as important or material as probably, potentially, as the Micropoint deal with Ella. But if they hit with these and they have access to some very important antibodies of ours and if the work pays off for them, they'll be doing therapeutics with these in China, which are going to be big scale of businesses. We'll receive different rights, royalties and things from that. It'll take some time for it to get to that, but that's why it's nothing imminent there for payback but there is -- there are access revenue piece. So there's milestones and such but the big payout is later when the things hit. And it could be tens of millions of dollars if they hit. So we're couple of years away from really knowing where those end up. I'd like 10 more of these. These are shot-on-goal kind of opportunities. They don't really cost us a lot, there's not a lot of resource needed, it's just really providing our great products to them for their research. Catherine Schulte : Great. And then last one for me. You had strong results once again in Europe better than what we've seen from some of your peers. So just curious what you're seeing there. Are you seeing any stocking ahead of a potential Brexit? Charles Kummeth : No. Not at all. We're all biting our nails here for this quarter with Europe. Everybody else posting doom and gloom over there. But once again, we kind came through with some pretty good numbers and pretty good results. I don't think they're at the -- they're not quite as high as they've been, but they're just under and they're very solid for us and we see it continuing more or less. I think the collaboration us selling full solutions, expanding our commercial field across all of Europe, leveraging the small distributor acquisitions we made. We're still in the mid-innings on all that leverage of it, say. So it's going quite well. And on Brexit, we just don't see any impact. We didn't see an impact when there was going to be a Brexit, let alone now when there's probably not going to be a Brexit. Operator : We'll take our next question from Michael Sarcone with Deutsche Bank. Michael Sarcone : This is Mike Sarcone on for Dan Leonard. So first one just on ACD. Can you just speak to how you guys are thinking about both or where you stand today in terms of research market penetration? And then maybe how you're thinking about clinical market penetration and the timing there? Charles Kummeth : Yes. Well, it's kind of hard for us to guess the clinical market, it's not really our thing. So we're certainly open for business in partnering and working with a lot of different office like this Lisen who hopefully will have great success. The research side, I think we're moderately penetrated. I mean the very first inning of this technology were for the researchers who want to do work and didn't have an antibody, right? So you go needed to go molecular without an antibody in mind. That said, this has always been a tool, we bought this asset ready for the migration of iCE and -- for pathologists into the molecular space and we're working with automation providers and different tool providers to try and do that and provide better tools for standard everyday pathology along with the therapeutic potential, which there is a lot of potential. So we think this is a big platform. We're nowhere near where we think this is going to end up being in terms of maturity or saturation. Like I said in my earlier comment, we just -- we expect this to be a 30% grower. We're not back to that yet but we have plans to hopefully get there but certainly 20 or better and we'll keep making changes here until we get that because the potential is amazing. We really have a demand -- we have more demand than we have team that work on ideas. The idea -- the requests coming in from customers and research institutions and send KOLs and therapeutics is more than we can handle. So it's a matter of prioritizing this and then getting back in the game to get the growth going, so. Michael Sarcone : Got it. And can you maybe then speak to how do you think the NanoString partnership impacts that growth trajectory? Do you know maybe any way to frame the revenue opportunity from the NanoString partnership? Charles Kummeth : Well, I think it's probably more up to Brad and that team than us. I mean they really -- Brad and I got together on this really a couple of years ago. And initially, our teams were a little bit hesitant and -- but when we got them together, they started seeing the light of it. There really is a natural link up. We -- our technology kind of comes after the spatial front end of the research they do with their solutions. And I -- we think there's a lot of upside here. NanoString has potential and we'll ride with that and vice versa. So right now, it's kind of early to say and it's just again, it's another highly prioritized project that we're doing within the genomics business unit of more than we can handle, but it's right up there on priority. We think the world of that team and I think the -- we think it's great science. The instrument is wonderful and we know it works. So we're trying to make it all work altogether. Michael Sarcone : Got it. That's helpful. And last one for me, can you maybe just elaborate a little more on what you're seeing in the academic and government end markets, maybe in the major geographies? Charles Kummeth : Yes, we're pretty even with biopharma in Europe. It's was a little softer academia here in the U.S. But I think it's more about timing. I think we've got a little bit of some lumpiness and we watched the NIH funding every month, we get the reports and that's been a little bit up and down. In general, I would say going forward, we see mid-single-digit levels are better with academia and we will stay around the high single-digit to low double-digit in biopharma is what we kind of see. Operator : We'll take our next question from Patrick Donnelly with Goldman Sachs. Charles Steinman : This is Charlie on for Patrick. One on exo. I think you mentioned that the test line was being up 14% quarter-over-quarter, which I think is a decel relative to last quarter, which is I think a little surprising to us seeing as you did get NCCN coming online in January. So can you just talk to how that threaded against your model and the puts and takes that you're seeing on the commercial side? Charles Kummeth : Yes. We noted the number at 4,600 tests. We actually shipped over 5,000. This quarter we see between 6,000 and 7,000. It's kind of up and down a little bit and we have, as you know, a new team, new team leader. We've made a lot of changes and there's been some impact, but there's a lot of timing involved in some of this really. And with that also, there's some seasonality with regards also to the business with. At end of the year -- I should say, at the beginning of the calendar year is when most high deductible plan kicked back in and so you get much more activity towards the end of the year before people have to start using their deductibles again. So seasonality wise, the March quarter is typically the lowest quarters of the year. That being said, our March growth rate versus our -- March growth over our January growth was almost closer to 30%. We did almost 2,000 tests in March. So we're expecting 6,500 or better here for this quarter so with that on top of 4,600 is a pretty big increase. Again, it doesn't step up though until Medicare, right? So having that kind of growth without Medicare we think is wonderful, so. Charles Steinman : Noted. So just want to pivot to the cell and gene therapy side again. Can you give us an update on the Quad Tech acquisition? admittedly, gets less air time than Exo. But obviously sits on a market that's really gaining a lot of momentum right now. So can you give us your updated thoughts on where you see Quad fitting within your portfolio and within the broader market, both now and kind of in the future and any update to Quad on any potential synergies there? Charles Kummeth : Well, we talked probably a bit about the whole cell and gene therapy initiative here we're doing and we're putting, spend some money. But we're trying to build out this whole workflow and that includes the selection activation component which is the quad B technology along with the GMP proteins, along with immunoassay technology of Ella and we are working on some bioreactor as well as other components, gene editing components for the workflow. So we'll be, hopefully, announcing more things soon. That going -- that said, we're trying to get this initiative going into different clinics going as we can. So Quad's involved in quite a few clinicals. All our revenue right now of them is really clinical revenues, so it's going to take a little while. This is -- if you look at we've got our core paying the bills today.  We've got ACD ramping, we've got our ASD technology platform also paying the bills and ramping nicely. Exo is really kind of this year and next year starts ramping, but to 2 to 3 years out, that's when you're going to see the cell and gene therapy portfolio start hitting. And that's a part, I would say, is not really baked in anyone's models or numbers. This could be a very, very sizable business for our company. And as I've mentioned, just the GMP proteins alone could double the size of our core protein business. Remember, we're the world leader in protein in research. That gives you an idea of just that component. Quad is a big part of that.  So if we can get qualified in a few of these clinicals and it goes into production, we're going to sell a lot of beads. We're not really talking about what those numbers would be. You've looked at the market, you've looked at other beads that are out there, we're going to, hopefully, be replacing a lot of them that are in the market today because we think ours is superior. The customers are saying so. They're lining up, a lot of them are replacing, ours for others and some clinicals currently and we'll have to see. This will be a big year to see how Quad comes through. We didn't -- we bought it pretty early, we didn't pay a lot for. It's a fantastic team, fantastic technologies, fantastic set of IP. And hopefully, next year, we can start talking about it more in line with the complete workflow and we'll start bragging about that once we hopefully complete a few more steps in this whole thing. We're quite there yet, but it's coming together pretty well. Charles Steinman : Got it. And then just quick last one for me. I think you guys on the last call were still talking about maybe high single-digit growth for the year inching into double digits. Obviously, 3 quarters, until fiscal year we're well ahead of that rate seem to indicate that maybe double-digit growth is now more reasonable with, I think, year-to-date you're at around 12%. So with that in mind, is there anything that gives you pause or leads you to believe that growth would decel into Q2 such that you wouldn't expect at least 12% to the bar for the full year? Charles Kummeth : Well, we don't give guidance. We do give annual. And we said all year, our goal was to be 10% or better. As you point out number at 12%, really have to do pretty horribly this quarter to not reach 10% or better this for the year. But we're still pretty set on that. In terms of quarter, there's timing issue, there's OEM order issues, there's the diagnostics component issue. We had a pretty strong quarter of diagnostics, you can almost guess that means probably for the next quarter because that's kind of we've been, very lumpy. So we're going to be in that 8% to 12% range and for the year, will be well over 10%. I'm hoping we can get to 11% for the year. I mean our goal is to become a perennial double-digit grower, this hopefully, will be our first year to do that and we'll see how this quarter goes that all saw a pretty good comp from last year. And as you point out, going forward now they're not all going to be going good comps and we have to continue to do things.  Now one think I'll point out in the next year -- if we get Medicare this year, it'll be almost the whole fiscal year, almost all of that revenue coming will be organic for Exosome. So it's going to be a nice padding. So we're really hoping to get that. We will get it, but whenever we do get it is going to be like a step up in terms of revenue recognition for the organic calculation from exo alone. That was the reinvigoration of ACD. We know which has some poor comps going forward. So that's going to help our growth numbers organically. So all in, we're looking towards the next fiscal year being a very good year. I don't think we're promising 12% for the year, but we're hoping to be a perennial double-digit grower from here on end, so. And we have to keep doing things in the portfolio to do that because there are going to be misfires there are going to be things up and down, there's going to be timing issues, there's going to be funding issues. Europe may finally slump for us like it has in most others, but we'll see. China has been great, Japan is decent for us, India is growing 100% for us. At that rate, in 2 years and 3 years, India is going to be material. So we've got other arrows in the quiver here to help us continually make that 10% or better because that's why you have a portfolio, right, because never -- nothing ever really hits all at once. When they do, you get a quarter like this one, 14%. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our next question from Alex Nowak with Craig-Hallum capital group. Alexander Nowak : So just staying on the topic of EPI here. You provided some color on the time line here for reimbursement with NGS. So you mentioned a meeting in June. Do you anticipate NGS to issue a draft LCD in September, which would then go file at a later date here? Or are you expecting the final LCD to come out in September? Just want to clarify that. Charles Kummeth : Well, the way we understand it is the open meeting is in June, okay? We'll know in May whether it will be in the agenda. We have to be in the agenda to be able to hit that. If we hit that, there's a 45 day, whatever time frame that's in the process. So that's why we're talking on August still. And I think it's from that August to September is when it would be finalized and be complete and be activated. If we miss the June meeting well then there's probably another quarter. So we don't know, they're not -- we don't talk to them. They don't tell us anything. So we know we've done everything we're supposed to do. There's no homework for us to do, there's no data to provide. There's nothing left for us. We're in the guidelines, we know discussion will come out in the guidelines very soon. And we're hoping to be at the top tier in that discussion as the best solution in that and that's also going to help. So we've got all the wind is on our sail that we can, I think, expect to try to get this completed. And even so, I'd like to point out, as my team points out, these things usually takes 3 to 5 years. And that you personally pointed out to us before a couple of quarters ago and we're still on a record clip for the milestones we're hitting with the NCCN guidelines. And if we get our Medicare, our reimbursement in August it'll be like a record in terms of timing. So this is a platform that really works, the data is really good, there are patients really using it and benefiting and we know we need to get more of it. So hopefully these institutions will bless it and let us move on So we'll see. Alexander Nowak : Yes. Understood. Thanks for the color there. outside of partnering here you've been quiet on the M&A front recently. So when do we expect to see Bio-Techne go back down in to the market and make a new acquisition? Charles Kummeth : Yes, we just went under 2x leverage and so we recently have a little bit of dry powder. I would say, I think our shareholders and our constituents would like to see us really get the integration complete with Exosome. We just got ACD kind of through integration kind of back on track, so those are 2 big legs in this stool that we paid a lot of money for. So I think staring now, we've got a good pipeline. We've got over 100 things we're always looking at. And as I mentioned, we're hunting, especially for deals in this cell and gene therapy workflow. So we're -- we got quite a few things that we're looking at there, so expect some hopefully some announcements soon in that area, we'll see. We're not looking for another leg in the school -- stool in terms of a new ACD or a new Exosome right now. But you know, you never know. We're open for business and we want to create a very healthy portfolio company of life science tools and diagnostics and we'll just have to see what becomes available. As you know, we are not the big participants in the public auction process. There are more private for us and we're always hunting on building relationships and seeing what we can get for a deal that's beneficial for us as well as whoever owns it and then we don't usually buy things we can't get to a 10% ROIC in 5 years. So it takes a lot fourth due diligence, a lot of hard work and relationship building to define that and get both sides to agree to a price that allows both sides to find value, so don't count us out. Alexander Nowak : Understood. And just a follow-up to a previous question, I might have missed this. When do you expect to complete the GMP facility buildout here in Minneapolis? Charles Kummeth : All in about a year. Operator : And Ladies and gentlemen, this time I'll turn back to Chuck Kummeth for any additional or closing remarks. Charles Kummeth : Well, again, I think we had a -- by the calling count about another record this quarter. So thank you for your interest. It was a great quarter for us. We have an outstanding team here at Bio-Techne. People are committed. Never happy or never worked harder and we're all benefiting from it. So I appreciate your interest and we'll talk to you in the next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning and welcome to the Bio-Techne Earnings Conference Call for the Fourth Quarter of Fiscal Year 2019. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the call will be opened for questions following management's prepared remarks. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jim Hippel, Bio-Techne's Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir. Jim Hippel : Thank you. And good morning. And thank you for joining us. On the call with me this morning is Chuck Kummeth, Chief Executive Officer of Bio-Techne. Before we begin, let me briefly cover our Safe Harbor statement. Some of the comments made during this conference call may be considered forward-looking statements, including beliefs and expectations about the Company's future results. The Company's 10-K for fiscal year 2018 identifies certain factors that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements made during this call. The Company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of any new information or future events or developments. The 10-K as well as the Company's other SEC filings are available on the Company's website within its Investor Relations section. During the call, non-GAAP financial measures may be used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. Tables reconciling these measures to most comparable GAAP measures are available in the Company's press release issued earlier this morning on the Bio-Techne Corporation website at www.bio-techne.com. I'll now turn the call over to Chuck. Chuck Kummeth : Thanks Jim. And good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter conference call. The fourth quarter closed out a record fiscal year for Bio-Techne where we achieved an important milestone of double-digit annual organic growth in fiscal '19, 10.5% to be exact. This represents the first year of double-digit organic growth for Bio-Techne and the kind of growth we strive to continue for many years to come. In our fiscal Q4, we generated 7% organic growth, which we expected would be lower than our annual average due to the choppy order timing of our Diagnostics OEM business, as well as some tough year-over-year comps we had in the Europe region. But I am pleased to report that our key growth platforms, the ones that have performed exceptionally well for us all year, continued their strong performance in the fourth quarter. These include antibodies, assays, cell and gene therapy, Simple Western, Simple Plex and ACD, all growing double-digit for the quarter and the full year. As we look at our performance by geography, let me start with Europe. In Q4, Europe struggled to grow over last year due to a number of headwinds it faced this quarter. None of these headwinds were overly significant on their own, but put together they presented a challenge for Europe to grow in the most recent quarter. These headwinds included the year-on-year timing of a recurring significant big pharma order, the timing of the Easter holiday this year versus last, a tough Q4 comp where they grew in the low teens last year, and even a record hot weather in the last several weeks of June that kept many people at home to stay cool. If researchers aren't at the bench, then they are not using or buying our products, especially in our run rate reagent business. Let's not forget, Europe has been a standout for the past three years now with double-digit organic growth for the better part of this time. And even with a softer Q4, we finished the fiscal year with the European organic growth in the high-single digits. I couldn't be more proud of the way our European team has led the company in finding and creating collaborative synergies between the divisions and providing a superior buying experience for our customers. We remain confident that our European team will still perform near the top of our industry going forward. With regards to the other major regions, they continue to perform exceedingly well in the quarter as they have all year. North America's organic growth was in the mid-teens for the quarter and the full year. And China's growth in Q4 was over 20% and over 25% for the full year. There has been a lot of effort dedicated to our go-to-market strategy with our superior website, which allows customers to do complex product searches, and the introduction of over 1,200 new products over the course of the year. The wave in oncology research as well as solid NIH funding has also allowed 2019 to become a record year. The evidence is strong that the wave will continue across the globe. Now, let's dive a little deeper into performance of our growth platform, starting with those with the Protein Sciences segment, which organically grew 9% for the quarter and 13% for the full fiscal year. Antibodies and assays performed extremely well for us in Q4 as they have all year, with both product categories growing in the mid-teens and in the quarter and the full year. The growth has also been broad across brands and applications whether it be in our traditional R&D systems branded antibodies and ELISAs or in our newer Novus brand antibodies and multiplex assays. Much of this success, we believe, is attributed to our laser focus on digital solutions. We have an entire team dedicated to leveraging our investments in salesforce.com, our website and our trade shows to ensure a more comprehensive view of activity with our customers, making it easier for our customers to be aware of the product categories that we offer and help them find the specific solution they need. The Simple Western platform has now reached a critical junction of acceptance in our end markets. We regularly ship over 100 instruments per quarter and we have now installed over 1,500 worldwide. The Simple Plex platform achieved growth rates of nearly 50% this past year and is becoming more and more material to the Company. Earlier in the year, we signed a very strategic deal with Micropoint of Shenzhen, China which could deliver us revenue between $50 million and $100 million in about three years. They are taking a leading-edge Simple Plex technology and launching a CFDA-approved patient monitoring solution for large hospitals in China. The patient monitoring system is for cytokines release storm syndrome, which can be an undesirable effect for gene and cell therapies. Speaking of cell and gene therapies, this product line within the Protein Sciences segment also contributed double-digit growth in both the quarter and the year. While still a relatively small portion of our business today, cell and gene therapy will be a very important growth driver for our company in the years to follow. In the past couple of years, we have moved further into the bioprocessing and cell therapy markets, mainly as a reagents and instrument for a supplier. With our GMP proteins polymer bead technology, non-viral vectors and instrumentation monitoring, we can now supply a significant portion of the cell and gene therapy workflow. Starting with Quad's QuickGel non-magnetic beads, we can select and activate cells. And now, with B-MoGen's non-viral transposon technology, we can provide gene editing tools. Next, we can see the gene-edited cells with our world-renowned GMP proteins. And finally, our Ella platform can perform immunoassay testing to check for cytokine production and our RNAscope technology can perform follow-on single cell imaging analysis. Let me talk a little more about the gene editing piece of the workflow that we recently added via the acquisition of B-MoGen at the end of Q4. B-MoGen's technologies solve the most complex gene-editing problems with the proprietary, cutting-edge gene editing and delivery tools, enabling and accelerating growth in immunotherapy treatments. This technology holds the promise of being able to deliver personalized therapeutic agents that have greater target effect and less off-target side effects. B-MoGen's key non-viral vector technology obviate several concerns associated with the use of viral vectors, including simplification of the entire vector manufacturing process, reduced biosafety concerns related to cytotoxicity, mutagenesis or malignant transformation of target cells and greater flexibility in payload size. With all this great technology and a hot market demand, we feel confident we are on the way to having a healthy cell and gene therapy business. This business will take a few years to grow to material level for the company, but we see explosive growth in this space and our larger biopharma customers have been asking us to invest further in this direction. This year, we intend to build a $50 million GMP proteins factory here in Minnesota, in addition to expanding the workflow offering to our customers. I fully expect this business to be at least a $200 million division in five years. Moving on to our Diagnostics and Genomics segment where this year we had a confluence of three different stories that may make the overall picture appear a bit murky. I'll attempt to make the picture less murky. The first story is with regards to our legacy diagnostics OEM business. currently, this makes up the largest portion of the segment and has suffered from the most headwinds this past year. The largest headwind continues to be the glucose controls business where our OEM customers are moving to continuous monitoring. Business did a good job offsetting most of the volume drop off with price increases as we largely remain the last man standing in this hard-hit business. With glucose controls becoming less material every quarter, the impact of this erosion to the segment is largely behind us. Another headwind has been some tough comps and order timing from BiosPacific, our diagnostics antibody business. This niche business sources specialized antibodies for large diagnostic customers. The orders come in relatively large batch sizes and, therefore, can be very lumpy in timing. They were especially lumpy this year. But this small, specialized business produces tremendous margin for the company and they have a strong customer pipeline going forward. Our in vitro OEM diagnostic assay business located in San Marcos has seen some delays in their pipeline of new OEM product launches. But over the course of the next couple of years, we are very confident this business will grow at least mid-single-digit rates. Meanwhile, our hematology controls business in Minneapolis has seen steady growth this past year as they do most years and we expect that to continue. The second major story within the Diagnostics and Genomics segment this year has been the reemergence of one of our key growth platforms, ACD, within our Genomics division. As many of you know, the Genomics division had a rocky start to the fiscal year following a blowout 2018 where ACD overachieved on their earn-out milestone of $45 million in revenue. We struggled with these tough comps in the first two quarters of the year, but in the second half of the year, our Genomics division posted greater than 20% growth in both Q3 and Q4. We now have a catalog over 25,000 probes in inventory and continue to add new applications using the ACD technology, including our most recent commercial release of the RNAscope high-plex assay, a multi-plex in situ hybridization assay for tissues. We see much more growth to come for our Genomics division as pathologists and researchers transition from the antibody-driven IHC world to molecular approach. In the diagnostics end market for ACD, the collaboration with Leica and other large automation partners continue to advance. The HPV test is selling well and there is a healthy pipeline of new tests in development. Finally, the third story within our Diagnostics and Genomics segment has been Exosome Diagnostics. With the acquisition of this pre-revenue liquid biopsy company in early fiscal '19, we obtained yet another growth platform that will accelerate the Company's growth rate for years to come. Our exosome-driven diagnostics platform is unique in the liquid biopsy field and is positioned to become a true standard of care for diagnosing, treating and monitoring cancers as well as other diseases. Our diagnostics products will enable physicians to take a more targeted and precise approach in their treatment strategies and thus improve patient outcomes while lowering overall healthcare costs. EPI, a rule-out test for prostate cancer, is the first of many potential diagnostic tests using both urine and blood derived exosomes that we will seek to commercialize over the coming years. Future tests may include non-invasive diagnostic cancer tests for bladder, lung and breast, as well as diagnosis for kidney transplant rejection and certain neurological diseases. In its first 18 months of commercialization, EPI has completed a breathtaking number of milestones, including more than 25,000 patients have used the EPI test to help them and their doctors make a more informed decision as to whether to proceed with a prostate tissue biopsy. Nearly 2,000 physicians have prescribed EPI for their patients. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network, or NCCN, included EPI as a recommended test in their clinical practice guidelines in oncology for prostate cancer early detection. We received a clinical laboratory permit from the New York State Department of Health to provide EPI tests in New York, a state with a population that supports more than 10% of the addressable market and is key to eventually garnering private payer coverage from large national health insurance providers. The National Government Services, NGS, has recommended Medicare coverage for EPI in its most recent draft local coverage decision. We expect this decision to become final within the next several months. The FDA has granted breakthrough device designation for the EPI tests, making it the first exosome-based liquid biopsy test to receive a breakthrough device designation. This designation not only validates the clinical importance of our EPI tests, but also marks a milestone in the advancement of our patented technology platform. We have contracted with 26 commercial health plans and PPO networks and have enrolled coverage by Medicaid in 34 states. That's an amazing amount of progress to what is essentially a small startup with a new technology platform. This positions us extremely well for fiscal '20 to be a breakout year in terms of revenue from Exosome Diagnostics. With over 1 million unnecessary prostate biopsies performed every year just in the U.S., we couldn't be more excited about serving what has been until now a very unmet need. And EPI is just the beginning. A liquid biopsy test for early detection of bladder cancer is on deck and we have already started the process of collecting patient samples for clinical studies on this biomarker signature. We've come a long way from solely being a proteins, antibodies and ELISA kits manufacturer. With our strong brand and science presence, we have moved closer to the clinic, by diagnosing disease conditions like cancer with our Exosomes Diagnostics acquisition, our automated immunoassay platform Simple Plex and ACD's RNAscope technology platforms. We are now a company that can provide tools for cancer research, diagnostics and therapeutics, like CAR-T cell workflow. It's an exciting time for our company. The serendipity of the past 40 years of innovation of cytokines that we pioneered as research tools are now providing their long-term value by becoming key tools for diagnosis and therapies too. I am proud of the team here at Bio-Techne and the accomplishments we have made in 2019. 2020 is another year and we are ready to rise to the challenges ahead of us and executing the strategy we have set. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim. Jim Hippel : Thanks, Chuck. I'll provide an overview of our Q4 financial performance for the total company, as well as provide some color on each of our segments. Starting with the overall fourth quarter financial performance, adjusted EPS was $1.25 versus $1.34 one year ago with foreign exchange negatively impacting EPS by $0.03. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.42 compared to $1.08 in the prior year. The biggest driver for the decrease in GAAP EPS was the change in fair value of our investment in ChemoCentryx, which impacted the GAAP reported number by $0.91. Q4 reported revenue was $191.7 million, an increase of 6% year-over-year with organic revenue increasing 7%. Fourth quarter reported sales includes a 1% growth contribution from acquisitions and a 2% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange translation. For the full year, organic growth was 10.5%. By geography, the U.S. grew in the mid-teens, while Europe experienced a low-single-digit decrease and China grew over 20%. As for the rest of Asia, organic growth was in the mid-single digits. By end market, which excludes Asia and our Diagnostics division, biopharma and academia growth were comparable in the respective regions. For the full year, the U.S. grew in the mid-teens. Europe grew in the high-single digits. China grew north of 25%. And the rest of Asia grew in the high-single digits. Moving on to the details of the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin was relatively flat compared to the prior year at 71.9% in Q4, with operational productivity and favorable mix, offset by the acquisition of Exosome Diagnostics and foreign currency headwinds. Adjusted SG&A in Q4 was 28.3% of revenue, 370 basis points higher than the prior year where volume leverage was more than offset by the additional SG&A added as a result of the Exosome Diagnostics acquisition, as well as investments in our core business to support growth. R&D expense in Q4 was 8.5% of revenue, relatively flat to the prior quarter and 70 basis points higher than the prior year due to the acquisition of Exosome Diagnostics. The resulting adjusted operating margin for Q4 was 35.1%, relatively flat to the prior quarter and a decrease of 440 basis points from the prior-year period. However, core adjusted operating margin, excluding acquisitions, was relatively flat to last year and would have been 40% were it not for the negative impact of foreign exchange. For the full year, core adjusted operating margin, excluding acquisitions, expanded 150 basis points over the prior year. Looking at our numbers below operating income, net interest expense in Q4 was $5.2 million compared to $2.9 million of net interest expense last year. The higher interest expense is driven by higher debt levels that resulted from our acquisition of Exosome Diagnostics in Q1. Our bank debt on the balance sheet as of the end of Q4 stood at $505.1 million, down from $522.3 million at the end of Q3. Other adjusted non-operating income for the quarter was $0.1 million compared to $0.3 million of other expense in the prior-year quarter due to favorable transactional foreign exchange. For GAAP reporting, other non-operating includes realized and unrealized gains or losses from our investments in ChemoCentryx and B-MoGen. Moving on down the P&L, our adjusted effective tax rate in Q4 and the full year was 21.1% and we expect this rate to hold steady - relatively steady into the fiscal 2020. Turning to cash flow and return of capital, $55.9 million of cash was generated from operations in the fourth quarter and our net investment in capital expenditures was $11.7 million. The increase in CapEx from prior quarters was driven by project timing and capacity expansion projects. $12.1 million of dividends were paid out in the quarter and average diluted shares stood at 39.1 million shares outstanding. Next, I'll discuss the performance of our reporting segments, starting with the Protein Sciences segment. Q4 reported sales were $143.4 million, with reported revenue increasing 7%. Organic growth was 9%, with foreign exchange unfavorably impacting growth by 2%. As Chuck already described, the growth in this segment was very broad in almost every major product category and geographic region, with the exception being Europe. Operating margin for the Protein Sciences segment was 45.4%, an increase of 90 basis points year-over-year due to strong volume leverage and operational productivity, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange and the Quad acquisition. Excluding the impact of FX and Quad, operating margins for the segment expanded 200 basis points. Turning to the Diagnostics and Genomics segment, Q4 reported sales were $48.5 million, an increase of 4% from the prior year. Organically, revenues grew 2%, with a 3% growth contribution from acquisitions and a 1% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange translation. Partially offsetting the strong growth we saw from our Genomics division was the glucose market headwinds and order timing issues in our OEM Diagnostics division that Chuck previously mentioned. Excluding the few customer-specific orders that negatively impacted the quarter, the rest of the Diagnostics division experienced overall growth in the mid-single digits for the quarter and the year. While we can't guarantee that there will be no customer-specific delays next year, we currently don't foresee those issues, and thus would expect mid-single digit growth in this division going forward. With regards to Exosome Diagnostics, and as I've stated in prior calls, revenues from EPI tests performed is being recognized on a cash basis. This is the correct accounting treatment given its recent commercial launch in 2018. For patients insured by private payers, the cycle from test report date to payment can be quite long. This is especially true for patients covered by PPOs. For patients insured by Medicare, payment is pending a final decision made by CMS on reimbursement. With Medicare approval still pending, a very limited amount of cash is being collected on tests currently performed. Thus, the revenue from EPI recorded in our Q4 results was rather minimal, and we'll be continuing to focus our dialog on current test trends, private payer contract coverage and public reimbursement decisions, knowing that revenue recognition will lag. Moving on to operating margin for the Diagnostics and Genomics segment, at 10.3%, the segment's operating margin was substantially lower than the prior year, but up 270 basis points from the prior quarter. Excluding the dilution from the Exosome Diagnostics acquisition, Q4 operating margin for the segment was 24.8%. For the full year, both the OEM Diagnostics division and the Genomics division had expanding operating margins year-over-year. In summary, for the quarter, our breadth of growth continues to be solid both in terms of end markets and product categories. The product categories that are leading our growth now are the same platforms that can scale and lead us to our five-year financial goals. These platforms are antibodies, Simple Western, cell and gene therapy, Simple Plex, ACD and, in fiscal year '20, we can add Exosome Diagnostics to that list. Thus, we expect that fiscal year '19 will not only be the first, but the first of many years where our company will execute on our strategic plan of double-digit organic growth. But as most of you know, successful execution of our strategic plan doesn't only mean top line double-digit growth, but also a march towards 40% adjusted operating margins. With our core business expanding its adjusted operating margin by 150 basis points in fiscal year '19, we were already very close to that strategic goal. Now, with the acquisitions of Exosome Diagnostics, Quad Technologies and B-MoGen in fiscal year '19, our margins have been reset. But the strategic goal of marching back towards 40% margin has not changed. We've proven, after past acquisitions where our margins have been reset, namely ProteinSimple and ACD, that we can execute on our strategic plan on both the top and the bottom line and we intend to do that again. However, the reset is not complete. We still have some carryover headwinds from acquisitions we made in fiscal year '19 that will pressure margins by up to 60 basis points for next fiscal year. Also, with recent strength in U.S. dollar, it is possible that foreign exchange will continue to be a year-over-year headwind on margins by up to 40 basis points. In addition to the impact from acquisitions, we are making a major investment in our cell and gene therapy platform by building a new factory dedicated to the production of GMP grade reagents. These reagents will be needed by our biopharma customers in large scale quantities as their cell and gene therapies get FDA approved and move to production. We expect the investment will be approximately $50 million over the course of the next 12 to 18 months. This cost will include viral testing of our existing products to be manufactured in the new facility. It will also include upfront sales and marketing campaigns to make our customers more aware of our new strategic cell and gene therapy workflow offering, ultimately seeding our products in more clinical and preclinical trials. This is a big investment, but with huge potential returns. We call this our internal acquisition. We see the possibility of our cell and gene therapy offering generating more than $200 million of annual revenue five years from now. While most of this investment will initially be in the form of capital expenditures, there will be a portion of it that will be expensed through the P&L. In fiscal year '20, we expect the P&L impact will be a headwind of approximately 50 basis points. Despite the headwinds mentioned, therefore, prior-year acquisitions, foreign exchange and cell and gene therapy investment, we continue to march down our strategic plan and execute on the margin expansion that was part of that plan. If successful, we expect to cover most, if not all, of these headwinds and hold overall fiscal year adjusted operating margins relatively flat to fiscal year '19. The timing of these investments as well as the carryover impact of our Exosome Diagnostics acquisition will put the most pressure on our margins in the first quarter of fiscal year '20, followed by steady sequential improvement throughout the rest of the year. That concludes my prepared comments. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Dorrie to open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question today from Puneet Souda with SVB Leerink. Please go ahead, sir. Puneet Souda : So, first one on your comments on Europe, I just wanted to understand your longer-term expectations and outlook here for Europe and how should we be thinking about Europe in fiscal '20? And could you elaborate if this was largely weakness in specific product segments of the Protein segment or was this just broadly across the entire Protein Sciences segment? Chuck Kummeth : Sure, Puneet. Well, I think the first thing to stay with us, there is probably a bit of lumpiness compared to last quarter. We had a blow-out quarter last quarter. There's probably some impact there, a little. But, overall - we're already seeing a good bounce back this quarter. Europe is looking very good. It is a little bit more of a - stronger with the reagent side of the business versus the instruments but instruments is still early in the cycle for the quarter we know where they will end up. It's a very much a back-ended model. But we see high-single digit going forward. It's probably isn't the triple digits we saw for three years almost. But, remember, we saw that because of the integrations of distributors we did and creating new subsidiaries and then really doing that co-synergy cross-selling model. We're really taking share and just scooping up all that business that should have been ours. So, now we're there. It's kind of in our run rate. And we've got to grow with everybody else. So, high-single digit is kind of where we're at. And I think it's looking pretty good. And again, so far this quarter, Europe is looking a lot better Puneet Souda : And on Diagnostics, specifically, with the glucose products, given that continuous glucose monitoring is a new technology that continues to gain adoption in the market. what's your expectation here for the glucose segment? Is mid-single digits still something that you expect longer term or how do you view the glucose products as being strategic to your core high-growth business in the Protein businesses? Jim Hippel : Well, they're not that strategic. They come with the business, When I started here, it was over $20 million business. It's less than half of that now going forward. So, we've mitigated a lot of that erosion with price controls. We are the last man standing. After us, you have to go to China for these things. So, there is no way these large diagnostic companies are going to re-qualify with a Chinese entrant, especially in today's environment. So, we're kind of safe. It's under a $10 million kind of business now for us. It's largely behind us. And not strategic. I think there won't be a lot of growth. It is going to be kind of a hold-your-own for a while and steady down and we're offsetting that with other growth platforms in that segment, mainly around San Marcos, working with those same providers, those same customers on whole new ideas. The San Marcos acquisition from many years ago was a small player, but, remember, it had over 180 different 510(k)s. So, it's very strong in the pipeline with these large diagnostic companies with spec-ed in solutions and we're building on that with the credibility of Bio-Techne behind them. We've come a long way. I have been talking a couple of years about the strength of this pipeline. The trouble is, these guys move slow. They are glacier pace here. They are the largest diagnostics companies and pharma companies in the world. And they take a large order, anyway we've talked about in the past. Again, we had a quarter where some flipped out into this next quarter and we probably had some pull-ahead from last quarter, as I mentioned. But we're on track for a decent quarter this quarter already. It's the same lumpiness. And that pipeline is getting better and better. And it will be, ultimately, a mid to high-single digit overall segment without Genomics. And we're on track for that actually. And this blip this quarter, we've seen it at least three or four quarters in the past of this level and it's bouncing back already. That's just the lumpiness of this situation. What is new is that we had some really big order and order comparisons that were pushed out for the BiosPacific area. And these are nearly $2 million kind of levels of orders. So, it would have a big impact on our overall growth rate. And they're already shipping this quarter. So, that's a little bit new, but it's part of that same segment. So, it kind of exasperates the look of this division. But, really, things aren't already any worse, they never been with the normal lumpiness this division. So, it's just kind of the way it is. Mid-single to high-single digit growth ahead in the year to two to come but we've got to land and get these deals kind of moving. And they're going to happen. They're spec-ing in. They're just large companies, don't moving very fast when they're qualifying new solutions in a regulated world. Puneet Souda : Okay, thanks for all the details. And if I could squeeze a last one on Exosome. We saw the draft LCD and given your conversations with NGS and the expectations for final LCD, do you think the one EPI test per patient requirement, this is likely to potentially change maybe by the time it's finalized or maybe even longer term? Sort of, how are you thinking about the overall market opportunity given that limitation is in place for the EPI test? Jim Hippel : Yes, Puneet. I know you have a little consternation over this, but this has always been the plan. This has always been the model. It's still 1.1 million biopsies and we tend to get a big chunk of those. Looking forward, the December dates, the outside date, the open period is over and we're waiting for confirmation of that. Everything is wrong. We could be a month or two ahead of December. We don't know. But December should be the outside date. For the short term, the single-use will have no impact. We're talking a year or two out before there's any impact, and by then we're going to have the additional studies and FDA requirements in for having hopefully multiple reimbursement. So, that has been the plan, always has been the plan and we're more than on track for all that. So, we don't see any issue with that whatsoever, to be honest. And also, the fast - the breakthrough status designation we get with the FDA is going to - that's - they are already reaching out to us, offering to help. That's what you get with the status. They want to help this platform on multi-facets of bladder next and other areas. This is going to be a platform. So, this isn't just EPI. So, we're going to - this has been a - we're told a record kind of a move with this platform with EPI, usually a three to five year kind of process and we're under two years and it's going to be the same rate the new stuff coming. So, five years from now looking back, it's going to be something to watch, I think, as a new novel platform that has just a ton of promise. And that's why we're getting the recognition we're getting. That's why we got the breakthrough status. That's why we got the LCD we did in the record timing. That's why we got NCCN guidelines and we are definitely kind of ahead of the pack in that guidelines and discussion as well as the statistics. We have the two studies. The data is all there for us to submit for FDA. That's in progress. That too has some impact on that multiple designation reimbursement, but steady as she goes here. Operator : Our next question comes from Catherine Schulte with Baird. Please go ahead, ma'am. Catherine Schulte : Just first on China, you had another strong quarter there. Anything in particular to call out? And then, what's your outlook for China in fiscal '20? Chuck Kummeth : Look, it's the same. Definitely north of 20%. Maybe 25% or better. We'll see. A lot of it will come down to whether we can really get ACD really lit up there, the Genomics segment. Little bit of an issue there with Chinese citizens working outside countries on tissue. But we're working through that, but the basic RNAscope business is exploding there and we're building into that. That's on top of the core business which is 20-plus-percent. Our instrument business has been very strong this past year. Some of that may have been a bit of a pull-ahead, I'd say, three quarters ago, starting - and kind of went away last quarter in terms of tariff perceptions, which really aren't an issue for us. By the way, they don't continue to be even with this new round of tariffs as well. So, we see no impact. Our teams are telling us, steady as she goes. We have strong government support for our company and our products. We are very alone with a lot of what we do and they know that. Do they want these in their pipeline for solutions for their citizens? So, looking good for next year as well. We don't see any impact. Catherine Schulte : And then, on Exosome, how many volumes were run in the quarter for EPI? And are you seeing any increased interest following the draft Medicare LCD? And then, as you look into fiscal ' 20, what are your current assumptions for EPI revenue and any updated thoughts on a potential look back from Medicare? Jim Hippel : We're careful how much guidance we give on that. We do have a lot of competitive pressures as well. The last two quarters, ever since we've put in the guidelines, have notched up the competition against us in terms of promotions, even giving things away. And that's had some impact on our growth rate here, but it's been pretty solid. Again, over 25,000 tests that we're not even reimbursed yet is a pretty solid indication. We're not sure we're going to see a major step up with the reimbursement decision here in the coming month or two or it will be a steady and increased growth. We hear all kinds of opinions. I think we're going to see steady growth. We are investing now into the infrastructure, the sales team and everything else because we - this is going to happen. We're going to be reimbursed. The payers are moving great. Our collections there have moved up 300% in the last quarter, in fact. So, it's all going the right direction. So, we're starting to invest. We're watching our dilution, but we're going to go after this. And I think our goal from a year ago - and the way you've got to look at this, we kind of lost a year from a year ago, right, the way we came out and not understanding revenue recognition like we should have, et cetera, but we're on track at this point this year, and we're going after those same kinds of goals. So, the numbers we gave you a year ago are kind of the annual numbers we should see end of the year again. So, we just aren't going to talk about it much or the number of our sales people or these other competitive issues. Chuck Kummeth : Just not give a heads up to the other companies chasing this lucrative area. Catherine Schulte : Okay, that makes sense. And then lastly, I just wanted to spend a few minutes on cell and gene therapy. This is becoming a bigger focus area for you. And you've done a number of acquisitions in this space. Are there any other technologies you'd be interested in adding to that portfolio? And how much of a growth driver do you think this could be over the next several years? Chuck Kummeth : Well, as Jim made in his comments, we see it between a $200 million to $300 million division probably five years or so from now. It could be a lot bigger. The potential is massive. It's just a matter of how fast can we execute and become real. As we go along that that new curve, there's going to be some OpEx because we have to be more visible in the game as well, but we are being pushed. We've been being pushed for a couple of years by all the big players in this industry about, we need your proteins, can you please - can you please give us large batches of GMP which we're not known for. So, we are exploding in our growth right now of GMP proteins, but they're still small batch until we get this new factory up. The building is purchased. We're moving forward as we speak here on that. And 18 months from now, we should be fully qualified and in production. And it will be a handful of proteins, not tens of thousands, but they all are large batch and all GMP. And also antibody. There is a nice set of antibodies that are also being requested. And, of course, we're very good at that. What else can I say about - there are other areas. We have four or five major steps in that workflow. We don't have the leukapheresis box, but we are working closely with a partner to move forward to that. We have nothing to pronounce yet. We don't have a standard around a bio-reactor, but we have a great relationship with one of the world leaders in this space. But we are going to largely be a compartmental, a modularized solution, so that we can have a cost advantage over the no penny solution out there. It ties everything to one system to a patient in an ICU for three weeks and ends up being very, very expensive. We're going to have a better approach. And we are, I think, farther along than anybody else in the world. So, it's coming. And we're very close to having a full workflow. We have well over half of it now and they're all generating revenue. The B-MoGen piece is going to be important. We have eight preclinicals done. We have 12 interested parties. We have many indications that are going to go to clinical sometime this year, we expect. So, that will be a big portion, maybe as much as a third of that $200 million to $300 million divisional amount. And, of course, the Quad polymer beads are also part of that workflow. They are very similar. And they've succeeded in more than a half a dozen pre-clinicals and are being mapped in, as we speak. So, future is bright for this whole segment. And we're still hunting for a few more acquisitions to solve these remaining holes for a complete workflow. Either that or collaborations, but we're well on our way. And even if we get none of that, we still have a very good model to generate an awful lot of revenue. So, a lot of credibility in this space. So... Catherine Schulte : All right, great. Thank you. Chuck Kummeth : Just GMP proteins alone will be $140 million plus five years from now. Just the protein component. Operator : And our next question comes from Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, sir. Dan Leonard : So, first question for Jim. Jim, I just want to make sure I understand all your forward-looking comments in the context of 2020. Did I hear that you expect double-digit organic revenue growth in 2020? And as I think about the more cautious commentary you were making on margins, does that roll up into a flat operating margin in 2020 compared to 2019? Jim Hippel : Yes, correct on all accounts. So, essentially, we do expect to be - have double-digit growth in fiscal year 2020. I mentioned - I called out three specific headwinds, foreign exchange, carryover of acquisition, and investment in our cell and gene therapy business that will produce about 150 basis points of headwind to our margins next year. But we - as we did in fiscal year '19, we expect our core businesses to continue their march on productivity and gain approximately 150 basis points of margin to offset that. So, essentially, flat year-over-year on margin. Dan Leonard : And then another... Chuck Kummeth : You remember organic... Dan Leonard : Sorry. Chuck Kummeth : You remember, a couple of years ago, we talked ranges a lot. Last year was the first year we kind of gave an annual kind of guidance of an expectation of 10% or better, which we did, and we did that resoundingly well even given this quarter is a flat quarter. We're seeing it again, but we would also say that the new range has moved from 8% to 12% to more like a 10% to 12% or better. A lot is going to depend on Exosome revenue. Exosome revenue comes in where we think, it could be 12% plus. But 10% should be - like Jim said, should be in the cards, even in our core and everything going as steady as she goes at this point. So, it's a great time to be here. After six long years, we have finally made it to being, we think, a double-digit grower. So, unless some new factors hit, competitive or whatever. But right now, that's where we see things. Dan Leonard : And Chuck, just another clarification. So, when thinking about the OEM timing impact on the quarter in Diagnostics, was that about 100 basis point headwind to the total company organic revenue growth in the quarter? Did I hear that correctly? Chuck Kummeth : It's in the range, yeah. Yes, it's in the range. And if you combine that with probably some pull-aheads that we probably weren't really - really knew they were last quarter, maybe even a little more. We had 14-plus-percent growth last quarter. And it probably should have been 11% or 12%, like you guys were expecting them. All this stuff, we're still not big a company. It's hard to smooth everything out perfectly every quarter. So, you're in the ballpark. Dan Leonard : And then my final question on EPI. So, could you talk about your thinking around submitting that product to the FDA? As I understand it, that wasn't part of the initial plan. And then, secondly, how are you thinking about operationalizing the Medicare decision? Is there any sort of plumbing you need to put in place to get revenue or does it happen pretty seamlessly once that LCD is finalized? Thank you. Chuck Kummeth : Well, there's a lot in that. Let's unpack it a little bit. One is, we're still outsourcing all our collections. It's a really complicated process and we've actually talked to peer companies, like Exact Sciences and others, about what do they do in the beginning. And it's a big deal going from cash to accrual, especially with private payers, and we're still outsourcing that. We'll probably do that for some time. At some point, we will bring it in, but not for a while yet until we get this under control. We are growing our collections in our private side very quickly. And so, it won't be more than a year or two out, probably. In terms of the infrastructure, there was a lot of infrastructure when we bought this thing, right? So, they were definitely ahead of their skis and we toned that back, as you know, while we are waiting this extra year for reimbursement. We're starting to pull some triggers on some mission-critical things, especially in the support of New York. That's a huge decision. As well as regulatory, we need more help on regulatory. And there's a few open territories. And there is - this is a good economy overall, right? And there is - there is attrition. There is some movement, not very big, but not outside what's normal, but there is a handful of positions that are moving to us. So, we're upgrading those positions as well. All in all, we feel pretty good about the trajectory and where we're at. The new leadership there running the business unit has been fabulous and watching things well. We have a great team there. The management is largely new, but they're six months to a year in now, starting to get their feet steady and it's going okay. I think I addressed most of it. Did I miss any of it? Dan Leonard : Well, your thinking on the FDA? Chuck Kummeth : Yes, on the FDA, yes, it is a bit - we were surprised to really get this FDA designation status. We're trying to actually talk to them more about what does that really mean, how are you really going to help us? Does it mean now or does it mean about bladder or the blood stuff? And they say yes on all fronts. They want to help. That's what it means. So, they don't make any promises, though, and it's kind of what you give them, they'll speed things up and grease things and help you and make sure things are correct from a data package or whatever. That's what we're told. But it doesn't just freely give you something. It's just - it's more of a momentum designation, I guess, that you'd need help on if you're going to speed up and move things into the market. We will submit sometime this year. We're not giving real dates around that. We have all the data we need. Our two studies provide everything we need to do all this, which is what we've been told. So, it's just a matter of filling out forms and packaging and submitting, but we're not providing any more of that for competitive reasons, but it is imminent. Operator : And our next question comes from Patrick Donnelly with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Patrick Donnelly : Chuck, maybe for you, just on ACD, continued a nice recovery in the quarter. Can you just talk through the strength there and then expectations going forward for that segment again? Knew it had the tough comps in the first half. How should we think about it going forward? Chuck Kummeth : It's back up to a year ago. After this blow-out earn-out, we realized we had to dig in and find out just how much pull-forward in the things they did that really beat their earn-outs. So, I was a little scared that next quarter or two and things kind of flattened out and there wasn't a lot of growth. And wondering, Jesus, are we doing something wrong or is this not as big an addressable market as we thought or what. And, boy, the more we dug in and more we got in the field and we personally got in the field and we went out there and dug in. It really was nothing like that. This is still a $1 billion plus market just for the IHC movement to molecular pathology. Then there is the whole drug discovery side of things. Then there is the whole Diagnostics side. We're just still scratching the surface. We had record performance this last quarter with Leica, our partner. They are building a whole new set of indications with us. We're in renegotiations. They want a longer-term, deeper relationship. This now extends to Danaher, the parent, which we know quite well and we all have friends there. We're all a small industry, of course. And it's all going pretty well that way. We're really happy to see almost mid 20s percent growth here, both these last two quarters. We see it continuing. And that's really not fully understanding what is the potential now with China as we staff up, which we're now doing. We're staffing up heavily for China. And we'll see. Europe, as you know, a couple of quarters ago too was a kind of a redo. There was definitely a lot of - as we mentioned, an overhaul there three quarters ago. And that's firmly now on the ground again. The growth has been fantastic. As I told you, we expect probably 20 plus percent growth. And if we don't get it, we'll make changes because it's - the market is there, the product is real. This high-plex product we just launched will do over $1 million its first year in the market. We have a relaunch of BaseScope. DNAscope, which we've been waiting on for a couple of years, has made some great progress. We expect to commercialize that near the end of this fiscal year. That gives us a whole another host of applications and partners that have been begging for this. So, this is another platform. It's going to be big. So... Patrick Donnelly : Okay. I know you touched on the M&A - Chuck Kummeth : Tissue certainly gold standard, right? You can't get away from tissue. Liquid biopsy is all coming and we're all chasing with different platforms, but tissue is still king. And this is a solution that's best out there for tissue analysis. Patrick Donnelly : And then, I know you touched on M&A briefly on the cell and gene therapy side, but maybe just more broadly, can you just talk through the M&A pipeline you're seeing out there, how active you expect to be given the leverage ratio? Chuck Kummeth : Well, we were pretty active this last year and we're still hunting. As I mentioned, there is some cell imaging, the leukapheresis component and the bioreactor component. Those are three - there may be another one or two, but we're getting close to not needing much else. But if we can buy them, we'll buy them. Everything else is kind of new. If they are not very big, you're going to pay a big multiple. But they're not materially big. More than likely, they won't sell the best ones. And we're lining up - we've got collaborations of which we're in the middle of some right now. So, trying to get them done. But as I mentioned, even without them, even selling just GMP proteins, it will be a great business. you see us start tacking on the polymer beads, the Quad, the B-MoGen transposon - and by the way, the gene editing component is a very lucrative component. And as we get transposon built into the minds of these researchers, away from viral vectors, it's going to be - it's largely unknown how big that could get right now. But we'll see. But we're hunting. That's exactly what we're hunting. We're not looking for another leg in this dual platform, like a ProteinSimple or ACD right now. We're looking for really building out this cell and gene therapy as the next major growth platform for the company on top of ACD, on top of Exosome and on top of our core reagent, which are all growing. Operator : And our next question comes from Alex Nowak with Craig-Hallum Capital Group. Please go ahead, sir. Alex Nowak : Chuck, do you have any competitive entrants within instruments to disrupt that continued strength in your automated Western blot or the automated ELISA systems? Chuck Kummeth : No. We're still alone. We're doing great. Simple Western is just killing it. So, we're trying not to be too bullish about it. But over 1,500 instruments already. So, it's there. And we still think that we're under 15% penetrated. I don't think we'll ever get over 50%. I think there are just a lot of small labs that still are going to do the hand Westerns. But in 10 years, this is going to all go the way of the calculator. This is the way students are going to be trained and no one is going to be doing these stupid things by hand anymore, wasting two days of time. So, it's all great there. Simple Plex, it's the sleeper in our company. This Micropoint deal all by itself is $50 million plus, maybe $100 million. There is a lot of immunotherapy going on in China. They are seeing a lot of cytokine storm. They want monitoring systems. This is a real company built by the guy who built Mindray. He's investing heavily, going into clinicals. It's a great robot. It uses our systems. He has done the panel for us - all for us. They've got great labs. They've qualified everything. They're dealing directly with the China government which they should. They're Chinese; we're not. And I'm really surprised, quite frankly, we haven't seen a whole lineup here in the U.S. to do the same thing. I think there are other solutions out there that are similar with this, Quanterix being one, but it's the size of a battleship. But we've got next generations of this technology with increased sensitivity and we think we're going to win there too. But it's really kind of a two-horse race in sensitivity, us and Quanterix, and there is just so much opportunity for these automated immunoassay type of solutions. So, the new cartridge, the 32x8, is a Meso Scale killer, we think. The ink is still wet on these things. We've just launched it, but there is going to be an awful lot of interest in that solution being a Complex 8. And remember, this plex, there is no crosstalk. It's zero crosstalk. Four orders of magnitude of signal to noise. It's one hour from sample to answer. It's the real deal and it's not that expensive. It's benchtop. So, it could be the sleeper. We'll see. The question you didn't ask is around iCE. And iCE, there is definitely competition. And it's come back. It's relatively flattish this last quarter. But, overall, the year, it's pretty modest come back. We have - we're coming out with new generations of that here soon. We'll have it on the Empower platform here, this next quarter, which is a big deal to be on the Empower system in the manufacturing environment, so these large customers, which has really become a requirement. So, that's finally done. And we'll just have to see. But it's a big space. And I've got to mention too. What we discovered - and some of this lull is - it has to do a little bit with the migration of these large customers also moving from their classic pharma molecule-driven approaches to cell and gene therapy approaches and biosimilar approaches and bioprocessing approaches. And as they're staffing up for their own cell and gene therapy, which is driving a big part of this, they are looking at different methods of their testing. And guess what, the iCE platform, it works really well to be involved in the workflow of testing for cell and gene therapy. So, we're expecting that to become a big evaluation promise this coming year and they've already started. So, I do think we're going to see extra growth from that in the coming years. It is also part of the cell and gene therapy workflow. So... Alex Nowak : And then, just following up on Europe, are any of the challenges there more macro based and expected to last into fiscal '20? Or do you view most of the challenges in Europe this quarter as just tougher comps and timing of orders? Chuck Kummeth : It's mostly that we think. I think the days of 13% to 15% growth are behind us. We were taking a lot of share, building out new subsidiaries. But I think high-single digit growth is still there. The cross-selling, the synergies we have, the portfolio we have, that's the kind of growth we're expecting. And I think in macro, I think Brexit is the biggest risk. We're certainly going to get a hard Brexit now with Boris in place. Again, it's not a really big issue for us materially, but it might have a leakage effect across all Europe. We'll just have to see what happens. We can affect that. And whatever happens to us, it will happen to everybody else. But for the last three years, we've been kind of ahead of the pack, ahead of all our peers in terms of our results. And I don't see that changing too much. We're going to be right there. Alex Nowak : And just last question for me. Congrats on the draft LCD for EPI. That's a big win. Jim, if you just took - I know you don't want to get too specific, but if you just took the volume this quarter, take the percent to be covered by the LCD and annualize it, what's a rough range of revenue we should be expecting over fiscal '20? Jim Hippel : I know - all I'd say is this. Our test counts, we've been talking about our test counts the past couple of quarters. They did increase sequentially from Q3 to Q4 by roughly 7%. So, it gives you a sense of where the test count is. We've said before that roughly half of that test count population is Medicare - will be Medicare covered once we get CMS. So, really, in terms of how much of that revenue we recognize in fiscal year '20 will depend on the timing of the actual final draft and resolution, which right now they've stated publicly they are expecting it in December. And then, it will be a cash recognition lag of up to 30, 45 days beyond that. So, our models don't show showing significant revenue from EPI until the second half of the year. But as Chuck mentioned, it could be earlier if that final draft approval comes out sooner. If we're - obviously, we'll appeal for tests that were done prior to that release effective date and the timing and the resolution of those appeals could also impact the year positively. Right now, we haven't assumed any of that actually in our numbers for fiscal year '20. We're assuming that the appeals process will take longer and would likely be a fiscal year '21 event. Hopefully, that helps. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Paul Knight with Janney. Please go ahead, sir. Paul Knight : What will be the capital cost of the St. Paul facility? When do you think it also will be kind of fully online? Is that like Q4 next year? And then, what's your thought beyond that project? Chuck Kummeth : Well, it's roughly a $50 million total that's spread out over a couple of years. So, it's majority this year, but it all depends on the timing, how we're doing. We're not breaking ground. It is a building we're purchasing. So, it's about retrofitting this building with the new equipment. There are some long lead items. There are lyophilizers and larger, high-grade, really, really complex centrifuges, et cetera, that are over a year in lead times. We've already had those orders in. We expect probably somewhere October to December next year we'll be through our initial qualifications and be issuing lots to customers. It was originally designed to be a September of next year, but we certainly lost a couple of months in the permitting process here in Minnesota, et cetera. But we're still largely in the game. So, think of it over the next two years of roughly $50 million. What's after that, Paul, is hopefully - we've just got to build another one because there's so much business, we can't handle it all. The site is big enough, by the way, for expansion, the building as well as the land. So, we could - I wouldn't say double it there, but we can probably get a significant increase to the capacity should we need it two, three years out. Paul Knight : And then, regarding ProteinSimple, I know Simple Western, you said grew, what, 50%. But I'm trying to - what did all of the ProteinSimple platforms together - what was their combined growth in the quarter? Chuck Kummeth : Yes, we don't give it out anymore, Paul. But for the segment, we gave you the segment, but you can - the information we've given by these major categories, you can kind of - you can kind of get a guesstimate. It's a good number. Paul Knight : What, you're probably 5% to 10% maybe of the Western blot market now? Chuck Kummeth : We think we're 10% at least. We are underway - we've made a comment of under 15%. It's hard to know for sure because there is a lot of gray area there in where labs draw the line of needing an instrument or not and just they doing them by hand, but it's a billion-ish kind of market. 1,500 instruments so far. And you look at other types of platforms in these kinds of labs and we're 10% of that probably. Imagers would be a good example. You look at all the imagers out there, tens of thousands, right? Paul Knight : I would guess that everybody who doesn't have one right now wishes they did. That's great. Thank you. Jim Hippel : They can still get one. Operator : And it appears there are no further questions in the phone queue at this time. Mr. Kummeth, I would like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks. Chuck Kummeth : Well, great. Thanks, Dorrie. We are top of the hour and I appreciate everybody having a long list of questions and participating in this call. We'll be back next quarter. So, thank you. Operator : And this does conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Tables reconciling these measures to most comparable GAAP measures are available in the Company's press release issued earlier this morning on the Bio-Techne Corporation website at www.bio-techne.com. I'll now turn the call over to Chuck. Charles Kummeth : Thanks Dave and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter conference call. We started fiscal 2020 on a strong note with our first quarter organic revenue increasing 13% year-over-year continuing a double-digit organic growth rate we delivered in fiscal 2019. The double-digit growth was broad across our product segments and geographies with proteins, antibodies, simple Western, and RNAscope platforms performing exceptionally well. Also rebounding from last quarter our OEM diagnostics tools business contributed to double-digit growth. As we look at our performance by geography I will start with Europe. In Q1 organic revenue increased over 10% for the quarter. As expected the headwinds we faced last quarter normalized and contributed to the strong performance in the quarter. Recall that the timing of a large order from a European customer was one of the headwinds we experienced in this region last quarter. During Q1 we received this order. Excluding this large order our European growth was in the high single-digits and this is our expectation for the remainder of fiscal 2020.  The initiatives the European team have put in place over the past several years continue to positively impact the business creating synergies across divisions and implementing creative ways to make it easier for our customers to do business with us. We believe these efforts create the foundation for continued European growth ahead of our industry peers in quarters to come. That said the popular view regarding Europe is fairly bleak about an economic slowdown there so we will continue to monitor Europe closely for any signs of weakness.  With regards to North America organic growth was also north of 10% driven by particular strength in biopharma. There's been a lot of efforts dedicated to our digital market strategies including the continued enhancements we make to our website which allow customers to do complex product searches and find solutions for their research needs. However, our digital marketing efforts go well beyond our website with our search engine optimization efforts increasing brand visibility and driving traffic to our website. These efforts are translating into double-digit increases in our Bio-Techne web traffic which correlate very strongly with the double-digit revenue growth we have been seeing especially in our antibody and protein portfolios. We view these digital market initiatives as a key component of our forward growth strategy and are very pleased with the continued progress through this important channel.  For China organic growth of nearly 20% for the quarter with continued strong performance in both our reagent and instant products. The life sciences industry is still a high priority in China's five year plan and we continue to be well positioned in spite of any local competition and are still very under penetrated in our key growth platforms.  Now let's dive a little deeper into performance of our growth platforms starting with those within the Protein Sciences segment which grew 13% organically for the quarter. As I've already indicated, antibodies and proteins performed extremely well for us in Q1 with both product categories growing in the mid teens in the quarter. In addition to our digital marketing efforts we recently began the process of validating a growing number of our immunohistochemistry chemistry antibodies using ACD branded in situ hybridization and gene editing platforms leveraging a transcriptomics approach to providing high quality validated IHC antibodies for researchers. This initiative leverages across in organizational synergy between our reagents solutions division, our genomics division, and our recently acquired B-MoGen Technologies. For background as the number of antibody suppliers has increased over the years the process of validating the quality of numerous antibodies from various suppliers has become increasingly more challenging for customers. There are no rules or quality standards that an antibody reseller must abide by before selling an antibody. Customers are increasingly asking for assurance if an antibody has been tested and shown to be specific for cells known to express the protein in question and not bind the cells where the gene editing, excuse me, where the gene encoding a specific protein has been knocked out. We anticipate this multiomic approach to antibody validation to distinguish the quality of R&D systems and Novus Biological branded antibodies from our competitors provide superior service to our customers and ultimately benefit our antibody sales.  We also continued to position ourselves as a tools provider for the coming wave of cell and gene therapies. While still a relatively small portion of our business today, cell and gene therapy will be very important growth driver for our company in the years to come. With our GMP proteins polymer B technology in non viral vectors and instrumentation to automate process and product monitoring we can now supply a significant portion of the cell and gene therapy workflow. This potential is already evident in our GMP proteins business where we experienced growth over 100% in Q1. We broke ground in our new GMP dedicated protein factory in the quarter and we will be ready to provide GMP proteins in larger scale to our cell and gene therapy customers by the second half of fiscal 2021.  Moving on to our instruments portfolio within Protein Sciences where the simple Western platform continues to be the star of the show. With an installed base of over 1600 worldwide and growing double-digit we saw consumable growth from these instruments that was over 40% higher than last year. Further evidence of these instruments are quickly achieving market acceptance. They are not just getting installed they are getting used. As I mentioned in my opening comments our growth in Q1 was balanced between both of our operating segments with the diagnostics and genomics segment also growing double-digit in the quarter with 16% organic growth. Here the OEM diagnostics tool business returned to double-digit increases in nearly all of its major product categories including clinical controls and specialized reagents. As expected the OEM order timing was more positive in Q1 than it was in the last quarter Q4.  Also our glucose controls business stabilized in the first quarter of our fiscal year with sales relatively flat year-over-year. Going forward we expect this division to be at least a mid single-digit grower for all of fiscal 2020 with possibly higher growth in future years as new diagnostic instant platforms and assays by our OEM customers come online. Also within the diagnostics and genomics segment RNAscope continued with its growth recovery with sales increasing over 20% in Q1. During the quarter we released the RNAscope high flex assay which enabled researchers to gain greater insights into cellular mechanisms and functions by combining a simple workflow with the capability of simultaneously detecting up to 12 RNA targets. The high flex assay is particularly well suited for spatial genomic studies with the assay requiring minimal sample preparation while delivering high performance and preserving the morphology of precious tissue samples. It is still early in the RNAscope high flex assay launch but we believe this will be another growth driver for our genomics portfolio.  Now let's discuss our liquid biopsy business Exosome Diagnostics. Of course the big news here in Q1 is that NGS our Medicare Administrative Contractor issued a final local coverage decision or LCD covering EPI for men who are being considered for an initial prostate biopsy. This major reimbursed milestone is effective for EPI tests administered for Medicare beneficiaries on or after December 1, 2019. Importantly with this final LCD more than 60 million Medicare beneficiaries will now be covered for the EPI tests.  During the quarter we also made progress with private payer coverage of EPI. We currently have nearly 30 commercial plans contracted for EPI as well as 38 states covered under Medicaid. We expect a recent Medicare coverage decision to drive increased awareness of EPI within the private payer community and look forward to updating everyone on additional contract wins going forward. Following these reimbursement or regulatory milestones we are positioned for an acceleration in EPI volume. All test counts in the most recent quarters were 34% higher than last year, we use the seasonally slower summer months to revitalize our marketing message and strengthen our sales leadership so that we are well positioned to garner doctor patient acceptance of the EPI test as a viable alternative potentially unnecessary prostate biopsies. With over a million unnecessary prostate biopsies performed every year just in the U.S. we couldn\u2019t be more excited about serving what has been until now a very unmet need. In summary we are off to a great start in our fiscal 2020. The second fiscal year of what we intend to be many years of double-digit growth. Our core reagent portfolio is performing at its best in over a decade while our adjacent proteomics and genomic analytical tools are still ramping in very under penetrated markets. Meanwhile our liquid biopsy and cell and gene therapy platforms are still in the pregame show of what we believe will be a long non-inning with many home runs. That's a strategy we are marching to and I'm very proud of the Bio-Techne team and their accomplishments to date. With that I'll turn the call over to Jim. Jim Hippel : Thanks Chuck. I will provide an overview of our Q1 financial performance for the total company as well as provide some color on each of our segments. Starting with the overall first quarter financial performance, adjusted EPS was a $1.06 versus $0.98 one year ago with foreign exchange negatively impacting EPS by $0.25. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.37 compared to $0.45 in the prior year. The biggest driver for the decrease in GAAP EPS was the change in fair value or investment in ChemoCentryx which negatively impacted the GAAP reported number by $0.26.  Q1 reported revenue was 183.2 million, an increase of 12% year-over-year with organic revenue increasing 13%. First quarter reported sales include a less than 1% growth contribution from acquisitions and a 1% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange translation. By geography the U.S. and Europe both grew north of 10% while China grew nearly 20%. As for the rest of Asia organic growth was in the mid teens. By end market which excludes Asia and our diagnostics division biopharma increased in the low teens while academia increased in the mid single-digits. Moving on to details of the P&L total company adjusted gross margin was 69.5% in the quarter compared to 72% in the prior year. The decrease was due to unfavorable product mix, some factory absorption timing, and to a lesser extent the impact of recent acquisitions and foreign currency headwinds. Going forward we expect adjusted gross margins to be comparable to fiscal 2019. Adjusted SG&A in Q1 was 29% of revenue relatively flat compared to the prior year while volume leverage was offset by additional SG&A expense from acquisitions as well as investments in our core business to support growth.  R&D expense in Q1 was 8.8% of revenue, 30 basis points lower than the prior year primarily due to volume leverage. Recall that the Exosome Diagnostics acquisition closed at the beginning of August 2019. So our Q1 2019 included only two months of related Exosome Diagnostics expenses whereas Q1 2020 includes three months of their expenses. The resulting adjusted operating margin for Q1 was 31.8%, a decrease of 210 basis points from the prior year period. However excluding the extra month that Exosome was included in our results this year as well as the negative impact of foreign exchange, adjusted operating margins was flat to last year.  Looking at our numbers below operating income, net interest expense in Q1 was 5 million relatively flat with the prior year period. Our bank debt on the balance sheet as it is in the Q1 was 486.1 million down from 505.2 million at the end of Q4 2019. Other adjusted non-operating income was essentially zero for the quarter compared to 0.8 million of other expense from the prior year quarter primarily due to differences in transactional foreign exchange. For GAAP reporting other non-operating includes unrealized losses from our investment in ChemoCentryx.  Moving on down to P&L, our adjusted effective tax rate in Q1 was 21.9% and we expect the adjusted effective tax rate to remain in the range between 21% and 22% for the remainder of the year. Turning to cash flow and return of capital 40.5 million of cash was generated from operations in the first quarter and our net investment and capital expenditures was 10.5 million. 12.2 million of dividends were paid out in the quarter and average diluted shares to 39.3 million shares outstanding.  Next I'll discuss the performance of our reporting segments starting with the Protein Sciences segment. Q1 reported sales were 141 million with reported revenue increasing 12%. Organic growth was also 12% with foreign exchange having unfavorable impact of 1% on revenue growth and acquisitions contributing 1% to revenue growth. As Chuck previously described, the growth in this segment was very broad across almost every major product category and geographic region. Operating margin for the Protein Sciences segment was 42.2%, a decrease of 100 basis points year-over-year due to unfavorable mix and factory absorption and to a lesser extent unfavorable foreign exchange and the recent B-MoGen [ph] acquisition. Turning to the diagnostics and genomics segment, Q1 reported sales were 42.6 million, an increase of 16% from the prior year. Organically revenues also grew 16% with a 1% growth contribution from the extra month we owned Exosome Diagnostics this year offset by a 1% on sale impact from foreign exchange translation. As Chuck mentioned the contribution to growth in this segment was fairly balanced in the quarter with OEM diagnostic orders swinging quite favorably compared to last quarter, our more run rate haematology controls business growing double-digits and our genomics division continuing on its track back to consistent double-digit growth.  Going forward we anticipate less volatility from our OEM diagnostics business and anticipate mid single-digit growth in this division for both next quarter and the full fiscal year. With regards to Exosome Diagnostics and as I stated in prior calls revenue from EPI tests performed is being recognized on a cash basis. This is the correct accounting treatment given its recent commercial launch and relatively low penetration of contracted payers. For patients insured by non-contracted private payers the appeals process for payment by using insurer order patient can be quite long. Thus the revenue from EPI recorded in our Q1 results was rather minimal.  As Chuck mentioned we received the final favorable local coverage decision from Exosome Diagnostics Medicare Administrative Contractor NGS. After December 1st we anticipate submitting claims to Medicare for tests on covered patients. We do expect there will be a 30 day lag between our submission of claims and the receipt of Medicare cash payments implying a minimal Medicare contribution to our fiscal second quarter EPI revenue. Despite the favorable final LCD we will continue to recognize Medicare revenue on a cash collection basis until we have a sufficient history of claims paid. We currently expect to switch from cash to accrual revenue recognition for Medicare claims to occur sometime in early fiscal year 2021.  Moving on to operating margins for diagnostics and genomics segment at 2.1% the segment's operating margin was down from 6.9% reported in the prior year. The decrease reflects the extra month of Exosome Diagnostics expenses compared to the previous year partially mitigated by strong volume leverage in the rest of the segment. Excluding the dilution from the extra month of Exosome Diagnostics Q1 operating margin for the segment was 9%.  In summary Q1 is played out consistent to the full year guidance we gave at the end of last fiscal year. As a reminder we discussed on last quarter's call that our plan was to grow organically this year in a 10% to 12% range and hold adjusted operating margins relatively flat while investing in our cell and gene therapy strategy. We also explained the impact of the extra one month ownership of Exosome was likely to have on our year-over-year margin in Q1 followed by sequentially improving margin in the quarters to follow. And finally we pointed out the unfavorable impact that foreign exchange was likely to have on the year-end rates.  We are very pleased with the strong start we had for the fiscal year. However we were helped some of the timing -- helped by some of the timing of the large annual European order that Chuck talked about in approaching science segment as well as a favorable OEM order timing in our diagnostic tools business. Plus even though we started the year with 13% organic growth we're still anticipating the full year to be between 10% to 12% range. We also still expect our adjusted operating margin for fiscal year 2020 to be relatively flat to fiscal year 2019. Going forward from Q1 the impact of Exosome Diagnostics expense is not being included in our baseline is behind us. At current exchange rates we expect the unfavorable impact from FX that we realized in Q1 to continue for the remainder of the fiscal year. And even though much of our planned cell and gene therapy investment is still ahead of us we expect to sequentially improve adjusted operating margins for the remainder of the year. That concludes my prepared comments and with that I'll turn the call back over to Nicole to open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Puneet Souda with SVB Leerink. Puneet Souda : Thank you. Hi Chuck and Jim. A strong quarter here, just wanted to get a view from you and what are you hearing from your biopharma customers overall as we head into the end of the calendar year, just give us a sense of what the demand flow is looking like and overall what's the expectation here, you commented a little bit about Europe, I would love to get more of a longer term trajectory how are you thinking about Europe and overall business in North America? And then I have a few follow ups. Charles Kummeth : Sure. I'll start with the worst of the pack probably Europe and it is kind of wait and see. So even though we started seeing some softness last quarter we had a really, really good quarter with Europe. But it was -- we are a couple knarlies [ph] as we pointed out. I think high single-digits for the full year is probably still the expectation. We could do a little better. We'll see, the instant side of our platforms is the biggest suspect. I think we're very strong in the reagent side and overall looking good. Asia is looking really strong for instruments and I think it's probably part of the buying cycles there as well. But we see really no shift or any anything coming down off especially in China. Things are looking really good and the U.S. is kind of steady as she goes. So we've been pretty, pretty stable in the U.S. and with the good news from NIH funding the piece came out last week and I expect next year should be okay as well on the academic side helping out the biopharma side but pretty steady.  I think we tried to put some commentary in and around our search engines and our web and I think we just came off of a very, very strong neuroscience show. We had more leads the first day than we had the entire show last year. So our booth has really come a long way, we've got all our platforms, our brands all showing up together now. It's creating an awful lot of interest in the Web, the Web keeps providing more. So I think that is helping fuel the way for a continuous strength in the U.S. which has been double-digits here for a while. So, that's kind of the way the three regions shake out for the instant side of things and as well as everything else. So, pretty good. I think Jim was right on, I think 10% to 12% is where we kind of peg the year. If we get a really good [indiscernible] launch here we'll see, it could be better but it's probably the range we're looking at to be safe. Puneet Souda : Okay, great. On the facility buildout, it is great to see that kicking off but what's the expectation here for gene and cell therapy workflow products two to three years from now and wanted to get a view from you on what are some of the pieces that you would still like to add into this gene and cell therapy workflow to enhance the product offering to the customers? Charles Kummeth : Sure. So, as you know we're looking forward with our cell and gene therapy workflow to be the non-viral methodology. We expect now -- almost everything in clinical is a viral method. We'll be supplying GMP proteins for that method. So we'll be getting business ready to shoot as we are today and we had a 100% growth in Q1 with our proteins. So we're looking good there. The factory by itself for GMP proteins is we're building it to $140 million plus in five years of productivity. It probably has expansion capabilities, very easily the $200 million of proteins. We probably will take more than five years to get that level of just proteins.  So from that respect we kind of look like a mini CDMO but there's the rest of the workflow with the beads and with the B-MoGen technology for gene editing. We have more than one instantiation platform for analysis both in cell imaging with the AC technology as well as our simple plex amino assay for called Casey testing if you will. So all told it's a pretty strong workflow. We still are looking for more areas to fill it out. I think we don't have a leukapheresis instrument to tie it all together. We have certainly relationships that we're working on to try and collaborate to get that part pulled into the workflow. That's probably the most critical piece I think, the box so to speak, the sterile box that ties it all together. The bio reactors of course are important. We have a very strong relationship locally with that and we have more than one and we have a bit of a secret weapon for that whole part of the workflow.  We have a product we've had for four or five years called Prodots [ph]. We're able to actually alkalize our proteins into small dry components and they can be shipped within the bioreactor or positioned with that workflow for reconstitution in a sterile environment with no loss of bio activity. So this is really unique to us. We have IP in this area as well and we are getting eyes wide open when our customers in preclinical have seen this approach and they want it. So we think we have a lot of things to offer that nobody else will have for the whole workflow. I think like you kind of implied it's going to take two or three years to get to that point. We're in a bunch of preclinicals now which will then lead to clinicals and it will grow from there but this is a 5 to 10 year kind of strategy and it's going to take a while to get to that level. But hey, whoever thought we're going to be able to more than double our protein business and we've been 30 years at it. So I don't mind taking five years to double it. Puneet Souda : That's great, thanks. And if I could just squeeze one more and I wasn't sure if you already provided, what's the revenue expectation around Exosome for the fiscal year and now that you have Medicare and could you talk about the plans for FDA or next steps now that you have breakthrough designation for EPI? Charles Kummeth : Yeah we've done the first submission and they've come back with a long laundry list of questions as expected. So we're not even really able to give a date when it will be finalized for FDA. But under a year for sure, but it's going to be a few months at least for that. So we're in process and the FDA breaks through stuff and gets us that help from them directly that they promise. So they are helping. So we'll see what happens with that. In terms of revenue we're right now are trying to figure out where to reach back to for our first submissions for tests previously done. We're trying to figure out what that date will be, it'll be in months and no longer than a year worth. So we're not prepared to give a number on that but it'll be millions of dollars worth of potential but there's no guarantee.  Going forward it's 40% to 50% of the tests and you kind of had that number and that ramps, you kind of guesstimate what we're going to be submitting. And although once we get everything greased here with CMS which I promise will be December 1, that's a 30 days to pay kind of future and then we'll go to accrual next summer probably at that, so after that amount of time frame. Revenue, you've seen the numbers. I mean we need a full year to get to a $30 million total and our run rate is about 50 million and at that point we're probably break even, that's going to be a 12 to 18 months kind of timeframe we think. But it's early and we don't really know yet, we got to see how this does ramp. We got to see how we execute. We've taken a long time here in the last few months to upgrade our marketing and our sales groups and we're still hiring. It takes six to nine months for the new people to get in the groove. We just hired out in New York so we won't be getting a whole lot of traction in New York for probably another three to six months. It all takes longer than you want but we're nearly the only game in town, it works the best of anything out there. We got this thing from start to finish through and yes, in two years or so we will say Telus [ph] is a record. It's still like a long time for us but we'll see how it ramps. But I think getting to a level of revenue that we've talked about is certainly more than just plausible so we're excited to try and feed this beast as we go forward from December 1st. Puneet Souda : Okay, thanks Chuck. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Catherine Schulte with Baird. Catherine Schulte : Hey guys, thanks for the question and congrats on the quarter. First one on that EPI Medicare look back topic. How's your discussions with NGS gone and when do you think you'll find out if you'll get those retrospective payments or not? Charles Kummeth : You just don't know. There is no precedent as you know, there's no real rule or law around it. It really is up to them what they feel is appropriate and fair. And we have to decide also what day to go back to and we can make it more problematic for us to get anything by the farther back we reach. So we're trying to pick a fair position where there's like notice no dispute, no doubt, and you got to remember when you start out this kind of thing you're starting out with sales people with unclear practices and processes and data and we don't want anything nebulous about what we're asking for. So we're going to pick a safe date where we have from a point where our processes are really clean and perfect and we have great data and great outcomes and so there is no dispute. So we're trying to figure that out but it's going to be an all we think at least six months worth and that should be a few thousand tests. So we'll see. And I hope they're generous. Catherine Schulte : Okay, and then for the upcoming quarter you have a pretty tough stacked comp in Protein Sciences. What's your view on that segment next quarter and what are you assuming in terms of the calendar year end budget flush there? Charles Kummeth : Yeah, we're not hearing much right now of budget flush. I mean the news that just came out for looking forward to NIH funding is kind of a record, it looks really good. So we're excited about this coming year of coming forward for academia. As I mentioned in my previous answer I think things are pretty steady as she goes with the rest of the business. We'll see how all our processes drive execution. But it's like you said it's a tough quarter. This is -- we're coming into a quarter with a really good one for us last year and we don't think we're going to let anyone down horribly. But it's going to be a tough quarter. We've got to execute and that's the way this business is. Right, when you're staying -- you want to be sustainable and be double-digit every quarter going forward. They're never easy anymore. Catherine Schulte : And then last one from me, can you just give us an update on the general environment that you're seeing in China and what are you expecting for growth there for the full year? Charles Kummeth : Yeah, north of 20% for sure and we're trying to figure out ways to really be at 25%. So I think we'll be between 20% to 25%. Things look pretty good. The fifth year is kind of concluding there. There will be a bit of a budget flush there. I think all the pull forwards and all the trauma drama around tariff I think is behind us even though we don't have a lot of tariff impact anyway. And I think it's steady as you go. We still aren't that big in China. So it's just we're very under penetrated and it's led by institutions, hundreds of them that are more or less led by U.S. Chinese citizens that know our brands and went to school here and grew up with R&D systems in the lab. So we're all over it. And it's been just very stable and very solid since the day I got here over six years ago really. We're up to now 150 people plus in China. It was a dozen when I joined so we're becoming a real company there.  I made a comment to some groups last week, when I joined our RMD and our head of HR were the only ones that spoke English too and trying to hire people for a company that's a dozen people and 10ish million dollars it's hard. The multinational grab all the great local talent that are bilingual. And we're now past that, we've crossed that hurdle. We are -- most of our people who are hiring these days are rock stars and they not only speak English they're coming from the multinationals. They've grown up and they've been trained by somebody else and want to come on board because of our under penetration, our growth, our great platforms, the synergies they see, and the EPI culture we're trying to instill in every subsidy we have around the world. Catherine Schulte : Great. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Alex Nowak with Craig-Hallum Capital Group. Unidentified Analyst : Great, good morning Chuck and Jim, thanks for taking our questions. This is actually Will on for Alex today. Chuck Bio-Techne has built a huge catalog of products and resources for life science researchers, as you move into the GMP grade protein production how can you leverage these existing products and resources to make you successful in the emerging cell and gene therapy area, to ask the question another way is this another leg to the stool that needs to be added or can you leverage pieces of the existing businesses into this new growth area? Thanks. Charles Kummeth : Well, we don't need a very big catalog because we're talking probably about 10 products. So as you know our problem right now even though we experienced a 100% growth in our GMP protein business we're set up here for research, we are the research leader in the world. We have we have thousands and thousands of products and thousands of just proteins. And so we are spread a mile wide and inch deep and that's the fundamental issue. We have amazing quality with amazing processes here but it's not really GMP qualified because we can't make big enough batches to really operate for a production type environment for a CDMO. Alright, so they've all been through, they love us, they love what they see but you got to be I will make more of it is what we hear. And so we bought this factory, we're building it out, and we will be making what the world's looking for, for the next generation GMP proteins which are -- which is the food that these cell therapies are eating, right, basically and using for it to improve their yields. You look backwards the spec is kind of IL2 and everybody can make IL2. It's not a difficult protein to make. It's one of the first ones discovered and discovered by this company.  Looking forward we're looking at much more complicated proteins as the science gets stronger and we're looking at IL7, IL10, IL15 and others that we think will position us as the supplier of choice as you start moving towards more complicated proteins. We're the ones that are going to be we'll make the best and make the highest quality with the best yields with the highest buy activity. So we think the future kind of comes straight at us. It's kind of our solution, the number one protein science manufacturer in the world and that's why we are building this factory. It won't be a large catalog because it really -- it's not the way GMP proteins work for cell therapies. It's more of a select set. So there is going to be much more about what flavor of an IL10 do you provide and what kind of quality, what kind of lab activity, what kind of yield your customers get with their cell therapies with your protein that's the name of the game. Unidentified Analyst : Got it, thanks, appreciate the color. That's interesting. And then just what's the update on the ACD partnerships with LICA [ph] and if you could just talk on the next ACD tests in the pipeline and timing for some launches there, thanks? Charles Kummeth : Yeah, so we used to talk more about the pipeline and they've kind of guide us against that. So they have a good half a dozen things they're working on. There's a lot of things, a lot of them are smaller orphan like, they're very big unmet needs. The current business -- the HPV test is growing quite well. It's strong double-digit growth, we're very happy with how they're really prioritizing it. So I think our new management team led by Kim Kelderman I think has helped a lot. He comes from running Genomics for Thermo Fisher, has strong relationships industry so he's helped a lot with moving up the food chain so to speak in the Danner organization trying to get more priority on us and that's worked very well. So I think we're looking forward to be hopefully working with them on a number of things. They're not the only game in town; Ventana, Roche is also more and more interested in working on things with us and we're ubiquitous platform. It's a kit technology that can work on multiple instrumentation platforms. So we're working all the issues there so, and it's so far so good. It's still largely an RNAscope RUO based business right now and the diagnostic side is still less than 10% of it and you give us five years five years and it'll be much more than that. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, great, thanks. And then congrats on the final LCD for EPI, I just have one more question, do you have any updated plans to kick this product as well as roll out other Exosome Dx based tests in either a lab or a kit format? Thanks. Charles Kummeth : Well, we'll get the FDA breakthrough status and that'll help us -- or give us more freedom to do a lot of things plus create a lot more credibility with the private payers and such. But we don't see any real need to kick it out at this point. It could be that someday but there is plenty of uncharted territory for us right now to not worry about that. And yet remember we're also working now on taking in patients and starting the studies around the bladder indication and we've got kidney rejection rate to go and we have validated test ready to go to clinical with somebody who wants to work with us on the blood side for lung and for breast. So we've got a strong pipeline with this platform that we don't have to go after anybody addressing kitable version of it right now. There is enough to do. Unidentified Analyst : Great, thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Paul Knight from Janney. We're unable to hear you please check your mute function. Paul Knight : Hey Chuck, Paul Knight. Charles Kummeth : Hey Paul, how are you doing. Paul Knight : Good, could you talk about your GMP production facility expansion specifically timing but also will this be a footprint where you can add additional capacity around it once the initial investment is made? Charles Kummeth : Yeah and as I mentioned earlier some of that answer but to expand on it it's a 50,000 square foot facility. We bought a building so that we could save a year from doing a Greenfield somewhere else, that was the main reason we bought one. We bought it in St Paul proper. It was an absolute awesome facility for the way it's laid out for us. So we really just got to fill it with our stuff which is most of the money as you know. The stuff is expensive to put in there with the large reactors, all the sterile piping, the in and out rooms, the clean rooms, it looks like a small pharma factory, right. It's a bio processing factory is what it is. It is ready to go on Phase 1 to roughly $140 million of the capacity at today's kind of pricing goals. And with expansion easily the 200 million if we need to there's plenty of room still and that 50,000 that was not utilized. We will be doing other things too, there's possibly other reagents we can work on there, some antibodies possibly there. There is stuff we're looking at but there's also some room on the site land wise so we can build out if we need to. So this thing could be really big for us and we don't have to worry about buying another one for quite some time. Paul Knight : And then regarding protein simple your 1600 placements, is your pull through going up, could you talk about where you think you are in market penetration as well? Charles Kummeth : Well we are 10% less than penetration we feel. We have seen that no matter what's going on with the instruments or whatever it being simple western it has just been knocking on the park quarter after quarter. I think it's because we have more than crossed that chasm and it's still very under penetrated. We are bringing back into the fold a lot of big pharma customers that have walked away from a Western blot as a process and in the you are going back with us again because this works so well. It's so fast, it's so reliable. So we're actually expanding the market again I think. 1600 is a good number but it's roughly, if you look at it as I compare to what imagers are out there it's less than 10% of installed imagers in the world. So we think there's a long way to go. We are still in good split between biopharma and academia. I think we're not done until we really see people leaving college with this is how they learned how to do Western blots. When this is the methodology that's taught in schools and becomes a standard we'll know that our job is done and we're a few years off from that. Paul Knight : Okay, thank you. Charles Kummeth : We have no competition with this Paul. It's the only automated Western blot platform out there and we see nothing on the horizon. Jim Hippel : You have to keep adding to the library with your antibody probes. Paul Knight : You mean in terms of Western\u2026 Charles Kummeth : Yeah, so we're always adding right. So we add roughly 1500 a year, it is split up between antibodies, assays, and proteins each and every year. So we're the company people look to for the newest, hardest to make bio active proteins. We've always been the ELIZA leader and we still crank out new ELIZAs every year. We are pushing the envelope another assay especially multiplexing so we're trying to extend that category as multiplexing becomes more and more of a standard. And antibodies we supply a lot through Novus. We have in our catalogue over 300,000. We make over 20,000 ourselves but as you know antibodies come in all different applications and from western to flow to whatever and we're the largest catalog in the world. We're not the largest provider but we're in the top five. And we've seen double-digit growth for quite a few quarters now and we're enjoying it and we think it's going to continue. Paul Knight : Thank you. Operator : We have no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to Chuck Kummeth for any concluding remarks. Charles Kummeth : Well as our analysts move around from different companies we're expecting a few more analysts coming back online in the next quarter or two so that'll be good. But we've enjoyed all your questions and we're here today and rest of the day tomorrow for other calls and one on ones and reach out to David Clair if you have other questions you have but other than that we'll check in with all of you again next quarter. Thank you. Operator : And once again ladies and gentlemen that does conclude today's conference. We appreciate your participation today.",

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the call will be open for questions following management's prepared remarks. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. David Clair, Bio-Techne's Senior Director, Corporate Development. David Clair : Good morning and thank you for joining us. On the call with me this morning are Chuck Kummeth, Chief Executive Officer and Jim Hippel, Chief Financial Officer of Bio-Techne. Before we begin, let me briefly cover our Safe Harbor statement. Some of the comments made during this conference call may be considered forward-looking statements, including beliefs and expectations about the company's future results. The company's 10-K for fiscal year 2019 identifies certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements made during this call. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of any new information or future events or developments. The 10-K, as well as the company's other SEC filings, are available on the company's website within its Investor Relations section. During the call, non-GAAP financial measures may be used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. Tables reconciling these measures to most comparable GAAP measures are available in the company's press release issued earlier this morning on the Bio-Techne Corporation website at www.bio-techne.com. I'll now turn the call over to Chuck. Charles Kummeth : Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter conference call. Our organic revenue growth in the second quarter increased 6% year-over-year, although adjusting for the impact of certain timing headwinds, our underlying organic growth was closer to our year-to-date growth of approximately 10%. In Q2 of FY'19, we experienced some large favorable orders from a handful of biopharma customers who were launching clinical and/or preclinical trials. These large orders mostly impacted our Protein Sciences segment in Europe and were for Reagent big box instruments and related royalties that did not repeat again, in Q2 of this year. However, our end markets remain strong with our day-to-day retail business growing north of 10%, our Genomics RNAscope business still growing north of 20% and China also continuing to grow over 20%. Also, our team performed operationally very well in Q2 with adjusted operating margins expanding year-to-year ahead of schedule and we reported record operating cash flow.  Now, let\u2019s cover details for the quarter. Starting with our performance by geography, the North American market continues to be healthy with organic growth in the mid-single digits. Our growth in the region was low-double digit while academia grew mid-single digits. The region's overall growth was down with the timing of the royalties from our [indiscernible] customers. Including a one-time catch-up of royalty payments that benefitted the prior year quarter, excluding the royalty impact growth in the region was over 10% in Q2.  Our digital marketing efforts continue to bear fruit, especially for our retail antibody and protein portfolios, with our website driving a double-digit increase in website traffic across our brands, including over 20% increased traffic for our including Novus website year-to-date. We are implementing several initiatives to get customers to spend more time on our website and add items to their shopping carts once they visit us online. Search engine optimization and continual refinement of our website and digital marketing strategy remain a strong order for growth for the company going forward.  Separately, we continue to strengthen our presence at industry trade shows, showcasing our products and technologies that are expanding on Bio-Techne growth. With strong customer interest in our Reagent and insulin solutions offerings at the 12 trade shows we attended in Q2, and the eight additional industry trade shows on the calendar for Q3, including ACR and ADI conferences taking place in April and May, respectively. These trade shows represent a key part of our marketing strategy and generate significant marketing for the company. In fact, our leads have increased 75% upon the new investment this past year. Moving on to Europe, which was the largest drag on our growth in Q2, down approximately 1% organically from the prior year. Excluding the timing headwinds that impacted Europe, the underlying organic growth in that region was in the mid-single digits, which is the same organic growth rate for the first half of FY20. Not bad, but certainly lower than what our company has be accustomed to performing during the past couple of years. Latino Europe will be redoubling its efforts in the second half of FY20 on the cross-selling of double-digit growth the better part of the last two years. Our key growth platform such as Simple Western, Simple Plex and RNAscope are still relatively underpenetrated in the European market. In addition, we will be supporting a sales effort in Europe with more of the Digital Solutions practices that have driven the successful double-digit growth we've seen in our North American retail region businesses. Thus, we are expecting Europe sales to go faster in the second half of FY20 with growth rates at the target of the high-single digit level. Finally, we had another good quarter in Asia. China especially continued to perform very well with another quarter of more than 20% growth. The growth was broad-based across our Reagent and Instrument products. The Life Sciences industry remains a high priority in China's five-year plan and we continue to be well-positioned and very underpenetrated in our key growth platform. In the near term, the coronavirus situation will cause some disruption in Q3 with extended days for the Lunar New Year holiday and virtual quarantines in some Chinese cities. Obviously, the longer this virus disrupts their life throughout much of China, the more negative impact it will have on our growth rate for China. Long-term, it is unfortunate an incident such as this outbreak that will likely strengthen China's already firm resolve to promote heavy local investment in the Life Sciences phase for years to come. Now, let\u2019s dive a little deeper into the performance of our growth platform, starting with those within the Protein Sciences segment, which grew 4% organically for the quarter. As I\u2019ve already indicated in my opening comments, Protein Sciences growth was materially impacted by a handful of large biopharma customer orders in the second quarter of FY'19, as well as a significant royalty payment, none of which repeated in the most recent quarter. Depending on the customer and the application, these prior-year orders were a headwind to our Reagent instrument and royalty revenue streams in Q2. Absent these specific situations, the segment\u2019s organic growth was in the high-single digits in Q2, led by our run rate Reagent instrument consumables products in the low-double digits in the quarter.  Within Protein Sciences, we recently made a very important leap forward in position in Bio-Techne as a leading tool and solution provider for the production of therapies. In January, we announced the creation of a joint venture between Bio-Techne, Fresenius Kabi, and Wolfe & Wolfe, a consortium that can offer a complete and simplified sell of gene therapy solutions. We believe the combination of our collective sales and marketing efforts, enormous count, technical know-how and knowledge create the potential for significant commercial synergies. By combining the novel engineering solutions offered by Fresenius Kabi and Wolfe & Wolfe with our GMP proteins, polymer T-cell activation, non-viral vectors and assay technologies, the joint venture is positioned as a sell in gene therapy production market. We are very excited to get this initiative off the ground and there has already been great interest in the gene therapy community. Over the next year, while this new commercial consortium continues to drive awareness of our gene therapy solutions and placement of our products in increased clinical trials, we continue to work on our new dedicated GMP protein factor. Construction remains on track to provide GMP proteins in large scale for our gene therapy customers by the second half of fiscal 2021.  Now shifting to our Diagnostics and Genomics segment, which grew 12% organically during the quarter. Here, the OEM Diagnostics tools and control business grew mid-single digits overall, with growth in most of its major product categories. As expected, following double-digit growth in Q1, the OEM order time was less favorable in Q2 than it was last quarter, although new customer wins and product launches are starting to smooth the large quarterly flames in this business. Also, our genomic RNAscope continued with its 20%-plus growth trajectory in Q2. The initial Q1 launch of the RNAscope HiPlex assay, which enables the simultaneously detection of up to 12 RNA targets, ramped nicely in Q2. We are currently developing additional HiPlex capabilities to address additional Genomics studies, targeting significant increases from our current 12-plex capabilities. Stay tuned for more product announcements. Now an update on Exosome Diagnostics and the ExosomeDx prostate test. There were several positive developments in Q2, and there is still much to do to make this -- make sure this noninvasive prostate cancer test becomes available to all patients over 50 with elevated PSA levels who are contemplating a more expensive, risky, painful and invasive tissue biopsy. To begin, the final [indiscernible] from NGS went into effect December 1. Since then, we have been billing Medicare for applicable patient tests since, and are already seeing payments come in. However, the LCD language administered by NGS did not near the coverage recommended by guidelines. For example, the final LCD does not allow for Medicare reimbursement more than once per patient for ongoing monitoring, nor does it allow reimbursement, for certain ethnicity with -- and then with certain family medical histories. Of course, these calculations were included in our clinical studies, with outcomes consistent with the overall study. The NCCN recognized these population sets can benefit from the ExoDx Prostate Test, and we are working to make sure NGS does too. Thus, we are currently in the reconsideration process with NGS to near the Medicare coverage with the recommendations of the NCCN guidelines. In the meantime, early rate -- the early rate that tests meet the Medicare criteria is encouraging and we will continue to work to expand the indication over the coming months. For ExoDx Prostate Test administered to applicable patients, we have been billing Medicare and getting paid. We're starting to see Medicare payments on submitted claims as early as late December and the pace of payment has increased rapidly throughout January. We also made progress on the private care front in Q2 with four more regional insurers, contracted to reimburse ExoDx Prostate Test uncovered patients. Although the base is still relatively small, our collections from target payers increased by more than 40% sequentially since Q1. While we still have work to do to get the large national private payers signed up for reimbursements. The national payers are taking our meetings with great interest. They are becoming more aware of the health benefit to our customers and plausible financial benefits to their bottom line by avoiding more costly biopsies as well as the unintended infections that can result from them. However, they are being very careful and methodical with regards to reimbursement for our test. Before considering reimbursement, many large private payers want to see the results from a clinical utility study published in a peer-reviewed journal. Exosome Diagnostics performed such a study before our purchase of the company. It was conducted in collaboration with CareFirst Blue Cross Blue Shield of Maryland. This study has been submitted for publication with a peer-reviewed journal and should be released before the end of our fiscal year. Separately, we are in the process of submitting our premarket approval of PMA filing to the FDA. We call it the ExoDx Prostate Test with the breakthrough device designation from FDA at the start of the current fiscal year. It is difficult to predict the exact timing of the potential FDA approval, but achievement of this status will deepen our competitive mode and allow us to have higher priority for reimbursement from private payers who classify few made products with higher quality. Equally important as getting paid for the ExoDx Prostate test is expanding awareness of the benefits of ExoDx and rapidly increasing test performed on applicable patients. Since the start of this fiscal year, and while we have waited for Medicare coverage, we have slowed any new commercial investment into sales and marketing. Instead, we have focused on retooling our go to market strategy and ensuring we have the best commercial talent to execute on that strategy. Even without much new commercial investment, the number of Exo Diagnostic Prostate Tests performed in Q2 grew double-digits sequentially through Q1, as well as double-digit year-over-year.  Going forward, our commercial strategy will include marketing to the patient directly, in addition to urologists. We want to make sure patients are fully aware of our non-invasive options available to them, to assist in the determination of their risk of prostate cancer before deciding whether to proceed with a painful biopsy. We believe the best and most cost-efficient channel for awareness is digital marketing and events. In Q2, we launched a redesigned Exosome Diagnostics website. The new website features portals for patients and physicians, scientific literature, and information on the benefits of our ExoDx Prostate Test. We will be coupling this enhanced website with digital marketing efforts by leveraging the proven effectiveness of our digital solution team\u2019s expertise to increase awareness of patient demand for ExoDx. These search engine optimizations and digital marketing efforts aren\u2019t yielding earnings, but we anticipate this campaign, combined with the recent regulatory reimbursement milestones, will favorably impact ExoDx Test lines by creating patient demand. We remain on the pathway for growing ExoDx buy-ins and are excited to enable men with ambiguous PSA scores to avoid unnecessary prostate biopsies. With a pipeline of additional tests, companion diagnostic applications, and partnership opportunities, there are several different avenues to create value with Exosome Diagnostics. We have a few partnerships in place and are in discussions with several pharmaceutical companies, of potential companion diagnostic applications of Exosome\u2019s diagnostics technology. We also believe our proprietary Exosome-based technology has broader diagnostic applications, including improving performance of existing pipeline tests from other diagnostic companies. In summary, fiscal 2020 remains in good shape. We delivered year-to-date organic growth of nearly 10% and are still aiming for double-digit growth for the fiscal year. Our coreagent portfolio continues to perform very well, while our adjacent proteomic and genomic analytical tools are still ramping in very underpenetrated markets. Meanwhile, our liquid biopsy and cell and gene therapy offerings remain in the very early stages of realizing their potential, with each representing true transformational opportunities for Bio-Techne. Our competitive position has never been stronger, and the team is driving toward even better execution of the second half of fiscal 2020. With that, I will turn the call over to Jim. Jim Hippel : Thanks, Chuck. I'll provide an overview of our Q2 financial performance for the total company and provide some additional color on performance of each of our segments. Starting with the overall second quarter financial performance, adjusted EPS was $1.08 versus $1.06 one year ago. With foreign exchange negatively impacting EPS by $0.08. Most of the foreign exchange impact was due to transactional effects for invoices collected in Euros by our U.K. entity, which serves as our European commercial operations headquarters. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $2.02, compared to $0.45 in the prior-year. The biggest driver for the increase in GAAP EPS was $120.5 million combined realized and unrealized gains on our investment in ChemoCentryx. Q2 revenue was 184.9 million, an increase of 6% year-over-year on reported and organic basis. Second quarter reported sales include a 1% growth contribution from acquisitions and a 1% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange translation. By geography, the U.S. grew into mid-double digits while Europe declined low single digits and China grew over 20%. As for the rest of Asia, organic growth was in the low single digits. By end market, which excludes Asia, our diagnostics division and other OEM customers, biopharma growth was in the upper single digits, while academic growth was in the mid-single digits. Moving on to details of the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin was 70.6% in the quarter, compared to 70.9% in the prior-year. The decrease was due to unfavorable product mix, foreign currency headwinds, and to a lesser extent, recent acquisitions partially offset by productivity gains. For the remainder of fiscal 2020, we expect gross margin to remain fairly consistent with these levels. Adjusted SG&A in Q2 was 28.6% of revenue, a 70-basis-point improvement compared to the prior-year. This volume leverage and productivity gain, partially offset by investments in our core business to drive near and long-term growth. R&D expense in Q2 was 8.9% of revenue, 20 basis points lower than the prior-year, primarily due to volume leverage. The resulting adjusted operating margin for Q2 was 33.4%, an increase of 90 basis points in the prior-year period and 160 basis points higher than our first fiscal quarter results. Looking at our numbers below operating income, net interest expense in Q1 was 4.5 million, decreasing 1 million compared to the prior-year period. The decrease was due to a substantial reduction of bank debt during the quarter. Our bank debt on the balance sheet Q2 stood at 383 million, down from 486 million at the end of Q1 fiscal year \u201820. Recall that Bio-Techne has been a long-term shareholder of ChemoCentryx, a biotechnology company with a portfolio of novel therapeutics, targeting a variety of orphan diseases. In our Q2, ChemoCentryx reported favorable top-line data from a stage III trial of avacopan in antibody-associated vasculitis, or AAV. This favorable data release drove significant appreciation in our ChemoCentryx investment, and monetized approximately $50 million of its gains. During the quarter, we applied these proceeds, as well as a portion of our strong free cash flow, to pay down $103 million of our long-term debt. Other adjusted non-operating expense was 2.5 million for the quarter, compared to 1 million of other income in the prior-year quarter, primarily due to the impact in transactional foreign exchange. The GAAP reporting other non-operating income includes realized and unrealized gains for our investment in ChemoCentryx.  Moving further down the P&L, our adjusted effective tax rate in Q2 was 22%, which we expect to remain fairly consistent for the remainder of the year. Turning to cash flow and return of capital, a record 72.5 million of cash was generated from operations in the quarter, driven by strong customer account collections and favorable timing of tax payments associated with our realized gain on ChemoCentryx. Our Q2 net investment in capital expenditures was 14.6 million mostly driven by construction of our new GMP protein factory, which is on schedule for completion by the end of the calendar year. $12.2 million of dividends were paid out in the quarter, and average diluted shares to the 39.6 million shares outstanding. Next, I'll discuss the performance of our reporting segments, starting with the Protein Sciences segment. Q2 reported sales were $141.5 million with reported revenue increasing 4%. Organic growth was also 4% with foreign exchange having an unfavorable impact of 1% on revenue and acquisitions contributing 1% to revenue growth. As Chuck previously described, growth in this segment was negatively impacted by last year's timing of a few large biopharma orders and OEM royalties that did not reoccur in Q2 of the current year. Absent these items, revenue from the thousands of other customers that Protein Science served increased nearly 10%. Operating margin for the Protein Science segment was 43%, a decrease of 50 basis points year-over-year due to unfavorable foreign exchange and the recent B-MoGen acquisition Turning to Diagnostics and Genomics segment, Q2 reported sales were 43.8 million, an increase of 12% from the prior year. Organically, revenues also grew 12% with foreign exchange translation having a minimal impact on revenue. As Chuck mentioned, our OEM Diagnostic Tools business increased mid-single digits and our Genomics RNAscope business grew north of 20%. With regard to Diagnostics, as I stated in prior calls, revenue from ExoDx prostate tests performed continue to be recognized on a cash basis. As Chuck mentioned, our favorable local coverage decision from Exosome Diagnostics Medicare administrative contractor NGS became effective for tests performed on or after December 1. Despite the effect of LCD, we will continue to recognize Medicare revenue on a cash collection basis until we have a sufficient history of claims paid. Chuck provided a thorough update on the process we made on ExoDx test ramp, public and private reimbursement as well as the continued actions we are taking to accelerate both. While still on a relatively small base, revenues from Exosome were up nearly 60% from last year and we expect the growth rates to improve from here. Moving on to the operating margin for the Diagnostics and Genomics segment, at 2.2%, the segment's operating margin improved from a negative 2.7% reported in the prior-year. The increase reflects favorable volume leverage and productivity gains from both our Diagnostics and Genomics divisions, as well as slightly less dilution from Exosome Diagnostics. In summary, we believe our year-to-date performance in the top line is most representative of how the majority of our business performed in the second quarter. The commercial focus we are taking in Europe can set us up for even better organic growth in the second half of fiscal year 2020. However, the situation in China with the coronavirus is a risk factor that we are unable to quantify at this time. That being said, our teams throughout the rest of the world are motivated to maximize the potential in order to achieve double-digit growth for the company's overall fiscal year. On the bottom line, our culture of success-based investing and operational prowess drove our adjusted operating margin in Q2 higher over prior years ahead of schedule, and it drove a strong quality of earnings of selected operating cash flow. We expect our operating margin to continue to increase sequentially from here, just as we guided at the beginning of the year.  That concludes my prepared comments. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question with Puneet Souda with SVB Leerink. Please go ahead. Unidentified Corporate Participant : It\u2019s Chuck. Thanks. So, my first question, I mean look, I appreciate the biopharma comparisons that were tough in Europe, but you commented about some recovery here in the quarter. And could you elaborate a little bit on that? And what's your expectation for continued improvement here for -- in Europe? And what's your outlook, given the last sort of two-plus years of the strong growth in that geography? Charles Kummeth : Sure. I'll give kind of a long answer here because I'm sure everyone wants to hear about European analysis. As we kind of messaged last quarter, things are softening, and it didn't disappoint on that, for sure. But it was really kind of a lumpy mess. There's not really any one distinct thing that\u2019s kind of off. Some things are up and some things are down. Our biggest by country is Germany. U.K. is kind of flat, but Germany is pretty hard down. It\u2019s a lot of timing, a lot of biopharma, a big comp off on Genomics because of a big order timing issue there we mentioned. In the instrument, which are the biggest areas, we had a huge comp from Austrian Simple Western, so it came in kind of flattish. So, without that growth, it was hard to pick up. We already knew we were kind of up and down on biologics. Biologics didn't have a horrible quarter, but not great and this is probably the area we\u2019ve seen the most comeback already this quarter in biologics. It\u2019s pretty good already. Simple Western has got tough camps going forward, but I think as underpenetrated as we are, we\u2019re pretty bullish on it still going forward. And Simple Plex is also a big timing issue with a major order. We had another timing issue this quarter, as well, with Simple Plex, but I think the growth rate, especially instruments, is very encouraging and we\u2019re really focusing now on getting more consumables to drive behind those instruments. So, all-in-all, there is definitely a snapback coming there and off a pretty weak quarter for the instrument side.  On the Reagent side, it\u2019s really kind of a different academia in biopharma, and one up, one down. We're relatively okay, really, in terms of our Reagents. This is another area we've been in the past up and down on our assays. And Elisa is definitely down in Europe right now. So again, these biopharma projects are kind of in a slump right now, and for us, that\u2019s just kind of a weaker period. We ever focused a lot on this. We have a little competition here. And as you know, we have ABKIN coming out after and the bio has a line of products. And others are twined with the two. And it\u2019s not really what you\u2019d say is a growing market. And you have multiplexing really taking all the new growth. So, that's kind of up and down, but we don't see a huge impact, to be honest. They've got their piece, we've got our piece. So, it\u2019s just kind of overall kind of mediocre for right now for the timing in that. And that\u2019s a big chunk of our overall sales in Reagents and its selected matters. It\u2019s actually in that ASD right now for their division, but it also took down our division numbers. But that, too, I think will recover. And again, we had huge one-timers on royalties. And we have -- when we started putting these royalty situations in place two, three years ago, we had the ability to do third-party audits. And last year, we went through all these audit cycles and there were from big misses and some big payments. And those are not recurring this year, so that add back is a big number all by itself. So, all-in-all that kind of explains Europe, explains the recovery we're seeing so far in instruments. And we'll see it happen. So, December was a fantastic month in Europe. It was really more of an October-November. And we'll see if we can continue. Unidentified Corporate Participant : Okay. Then if I could ask on ExosomeDx, I didn't catch the contribution in the quarter, if you provided that. When do you think you'll have an answer on the reconsideration for the first one-time use of the test? And, Chuck, I was hoping if you could maybe take a step back and give us a view of what are your priorities now, given this acquisition? Now two years into this acquisition. And, Jim, if you could remind me, what are you baking in terms of operating margin impact, if any, from Exosome this year? Charles Kummeth : Yeah, okay. Well, as mentioned, we're using this time to really get our kind of ship in order. So, we've been upgrading our commercial force, getting our website ready, creating patient demand and staying in our guide rails, really, for dilution. And we are really ahead of the game there, to be honest. We had some payments from Medicare come in, even in December, even though we had LCD in December 1. So, that was a really big precedent. We have put in place the PRF policy with the doctor signing, and that signature process has been very positive. And, of course, the fact Medicare took these pays and they\u2019ve been paying. And it's been ramping very quickly. We are expecting revenues this quarter in Medicare to be maybe as high as even $1 million from nothing last quarter. So, we're seeing a great ramp. It kind of is expected. So, we'll see what happens. Going forward, the priorities, of course, are as we ramp, we'll invest. We want to -- we really want to drive this patient demand. It's really important because it's just -- it's going to take a while for reconsideration and we're going to be needing for the levers. That reconsideration process, now we\u2019re talking NGS. This isn't the most friendly of all the macs and it's a next summer activity. And then we have to make the agenda for the meeting and everything else. We feel pretty good about it but again, they don't help you, they don't tell you anything. We've submitted. All they've given us is that they wish we'd had the utility study data along with the guidelines to study, which we were told was enough. So, the utility study is done, it's been done. And we're now getting it published. And with that, we'll knock two birds in a bush with one stone, one being the reconsideration process and the second being the national insured\u2019s. Jim Hippel : And what the margin front needed as pertains to Diagnostics, as we see the cash collection start to ramp here, as Chuck mentioned, we\u2019re already seeing it ramp here in January, the cost will not be ramping at the same rate that revenue is. But we should see less and less dilution going forward, although not profitable yet, see less and less dilution going forward from assays on Diagnostics. And that\u2019s why we have confidence in our operating margin continuing to increase sequentially from here over all the company. Unidentified Corporate Participant : Okay. And then if I could ask you, Jim, you provided a long-term view at the last Investor Day back in -- late in 2018. You were expecting 1.2 billion in revenue by fiscal year 2023, mid-teens organic growth, 40% op margin. Is that still in the line of sight, given some of the near-term challenges of Exosome and the European shortfall that you're seeing largely because of compares? So, just help us understand any changes in the sort of long-term outlook here. Charles Kummeth : There is no change in the long-term outlook. We just got through with our annual refresh of our five-year outlook strategy, internal strategy plan, and if anything, out the gate it gave us even more confidence in those numbers, looking outward. So, one quarter doesn't make a trend. But very specific identified items that cause some of the bumps in the road we saw in Q2. But in terms of the underlying markets, we feel like they're very strong. Our run rate and our reagents, like I said, from the other -- literally 100,000 customers we serve are still very, very sound and going the right way, so. And then you get the upside potential with Exosome and cell and gene therapy. It's still very large, particularly in the out years, two, three, eight years. Jim Hippel : Let me address this specifically around that. So we\u2019ll be back in New York this fall giving another update, which we do every other year. And the new five-year plan, we'll have a number like 4.5 billion not 1.2. If we look back a year, the 1.2, we sort of lost a year if you talk about Exosome Diagnostics. And that was in the numbers for this 1.2. But we didn't have any cell and gene therapy in those numbers. And there will be some cell and gene therapy by 2023 as well. But all in for 2024 five years out we're at 1.5 because there's a strong cell and gene therapy component. And we still are -- that message is 150 million or more hopefully with Exosome Diagnostics. So those two growth drivers are still intact. And of course, everything honest, it has to be as well. I mean, we have never promised more than mid-single digit growth in our core and we've been doing materially better than that. So there is some hedge in that 4.5, so we still feel very bullish about that kind of number looking our four and then five years. Unidentified Corporate Participant : Okay. Got it. Great. Thank you. Charles Kummeth : And remember, there's no acquisitions in that. That's organic, and it's likely we're going to do more stuff, so. Operator : We\u2019ll now take our next question from Dan Arias with Stifel. Please go ahead. Dan Arias : Morning, guys, thank you. Chuck, just to clarify on the timing-related items, I think I got you four points or so, is that a revenue bullish that you fully expect fully to capture in the second half of the year? Charles Kummeth : The one-off, the timing issues you're talking about or what? Dan Arias : Yeah. Charles Kummeth : Yeah, well, one is-- one was a big component with royalty true ups that aren't going to happen again. We\u2019re on track with our steady state kind of royalty payments and probably improving as our licensees\u2019 distances grow, we get more. Another big component, of course, is the OEM orders and stuff we talked about, and those will be behind us. And I think some of this timing as well and I think that will correct itself, so -- Dan Arias : Okay. Charles Kummeth : But all in, those one-offs around the order of being roughly $6 million. So it\u2019s like Jim said, it's over 3% all by itself. Dan Arias : Yeah. Maybe just to that point, I\u2019m just thinking about the instrument performance during the quarter but then also what you think you might have in terms of improvement in the back half for Europe. How does that translate to the 15% to 20% growth rate that you've talked about and that you've been in for the protein simple business that's embedded in protein sciences? Do you still think you can finish the year in that range? Charles Kummeth : I do. 15 anyway. I mean, we've been promising and talking, guiding to 15 for the last three or four years. We\u2019ve improved, maybe doing about 20. So this is certainly a -- I think there is some component of us going more direct in Europe and going after those accounts directly and probably having a couple years of more business. Now we have to focus much more on commercial execution, cross-selling, expanding our subsidiaries, fixing Germany. Germany is definitely too lumpy. We've got to get more critical mass there. It's smaller than the U.K. in size of business and that shouldn't be. We essentially have a sales office there and not enough critical mass. So there are things we're working on. If you remember I lived in Europe for years of my career and they're getting a lot more help deflanked. But there are a lot of great things too. We worked hard to get Genomics back on track in Europe and it is. And that's one example. ELISAs is lumpy, and it\u2019ll be fine I think. Our Simple Plex and other assay technologies are really doing okay. I think they'll provide extra growth in Europe. The 32x8 assay is an example, is a great assay with advanced multiplexing that can re-take on the other multiplexing competitors. And that\u2019s in early days in getting launched and getting going. That's another example. So all in all we still feel pretty good about the whole portfolio. Southern Europe, France, France is just doing great. I mean, since the acquisition of our distributor in France and creating our own subsidiary, we're had near double-digit growth. No loss there. The issues have really been around the U.K. and Germany, which I think we can deal with, so. Did I get all of your questions? Dan Arias : You did. A couple of quarters ago, you were talking about how you were looking forward to getting more analytics on the call, so maybe I'll take the opportunity to ask one more for you if I can. Just on the OEM business overall, how do you think visibility changes there, if at all, or is that just the nature of the beast for the foreseeable future? And then maybe just a big picture question on that point. Obviously, you're moving the Bio-Techne portfolio into new directions. So as you do that, how important are these OEM components to the overall business? And do you think there's a potential for some strategic actions if you thought that any of it was becoming less core or non-core? Charles Kummeth : Yeah, we studied some of that. So first of all, remember, we had a 15% growth quarter last quarter in that business. And usually we guide I think like a negative quarter after one like that which has always been the case. And here we are with positive growth again. So we talked about things moving out, and they are. The pipeline is getting better. We have big new accounts. Like Sysmex is an example that is getting us more and more business. We\u2019re doing some very strategic things with them. We\u2019re very bullish. And across the board, I think it looks pretty good. Glucose, the pain is largely behind us and fairly well contained, although it's roughly flattish for the future and mainly even price increase that's holding things okay. But it's becoming a smaller part of the overall. But we feel okay. But in the end this is a roughly a 30% out margin business. And on the market should we sell; it's a 12 to 15 kind of EBITDA kind of multiple. And we've tested this, and it's hard to get beyond that. And here we are with our multiple, so we're being paid at a -- we're being paid for that business in our portfolio, that\u2019s 30 times plus. It's hard to make it up by just spinning it off and selling it unless it becomes a drain on opportunity cost or strategic or something. And it just isn't. It's not a hard business. We have one salesperson. And these business leaders kind of do their own thing. It\u2019s a very key product, process and business. The customers are all mammoth; they're literally on two hands. The count. So, it's just not that big of a brain drain here at the company. And, yeah, it's a 30% out margin business, and now it\u2019s growing fairly well and we\u2019ve seen more things we can do with it. And there are synergies because we are providing diagnostic tools. It\u2019s extremely sticky. The San Marco unit of that business, it has 100 -- it participates in over 185 10-Ks. It's specked in. So the worst thing about it is the orders are all lumpy and large and to the big guys out there. And we're working at steeling that out and getting more of their wild share. And it's probably never been better. It's one of the good things of this quarter was that business, actually. Dan Arias : Okay. Okay. Appreciate that. Thanks for the comments, Chuck. Operator : I'll now take our next question from Catherine Schulte with Baird. Please go ahead. Catherine Schulte : Hi, guys. This is Ty on for Catherine. Just wondering if you could provide any update on how quad\u2019s doing relative to the deal model and maybe some comments on how many clinical trials it's in and what has been the customer feedback so far. Charles Kummeth : Yeah, well, the whole consortium, the whole JV has already been a really big success. We had -- at the latest trade shows that have been showing this off, we\u2019ve had immense demand and interest. We're involved in an awful lot of -- over a dozen preclinicals. We are being looked at everyday by more. One of our partners has been involved in over a hundred prequalifications, so this stuff's going to happen. The trouble is it\u2019s just-- It's going to take a while. The viral vector process is the process of record, and ours is non-viral. And we're moving that direction, and we're going to have a piece of it. It's going to be an everybody wins market as these valuations of, these Al Deverons of the world have shown for a while, so we're pretty pumped. Quad is on track, and we have our lease product. We have new products on the drawing board. We can modify the size and hold consistent size with our bead technology. And we're coming up with new ways to use this technology. We have a tech counsel approach in the company. We have the scientists of all divisions meet and huddle often. And we're coming up with a whole different set of ideas around different arrays, assays, et cetera as well. It\u2019s cool stuff, a lot of interest. It was never going to be, the big winner in cell and gene therapy as a possible division someday. We always talked about it being a $50 million or $40 million range five years out. And we see that very, very doable and possibly a lot more if we find other applications for it, so. Catherine Schulte : Great. And I know that you guys have said you're not really able to quantify the coronavirus at this point, but are you seeing any sort of early disruption thus far, any sort of qualitative comments on what parts of the business could or could not be impacted by a more significant slowdown or something that's more prolonged? Charles Kummeth : Yeah. Well, this is my 28th quarter as CEO here. And I don't think we've had a quarter under 20% in China. I'm sure this next quarter probably will if everybody continues to stay home. Nobody knows where it's going now. The incidence rate is moving on more of a linear trajectory than an exponential, and that's probably to a large effect that people are quarantined. So that\u2019s going to ride its way out. But I think we\u2019re a long way from anyone claiming victory that this is under control. There's a lot of risks as well. I'm pretty sure everyone will get a hall pass next quarter in China. I think there is a benefit to us. These kinds of events, these X factors usually create a stimulus to research. And we're already seeing interest and growth in some areas that we typically don't because of this. It's one of those unfortunate things. Probably not as good as being in the respirator mask business right now, but there's going to be a halo effect for all -- everybody in the fighting-disease business. But this quarter's going to be a tough one probably more than likely. Too early to say but our instrument business, I think will probably not suffer. And I should say also we had an exceptional start to the quarter in China in general. So that's going to give us a little bit of hedge there. But -- and instruments probably will suffer because that\u2019s not a run rate business. But our run rate businesses, if you're using proteins and antibodies at the bench, but you're not at the bench. You're at home in the kitchen; those businesses are going to suffer for this quarter. But it's a short-term thing. We\u2019re not worried about it. Catherine Schulte : Got it. Thanks, guys. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Jacob Johnson with Stephens. Please go ahead. Jacob Johnson : Hey, thanks for taking the question. On the recently announced JV with Wilson Wolf and Fresenius Kabi, can you outline or give us some more details on how this partnership will work? I don't know if you\u2019ve disclosed what your ownership interest in that is and then if you'd like to just order any potential financial impact from it as we look out over the next couple of years. Charles Kummeth : Yeah, sure. This has been nearly two years in the making. As you can imagine, a three-way JV is not easy to negotiate. And these are some powerhouse companies. I mean, Fresenius of course is a big one. And dealing with them has been challenging but good. The Kabi group within Fresenius is five, six years into this. They're a Lobos platform. Their glucose instrument is becoming a pseudopotential standard already. As I mentioned, it's already been tested in I think over a hundred accounts. It\u2019s -- They're ahead of the rest of us, really, in this consortium. So we really wanted to link up with them. And one of the big gaps of our total workflow, we have a lot of boxes checked off in our workflow, but having that box to tie it all together is a really important step. And there aren't too many out there. There\u2019s only a few. So we think this is the best one in the market. The design came off of the early leader with [indiscernible] and I think major improvements to the solution have been designed and proven. So we think it's great. Of course Wolf and Wilson has been a long time, early innovator in cell factories and cell, biocell processing. A brand and a company and a leader that punches well above its weight. I spent time in thermal, we all know John Wilson in this industry. And he's right here in Minneapolis. Our teams are very close. We've been friends for many years. And this is going to go great. It's not a test of JV in any way, so it isn't like we're losing the revenue. This is all going to be kind of off and they're in their garage somewhere working away. This is really more of a marketing kind of consortium, a collaboration. We all put in equal funding to drive the entity and we all keep our revenue. We all drive our part of the business, and it comes back home. There were a lot of things in the contract of how we stay married and long timeframes and milestones to hit. And there are certainly scenarios of possible exits and kind of cover all your bases for all of this if we\u2019re not happy. And how to do mediation. It's a very complicated contract for that, but that\u2019s what these contracts always are for JV, it's all about solving the what-ifs and small percentage outcomes that are negative. So, nothing's been negative, it's been fantastic. The leaders get along really great. This has been driven and is the brainchild, really, of Dave Eansor, one of our presidents and a lot of focus on this. You know, the CEO of the entity is Fresenius Kabi, an extremely bright young man who we have a lot of faith in. I think we have-- we are prepared to talk about what we're going to put in, I think it's around $3 million, and that's an annual number to put in for investment to drive our piece. It could change next year, and we\u2019ll have to see how the business is, but it's by no means intended to be any kind of sinkhole for costs or anything. So, it's very containable. We already are selling the course, and things are ramping. And I would say, you know, the other 20 are selling more than us right now and it could dramatically shift over three, four, five years out as things like GMP proteins and such become scalable, which we think we will. There are front end versus back end parts to the business, and even though we're driving the full work flow of being a non-viral approach and we are going to sell GMP proteins to everybody, including the viral vector approach. And we have a ton of interest in our factory and getting allocation, et cetera, and, you know, we're open for business, so\u2026 Jacob Johnson : Got it. That's helpful. And then, just the last question from me, you paid down some debt in the quarter, the balance sheet seems like it's in a really great spot, I'm interested in what you\u2019re seeing in your M&A pipeline right now. Charles Kummeth : Well, I sure wish I could take credit for being so insightful on ChemoCentryx, but the investment was made here about 20 years ago. We have a lot of faith in Tom Shaw, and they've had a lot of success recently, and I don't think we're done with it yet. So, we did monetize some, but on top of that, we almost matched that monetization with great collections and cash flow, and we took a hundred million off. We've been averaging around 20 or so million a quarter, and we're at 120 for halfway into the year already, so we're essentially a year ahead of our schedule. We're now right around 1 1/4 for leverage, so we have a lot of very good balance sheets and liquidity for doing more deals should we find them. We're going to stay on path with that kind of level of drawdowns that we indicated earlier. Jim, you want to comment further? Jim Hippel : Yeah, no, you spoke well on it. In terms of the M&A pipeline, it's as robust as it's always been, it's more about finding the right deals at the right price. And, you know, right now the ones that are more of greater interest tend to be smaller in nature like they have been more recently. But as you point out, our balance sheet is in the best shape it's been in a long time, so should a bigger deal make itself available, we'd be happy to participate. Charles Kummeth : And we are hunting and we're involved in--- the overt\u2019s probably smaller right now, but nothing's changed there. We're always in the hunt and it's--- as prolific as we've been in acquisitions, believe me, everybody lets us know what\u2019s coming up and what's potentially in the game for us to take a look at. But we're pretty focused right now. We've got a lot of homework to do. We definitely see Genomics coming back on track from a couple years ago when it went a little bit sideways on us. We\u2019re feeling really good about it. The HiPlex road map is phenomenal and we're going to have a DNA probe product come out soon. So, I\u2019ve never been more bullish about the ACD technology platform in the Genomics division as I am now. And, of course, it's been tough, but everyone told us it would be tough to get into diagnostics and liquid biopsy's no different and we've never been in better shape than we are now and there's also a lot of partnership interest as well. We're definitely not going to try to own this whole thing, so we are developing partnership and companion diagnostics opportunities as well as other liquid biopsy solutions that maybe we can help their ordinary rum ball recipe, so to speak. So, a lot of interest and we're going to grow this thing and we will get reconsideration, we\u2019ll build another map, we'll do something to keep growing the pipeline of new stuff, it's expensive, so we've got to stay focused on that and more than trying to find, you know, another leg on the stool than the big acquisitions, so to speak. So -- Jacob Johnson : Got it. Thanks for taking the question. Operator : [Operator instructions] We\u2019ll now take our next question from John Leonard from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. John Leonard : Thank you. So, you're coming up here against your toughest comp in the prior-year period of 15% growth in March \u201819, is there anything you\u2019d flag that was maybe one time or lumpy in that prior-year number that we should be cognizant of as we are modeling the forward period here? Charles Kummeth : Yeah. I've been waiting for you, John, and I'm sorry you coming back online now this quarter. But, insightful question. And I mentioned in my comments that we do have one more timing issue coming up in that Genomics space. As well as maybe a potential other one in the Simple Plex. These clinicals that go around Suplex are large cartridge orders and they\u2019re kind of lumpy. We do have some in that number. Nothing like the 6 million, though. So, probably about half of that. 2 million to 3 million is probably something we have to outcome.  So, yeah, it\u2019s going to be a tough quarter. I think we were 14% last year this quarter. So, it\u2019s a tough comp. We\u2019re not going to get much help out of China, obviously. So, I think you can add up all the results of all that. But nice recovery so far in instruments in Europe. We're all over giving them more help in areas like Germany. I think that's going to improve. Genomics is, if anything, getting better. I think we're in great shape looking forward there, so we've just got to -- we've got to, you know, there's always one-offs, you've got to find more one-offs. That's what you've got to tell your team, you know? It is a reason, but it's a poor excuse for not showing growth, right? So, we've got to find more big deals, we've got to find more OEMs, we've got to find more key options, like Sysmex is a great example. We have very little Sysmex business, but it's coming on strong for us, as an example so... John Leonard : Okay, that's helpful color. And then my follow-up for Jim. Jim, it sounds like from your comments around gross margin that you're expecting full-year gross margin might decline about a hundred bips year-on-year. If that\u2019s so, what's the driver of that? Secondly, do you still expect that EBIT margins could be about flat year-on-year? Charles Kummeth : Yeah, so in terms of gross margin, yeah, it's a combination of mix and FX, that's the two biggest drivers in that order, having the overall year-over-year gross margin slightly down. But, you know, as the guide at the start of the year, we thought we\u2019d be roughly flat operating margins for the full fiscal year. And given our first half performance here, we\u2019re actually ahead of that plan. I won\u2019t go as far as guarantee that we\u2019ll be increasing margins year-over-year, but still flat year-over-year is definitely looking much more easily obtainable and hopefully there\u2019s up side. Jim Hippel : I want to say one more thing on that, too. It hasn't come up much, but the revenue looking like it is, and you add back that transactional SF, we\u2019re essentially on consensus. The operating excellence of our business is on our ability to look midway in this quarter and start to do the right things like good operation leaders do, because we have a very experienced team running these divisions and running these units. They've done an exceptional job and that's why we had the margin result that we did. And I feel confident we're going to be right on track, as Jim says, to our goals and our -- the guidance we gave for annual for our margins year-end. I think the revenue is harder than the bottom line. Can\u2019t always predict the top line, but you can predict how you\u2019re going to finish the bottom line, and we\u2019re doing a pretty good job, I think, of managing our costs. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Please go ahead. Patrick Donnelly : Great, thanks, guys. Chuck, maybe just a follow up on the M&A questions. What areas make the most sense to add to inorganically? I know you guys obviously talked a lot about areas like cell and gene therapy. And how far down should we go on that front? Just curious what areas you think are acceptable? Charles Kummeth : There's that famous da Vinci caricature that everybody tries to use in cell and gene therapy, and all the pieces of that workflow, which are a good dozen or more. And with our JV consortium, we've got most of the boxes checked. But there's some -- there are some areas, yeah, I think we could do more to help differentiate that the world is searching for. I think spatial-based Genomics, single-cell Genomics in a spatial capacity is a big area. It\u2019s going to -- there's still a lot of innovation happening there. A lot of small companies are making a lot of progress. We\u2019re looking at a lot of ideas there. I think reporter systems is another area. The major parts of the workflow, I think, are covered, but there are some things that could help us differentiate, as well. And, of course, we don't have a viral vector approach. I mean, we could always go more towards where the mainstream is right now, too, should we find an opportunity that made sense. And then we're going to be partnering with a lot of these CROs, so that could be a lot of opportunities. I think that covers the M&A in that direction. I think -- I still don't see us expanding in the podium -- our podium beyond where we are into like say NAFTAC or HPFC or NMR, things like that. That's not us. There's a lot of competition, it's hard to really be the kind of margins that we'd like to be in to go that direction. But, again, close to spatial measurements, single-cell analysis, next-generation flow, these solutions that use antibodies with their synergies of us all make sense. So, we're always hunting those directions. We're always in the hunt for expanding our portfolio. They\u2019re smaller but we have -- we're arranging for an NFL. We have whole cell applications now. There are -- Elisa areas out there that are chunky in nature that expand our assay portfolio. Those all make sense. Smaller antibody companies, should they be there for us at the right price. There\u2019s a few in Europe we like, as an example. They are always interesting to us. Patrick Donnelly : That's helpful. And then just a quick one on ACB. I think Jim mentioned it got right sized. What\u2019s the right growth number here? Is it kind of 20%? And what are the key drivers there? I know you have things like DNA probes coming out. But just talk to the drivers and that growth level there. Charles Kummeth : Yeah, the right number is 20%. Of course, we're going to push them for more. But the number for you is 20%. And I feel really bullish, because RNA scope is still way underpenetrated. We are still building our relationship with LICA, and the numbers are being dramatically better. We are working with Ventana, as well, at this point. We are looking at other lower-end instant partnerships, or a way to do things to try and go after that lower-level, mid-level hospital or pathologist that really wants to move from IAC antibody world to molecular pathology. I think there's a big opportunity there. So, we have a lot of interest in that. Our new design basecoat application is finding growth, The DNA scope will come out end of this fiscal year, which we know there\u2019s a ton of interest in. This HiPlex is just getting off the ground and we just filed, as we\u2019ve been talking about for a quarter or so. A new extension to that HiPlex technology that\u2019s going to get us into the multiples of 12 into targets. You start looking at an assay kit-based approach that can give you single-cell revolution for 40 to a hundred different targets at a time, that becomes really, really interesting to a lot of big companies out there in this space. So, that's all coming. So, I feel very good about 20%-plus going forward for years. Patrick Donnelly : Appreciate it, Chuck. Charles Kummeth : And if we flip, we'll make changes because it should be that. Operator : Your next question is from Alex Nowak of Craig-Hallum Partners -- Capitals Group, excuse me. Please go ahead. Alex Nowak : Great. Good morning, everyone. Just a follow-up to a couple of questions on here. Just taking into account the European weakness here, the one-time order time and the Corona Virus in China, is double-digit organic growth here possible over the next two quarters? Or should we be expecting something more on the lines of a high-single digit number? Charles Kummeth : Well, as you know, Alex, we don't give guidance. We're still on track for 10% or better for the year. But we have been guiding over the years saying an 8 to 12 kind of a range we want to be in, and we kind of moved that guidance this year for maybe 10 to 12. But your comments may be prudent that it may be an 8 to 12 for this quarter, given these headwinds we're looking at. The China alone, if we're 2025 moving to say 10 or 15 because of the virus, you can do your own math. But I'm sure it's going to shave a point, I would think, off of the potential we could do this quarter. Everyone's in the same boat. But, you know, and it's a tough comp for us, the toughest we've ever had. So -- but overall, the business looks pretty good in most categories. And Europe's coming back pretty well, our instant business interest is a good uptick. We mentioned North America is pretty strong. We've got 75% year-over-year lead increases. Our marketing, our commercial engine is just so much better than it was a couple years ago. And we're spending -- we\u2019re spending on more ad words. We\u2019re getting a $10 to $1 on investment on SEO. So, I\u2019m telling this team keep spending until you get an antidote and we haven't found it yet. So, for some reason we\u2019re seeing double-digit growth in both proteins and antibodies across the board, especially in North America. We\u2019ve got to get more of that going in the quarter in Europe, which we will. Asia's doing great, Japan's in a good spot, India is accelerating high-double digits. And China will take a blip here, but it will just be a blip for a quarter, I'm sure. Alex Nowak : Okay, understood. And then on -- just to go back on Europe here, I understand the issues in the quarter and they\u2019re one time, but you had mentioned a softer environment in Europe now for a couple quarters. I'm just curious why next quarter here? Why should that turn and start to become, actually, a better geography for you? Charles Kummeth : Well, some of its one-off, some of its serendipity, some of it\u2019s the way these timings on these projects are. We\u2019re just seeing an uptick in these platforms again. But I think they\u2019re still a risk. We\u2019re not out of the woods, I don't think, in Germany overall. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re out of the woods yet on ELISA in Europe. Our other areas like dual sets, most products are doing pretty well. We are definitely selling an awful lot of bulk, and that usually kind of comes and goes in cycles. But I think the biggest thing is we have to get down to basics with our sales force country by country, going off of and building off of the acquisitions we did. And then we started working -- getting people to work together and train them and teach them what Bio-Techne is and doing the cross-selling, I'm not happy yet. I think there was -- there was more growth around picking off low-hanging fruit from going direct from depending on distributors than it was about true cross-selling good growth. And we're also, I think, weak in our inside sales, weaker than we are in the US. We\u2019re going to need to beef that up. Inside sales for our model is very important. You can depend on your web, and, oh, that's great, but when you're selling over a quarter million different SKUs, and it's a catalog business, you've really got to have a strong inside sales group, as well. And we need to work on that, also, in Europe. So, there\u2019s a lot of levers we're pulling, but there\u2019s a lot of levers we're going to add and pull harder on. And that\u2019s why I have a little more renewed faith that we can get Europe going again. Now, Europe -- this was a bad quarter, and we've mentioned it for a quarter or two, as you mentioned. I think the couple years we were at 15% to 20% growth I think that's going to be a reach. But this getting back, as Jim said, to high single-digit growth where Europe should be is, I think, very, very, you know, possible and it should happen. It may take a quarter to get there but I think this quarter will give it a good shot. Alex Nowak : Okay, understood, that's helpful. Just real quick, you mentioned progress around partnerships Exosome. If any of these projects are successful, when should we expect a second Exosome Diagnostics test and then, any update on plans to kit the EPI test? Charles Kummeth : Yeah. We\u2019re already focused on kitting this, per se, right now. We are going after FDA approval, but not as a stand-alone non-doctor associated kit. We won't be on TV anytime in the future, okay? Is the one thing. The demand we're creating around direct marketing and web and SEO is going to be pretty dramatic. I think it's going to help a lot. We are moving on getting patients and starting the studies for both bladder as well as kidney rejection, and of course, they\u2019re off urine, so it's not that hard for us to do. And we're working on partnership ideas to get going on the plasma side. So, both the lung and the breast indications which are validated, we think they work and are ready for clinicals. So, I think we're looking at a couple years, maybe under two years, for the urine-based one, depending how they go. Again, we have to get studies written and get them included and it would depend on the timing of that. Probably picking a bigger Mac wouldn't hurt. A little quicker Mac. So, there\u2019s some decisions to make. But one half to two years is the short answer for you, but if you look at five years we're going to have a half a dozen things and hopefully a half a dozen partnerships as well so... Alex Nowak : Understood, thank you. Operator : We're going to take our next question from Paul Knight with Janney. Please go ahead. Mr. Knight, your line is open. Mr. Knight, if you'd like to ask a question, your line is open. That seems to be all the questions we have. I'd now like to turn it back to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks. Charles Kummeth : Well thanks. We appreciate all the interest. Overall a decent quarter, not as we had hoped but I think we have our hand in all the right levers and I think it's just fine for our year end. So all good going forward. Our team is pretty energized. There is a lot of great stuff happening here a lot of great finds and we're excited about it. So forward to talking to you more next quarter. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to David Clair, Bio-Techne\u2019s Senior Director, Investor Relations and Corporate Development. David Clair : Good morning and thank you for joining us. On the call with me this morning are Chuck Kummeth, Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Hippel, Chief Financial Officer of Bio-Techne. Before we begin, let me briefly cover our safe harbor statement. Some of the comments made during this conference call may be considered forward-looking statements, including beliefs and expectations about the company\u2019s future results as well as the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and financial results. The company\u2019s 10-K for fiscal year 2019 identifies certain factors that could cause the company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements made during this call. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of any new information or future events or developments. The 10-K as well as the company\u2019s other SEC filings are available on the company\u2019s website within its Investor Relations section. During the call, non-GAAP financial measures may be used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. Tables reconciling these measures to most comparable GAAP measures are available in the company\u2019s press release issued earlier this morning on the Bio-Techne Corporation website at www.bio-techne.com. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Chuck. Chuck Kummeth : Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter conference call. This has been an extraordinary quarter. First, I want to thank all the employees, suppliers and partners of Bio-Techne for their exemplary service as we have worked through the COVID-19 pandemic. We are happy to report that we have no coronavirus cases in any of our global sites and implemented proactive safety measures very early in the crisis in February to protect our employees. Our balance sheet is sound with a very strong cash position and low leverage. We have not conducted any restructuring or furloughs to date, easing the minds of our employees and enabling them to focus on serving our life science research customers and clinical diagnostics partners. While COVID-19 negatively impacted our business this quarter, primarily due to the temporary shutdown of academic labs, we are playing a critical role in the global fight to develop tests and cures for the virus. Overall, we were having a very strong Q3 until the virus pandemic had a pronounced impact on our business in mid-March. But even so, we ended the quarter with 6% organic growth. Adjusting for the impact of coronavirus in the quarter, we estimate our organic growth would have been closer to 9%. Our team also delivered incredibly strong operational results in Q3, with adjusted operating margins expanding year-over-year by 130 basis points to 36.5%, ahead of schedule and with strong cash flow. Now I\u2019ll get into some details of the quarter. Starting with our performance by geography, the North American market was very strong with low double-digit growth organically in the quarter. Biopharma growth in the region was over 20%, while academia increased mid-single digit. In general, both end markets were impacted by COVID-19-related shutdowns starting in mid-March, although our academic market experienced a disproportionate negative impact from the virus. The good news is that these are academic labs, not large industrial manufacturing lines. As researchers return to the lab and get back to work, we anticipate utilization of our consumables will snap back very quickly. Overall, biopharma research activity has been less impacted by the virus, with many labs continuing to operate at varying capacities. I don\u2019t believe we are alone in our belief that once this pandemic is under control, life sciences research will likely increase significantly. It appears everyone in society from governments through the private sector now knows what an antibody is; this can only be good for our industry. With current stay-at-home policies, many of our customers are spending much more time \u2013 of their time online. Therefore, we continue to focus on our digital marketing efforts that have driven significant increases in website traffic across our brands over the past couple of years. Search engine optimization, continual refinement of our website and digital advertising will remain a growth lever for the company going forward and will be even more important as a differentiator in the current pandemic environment. We have never done more webinars and digital projects to reach out to our customers. For example, we recently held an Exosome Diagnostics webinar for urologists, many of whom are working from home now and had over 100 participants. Moving on to Europe, which was positioned for a sequential recovery until the virus hit, finished the quarter with revenue down from last year by 7%. Here, we had a very strong quarter in Biologics as well as with our Simple Plex platform, which is seeing strong growth in COVID-19-related patient care decisions by monitoring cytokine storm onset and progression. However, this strength was not enough to offset the March shutdowns in academia, which especially impacted our Simple Western, Genomics, assay and reagent businesses in the quarter. It is still uncertain when European labs will begin to open back up, but we\u2019re expecting this to be country-by-country process. So far, in April, our German business is showing signs of an initial recovery, with Italy potentially not far behind. Our largest business is in the U.K., which is likely to be a month or so behind Germany in the recovery process. Finally, we had a surprisingly strong Q3 in Asia. Given the complete shutdown in China in late February, we were prepared for a quarter of negative organic growth in this country, but finished with positive organic growth in the mid-single digits. This fantastic finish reflects the outstanding work done there by the local team. Our employees in China are back to work serving \u2013 servicing a research market that has largely turned back on and expecting to revert to their long-term trend of double-digit growth in Q4. The rest of Asia also performed extraordinary well in Q3 with growth in the mid-teens. However, many of these countries, including Japan, Korea and India are currently in varying states of lockdown and expected to remain so for most of Q4. Accordingly, we are expecting double-digit negative growth outside of China in Q4. Before I turn the call over to Jim for the financial review, I would like to provide some more detail on the initiatives that our company is working on to help our customers develop tests and find remedies for COVID-19. I will also provide an update on some of the strategic growth initiatives that will have the largest impact to our company for years to come. Starting with our COVID-19 initiatives, we are experiencing significant demand in ramping production of our proteins and antibodies used in coronavirus research, including reagents that are components in serological assays. Also, we are working with several health care providers in perfecting antibody assays using the traditional ELISA platform that can detect an individual exposure profile to COVID-19, something that many health experts believe will require mass testing before world economies can resume any sort of pre-COVID-19 normalcy. Also, as I mentioned in my commentary regarding Europe, we\u2019ve experienced significant global interest in demand to leverage Ella as an automation tool for the detection and monitoring of COVID-19 patients that are potentially experiencing cytokine release syndrome. This dangerous condition represents a critical and potentially fatal point in disease management. In our Genomics division, we are supplying COVID-19 RNAscope Pro for virus detection in tissue, allowing researchers to confirm the organs that are impacted by this virus. And in Exosome Diagnostics, we have validated and preparing to perform COVID-19 real-time qPCR testing at our labs in both Munich, Germany and Waltham, Massachusetts. Following the implementation of processes and instruments to automate the test, we\u2019ll be capable of processing over 200 samples a day and we can ramp further after that. This lab-developed test will provide rapid and reliable detection of patients with active COVID-19 infections. These are just a few examples of how practically every division of our company has pivoted resources to find innovative solutions for COVID-19 and participate on a global level to help eradicate this horrible virus. We are uniquely positioned to provide reagents and assays for all aspects of COVID-19 research and diagnostics, and our mission thrives in helping solve these types of problems. Next, I will provide an update on two of our important strategic growth platforms, cell and gene therapy as well as Exosome Diagnostics. Starting with cell and gene therapy, we continue to make progress on the construction of our new dedicated GMP protein factory. Construction of the facility remains on track to provide GMP proteins in large-scale to our cell and gene therapy customers by the second half of fiscal 2021. We are very encouraged by initial interest in demand from biopharma customers as we actively market our coming GMP protein production capabilities and capacities. In fact, during the quarter, we executed our first large-scale GMP protein supply agreement. This customer is still making its way through the regulatory approval process for its therapy, making the GMP protein with a revenue likely in fiscal 2021. Many other customers have been engaging us with interest in long-term supply agreements to ensure continuity of supply for their present clinical studies and to meet their future commercial needs. In the meantime, our GMP portfolio has been growing at a rapid pace with a number of immune cytokines being used to grow cells in clinical trials. Also within our cell and gene therapy business, we have begun operationalizing the joint venture with Wilson Wolf and Fresenius Kabi that we announced last quarter. As a reminder, this commercial consortium offers a complete and simplified cell and gene therapy workflow solution using products from all three parties. During Q3, we focused on establishing a unified sales structure, a customer-facing website and point-of-sale and creating impactful marketing collateral, featuring all three parents\u2019 offerings. In addition, the emerging interest in natural killer cell therapies for oncology has been demonstrating some great clinical potential. And the JV is well positioned for the renewed natural killer interest, leveraging our GMP proteins, cloud, media and PC buster platforms for cell genetic engineering of difficult to grow natural killer cells. Now an update on Exosome Diagnostics and the ExoDx prostate test. There were several positive developments in Q3, and there is still much to do to make sure this noninvasive prostate cancer test becomes available to all patients with heightened PSA levels who are contemplating a more expensive, more risky and painful tissue biopsy. Following the final local coverage decision, or LCD, from our Medicare Administrative Contractor or MAC, National Government Services, NGS, we have been billing Medicare for applicable patient tests and are receiving steady reimbursement for tests submitted to this important payer. Recall that our \u2013 we are currently preparing for the reconsideration process with our MAC, NGS to get the LCD more accurately mirroring the more inclusive NCCN Guidelines, which will expand the potential market size of the test. Based on our prior experience, we anticipate a public comment period to take place in the summer, followed by a final LCD in the fall. Continuing on the reimbursement front, we announced the receipt of an unlimited 10-year reimbursement contract with General Services Administration or GSA, making the ExoDx prostate test available to more than 140 government entities, including the Veterans Administration health care system. Our conversations with private payer community continue to progress, but many payers want to see a clinical utility study published prior to issuing favorable coverage decisions. We expect such publication in a leading peer-reviewed urology journal within the next couple of months. The clinical utility study shows improved patient compliance to either defer prostate biopsy or proceed with biopsy compared to the control arm when implementing the ExoDx prostate test in clinical practice. Due to this increased compliance to proceed with biopsy, physicians detected 30% more cases of clinically significant or high-grade prostate cancer compared to the standard of care control alarm. Implementing EPI not only saves the health care system money by avoiding unnecessary biopsies but also increases compliance among patients that need biopsies, leading to higher cancer detection rates. We anticipate the clinical utility and economic value shown in this study will resonate with the private payer community, increasing the frequency of our conversations and strengthening the argument for favorable coverage decisions. Currently, the coronavirus pandemic has had an impact on a number of individual-seeking wellness business which in turn has had an impact on the number of PSA tests and ultimately the number of ExoDx prostate tests conducted. We saw this play out during the month of March, and the decline in test has continued into April. We responded by recently launching an at home collection kit for our ExoDx prostate test, enabling men who are sheltering in place and thus unable to see a health care professional to know if a biopsy should be prioritized. The solution was launched with a patient-targeted marketing strategy, including Search Engine Optimization, a Facebook campaign and webinars to drive awareness that patients do not need to go into the urologist\u2019s office to have access to this valuable test. We believe the flexibility of providing a urine sample at the convenience of the patient will be yet another key differentiator of the ExoDx prostate test from the competition. With a pipeline of additional tests, companion diagnostic applications and partnership opportunities, there are multiple avenues to create value with Exosome Diagnostics. We have a few partnerships in place and are in active discussions with several diagnostics and biopharmaceutical companies for potential applications of Exosome Diagnostics technology. In summary, I\u2019m very proud of the way our team executed in our fiscal third quarter, especially considering the global challenges created by COVID-19. The pandemic creates some near-term challenges, but also some near-term opportunities as we deploy reagents to enable vaccine and therapeutic discoveries and diagnostic solutions. Stepping back from the current environment, our pillars for growth are fully in place. We remain in the very early innings of realizing a tremendous liquid biopsy and cell and gene therapy potential opportunities. And our proteomic and genomic and analytical tools remain extremely well positioned in very underpenetrated markets. I firmly believe that the environment for life science research and diagnostics will be even stronger as we emerge from this pandemic, and we have the financial strength and product portfolio to capitalize on these opportunities. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jim. Jim Hippel : Thanks, Chuck. I will provide an overview of our Q3 financial performance for the total company, and provide some additional color on the performance of each of our segments, and give some initial thoughts on potential scenarios for our Q4. Starting with the overall third quarter financial performance. Adjusted EPS was $1.39 versus $1.21 one-year ago, with foreign exchange positively impacting EPS by $0.07. Most of the foreign exchange impact was due to non-operating foreign exchange related to our cash pooling arrangement. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.92 compared with $1.15 in the prior year. The biggest driver for the decrease in GAAP EPS was $400,000 in realized and unrealized gains on our investment in ChemoCentryx compared to the $12.3 million in unrealized gains in the prior year. Q3 revenue was $194.7 million, an increase of 5% year-over-year on a reported basis. Organically, revenue increased 6%, with foreign exchange translation having an unfavorable impact of 1% and less than 1% growth contribution from acquisitions. By geography, the U.S. grew in the low double digits, while Europe declined approximately 7% and China grew mid-single digits. As for the rest of Asia, organic growth was in the mid-teens. By end market, which excludes Asia, our Diagnostics division and other OEM customers, biopharma growth was in the low teens, while academic sales decreased by the low-single digits. Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin was 71.5% in the quarter compared to 71.3% in the prior year. The increase was due to volume leverage, partially offset by foreign currency headwinds and, to a lesser extent, the B-MoGen acquisition. Adjusted SG&A in Q3 was 26.8% of revenue, a 90 basis point improvement compared to the prior year, with volume leverage partially offset by investments in our core business to drive near and long-term growth. R&D expense in Q3 was 8.2% of revenue, 20 basis points lower than the prior year, primarily due to volume leverage. The resulting adjusted operating margin for Q3 was 36.5%, an increase of 130 basis points from the prior year period and 310 basis points higher than our second fiscal quarter result. Looking at our numbers below operating income. Net interest expense in Q3 was $4.2 million, decreasing $0.7 million compared to the prior year period. The decrease was due to a substantial reduction of our bank debt during the first half of fiscal 2020. Our bank debt on the balance sheet as of the end of Q3 stood at $420 million. Other adjusted non-operating income was $3 million for the quarter compared to $1.5 million of other expense from Q3 last year, primarily reflecting the foreign exchange impact related to our cash pooling arrangements. For GAAP reporting, other non-operating income includes realized and unrealized gains from our investment in ChemoCentryx. Moving further down the P&L, our adjusted effective tax rate in Q3 was 21.3%, and we are anticipating Q4\u2019s rate to be closer to our year-to-date adjusted tax rate of 21.6%. Turning to cash flow and return of capital. $49.5 million of cash was generated from operations in the quarter, up 25% over Q3 of last year. We also added to our cash position by monetizing approximately $30 million of our ChemoCentryx investment during the quarter. In Q3, our net investment in capital expenditures was $9.3 million, mostly driven by construction of our new GMP protein factory, which remains on schedule for completion by the end of the calendar year. And during Q3, we returned capital to shareholders with $12.3 million of dividends and approximately $50 million of share buybacks, leaving 39.4 million average diluted shares outstanding at the end of the quarter. Next, I\u2019ll discuss the performance of our reporting segments, starting with the Protein Sciences segment. Q3 reported sales were $145.5 million, with reported revenue increasing 6%. Organic growth was also 6%, with foreign exchange having an unfavorable impact of 1% on revenue growth and acquisitions contributing 1% to revenue growth. Growth in the segment was driven by strong demand for protein reagents and both our Biologics and Simple Plex instrument platforms, partially offset by the impacts of COVID-19 customer shutdowns. Operating margin for the Protein Sciences segment was 44.7%, a decrease of 40 basis points year-over-year due to unfavorable foreign exchange and the B-MoGen acquisition. Turning to the Diagnostics and Genomics segment. Q3 reported sales were $49.4 million, an increase of 5% from the prior year. Organically, revenues also grew 5%, with foreign exchange translation having an immaterial impact on revenue. Our Genomic divisions RNAscope contributed solid double-digit growth in the Americas, but this growth was partially offset by COVID-19 customer shutdowns in China as well as Europe. Exosome Diagnostics contributed approximately 3% to the segment\u2019s growth in Q3, with Medicare collections over $1 million following the final lab coverage decision by NGS in December. Moving on to operating margin for the Diagnostics and Genomics segment, at 14.3%, the segment\u2019s operating margin improved from 7.6% reported in the prior year. The increase reflects a near double in operating profit due to less dilution from Exosome Diagnostics, volume leverage from our Genomics division and productivity gains from our diagnostic tools division. As many of you know, it is not our policy to provide specific annual or quarterly guidance, but instead provide some high level color, and how we anticipate our business to perform relative to our longer-term strategic plan. Clearly, the evolving COVID-19 pandemic and related customer impact was not contemplated in our long-term strategic plan nor a shorter-term annual plan. Therefore, I thought it\u2019d be helpful to provide some color on the impact we\u2019ve seen from COVID-19 so far in April and possible scenarios of how it could play out for our Q4. Let me begin with the headwinds we\u2019ve seen so far in April. With most academic institutions shut down in the Americas and Europe and some nonessential research put on pause by biopharma, our run rate in reagent and assay businesses in these geographies has dropped off considerably from prior year levels in the range of minus 20% to minus 40%, depending on the product line and specific regions. Encouragingly, there have been recent talk in both Europe and the U.S. about slowly and systematically opening up universities for professors to conduct their research, even if uncertain about students returning in the fall. Obviously, when it is safe to do so and this talk becomes action, our run rates will gradually improve as researchers return to their labs. Chuck has already mentioned the headwinds we face in Asia outside of China due to reoccurrences of the virus in places like Japan and Singapore as well as the full walk-down in India. However, China is looking like a nice tailwind for us in Q4 with growth rebounding well into the double digits. Other tailwinds for Q4 include our Biologics and Simple Plex instrument product lines. Just as they led our growth in Q3, these platforms have started out just as strong in April, and we expect a high demand for them to continue, especially the Simple Plex platform, which is specific to COVID-19 treatment-related needs. And finally, we should experience some tailwinds from all the other COVID-19 initiatives that Chuck previously discussed. But as many of these products are still currently under development, knowing exactly how much they will contribute to Q4 revenue is difficult to project. All this being said, our best estimate of how these variables will play out, results in a Q4 organic growth being somewhere in the range between minus 10% and minus 20%. Because we do not anticipate that our higher-margin reagent business so \u2013 because we do anticipate that our higher-margin reagent business will be more severely impacted by the shutdown. This will likely have a material negative impact on gross margins for the quarter. Our operating margin will likely be further pressured by our operating cost base being relatively flat to prior year on much lower revenues. Right now, we are assuming that we have seen the worst impact from COVID-19 in April, and that conditions will gradually improve from here. And when they do, we will emerge as an even stronger company as we continue down our path of executing on our strategic plans and key growth initiatives. In summary, despite unprecedented conditions created by COVID-19, we delivered 6% organic growth in the third quarter. We are in a position of financial strength with cash and short-term investments in excess of $250 million and a leverage ratio of just 1.4 times. One thing this global pandemic has clearly highlighted is the need for life sciences research, and we believe that global demand for our tools, which enable drug discovery and production, genomic and proteomic analysis and diagnostic solutions will emerge from this pandemic stronger than when it began. Our global teams and product portfolio are positioned to capture that stronger demand in addition to our original growth plans when the virus-related headwinds subside. With that, that concludes my prepared comments, and I will turn the call back over to the operator for the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners. Please proceed with your question. Puneet Souda : Hi, great, thanks. So Chuck, first of all, congrats on a solid quarter here despite the disruption and it\u2019s good to see the resiliency in China and very tough compares that you had already from last year. So in April, if you could \u2013 thanks for the comments, but I wanted to understand how do you view the recovery here for academic and biopharma segments, just sort of given the behavior academic has been impacted more heavily? Any sort of early signs in the latter part of April that you\u2019re seeing here that give you a better picture into May in either of the biopharma segments or the academic segments? Then I have a couple of questions. Chuck Kummeth : Sure. Well, biopharma is still pretty resilient. And I think as we talked about, I think we have some upside even there with a lot of instrumentation that is hotter than ever. Biologics is doing really well. We are starting to see that drift into cell and gene therapy qualification. So we expect that platform to continue to do well. Simple Western is a little bit under pressure because unlike biologics, it\u2019s kind of 50-50 with academia; so a little softer. It\u2019s anyone \u2013 yes, when things start opening up. I mean, you\u2019re hearing it already state-by-state, including lawsuits. There\u2019s a lot of fatigue out there. People want to go back to work. And with that, labs will reopen. And I think people are also getting creative with what they can start doing. And then we are seeing more activity online and a lot of webinar activity. And so end of April, maybe not so much material. By May, we\u2019re hoping some. Certainly, in Q1, we expect to see things starting to come back. So we\u2019re hoping this is more of a V versus a long U. And that\u2019s kind of where we\u2019re looking at it. Jim Hippel : Puneet, another way to think about it too is we\u2019re gradually opening up the economy to go back to work. A lot of it is going to require social distancing practices while at work. There\u2019s an argument that can be made that in labs, in general, it\u2019s potentially easier for those practices to be put in place, perhaps in other types of industries. So another reason why we think that once the economy does, it starts to gradually reopen up life science research will be one of the earlier phases of that. Chuck Kummeth : Well, I know in our own labs, which is remarkably a lot like every other lab, that we\u2019re pretty social distant anyway. People aren\u2019t just on top of one another in these labs. So I think there\u2019s a good \u2013 it\u2019s just going to take time for people to acknowledge that and kind of get into it. But the world is going to be different. There will be masks that work for quite some time, I\u2019m sure, and a lot of different things. But a lot of our people wore that stuff and gloves anyway. So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s been too much issue there. Pretty amazing to see China just kind of turned back on. If there any good data point that if you come back and follow good social distancing, everybody wears a mask, it looks like there\u2019s a good promise that we don\u2019t have a reescalation. So anyone guess over what happens with wave one, two, three over the next coming years. I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be some of that, too, but we\u2019re very, very optimistic that when this is all done, the paltry $40 billion NIH budget is going to go up dramatically. So it\u2019s a rounding year compared to what\u2019s been lost and what\u2019s been thrown around here for stimulus. So research is going to go up, and we\u2019re perfectly positioned. And by the way, we\u2019re going to be plugging some of this hole too with COVID-19 projects, which we alluded to. I wish we had more positive press release type news to give you, but we\u2019re working on many projects here than some that could really scale. But it\u2019s too early to tell you. If and when we come out with tests, serological or other, you\u2019ll know that it will have the R&D systems brand-new quality behind them. So it won\u2019t \u2013 it will be something remarkable and with high sensitivity and specificity, and we\u2019re working on technology platforms around what we\u2019re good at, antibodies and proteins that can be differentiated from everybody out there and who is chasing the stuff. So stay tuned more to come. Puneet Souda : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. So following on that, in COVID research, I know it\u2019s tough to quantify this, but do you expect to see any benefit from the $25 billion COVID testing and testing research allocation for the \u2013 as part of the coronavirus relief fund? And what\u2019s your expectation here? Just in terms of the portfolio, the breadth of the portfolio that you have, from antibodies to cytokines. I mean, how should we think about what parts of the portfolio are likely to benefit when that NIH \u2013 potential NIH increase that could happen in 2021? And so what parts of the portfolio should we expect to benefit from that because there is some expectation that could be directed more towards infectious diseases versus other traditional oncology research and other areas? Chuck Kummeth : Well, it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess how much will go one way versus the other in infectious diseases, but in terms of our portfolio, all of it. I can\u2019t imagine that there won\u2019t be an amazing interest continuing in the proteins that were developed. We\u2019re selling a lot of proteins that things are going up a lot in a lot of categories that are used in this research, and also with antibodies. And poly through monos, it\u2019s been pretty exciting. We almost can\u2019t keep up in some areas. So we\u2019re working on scalable solutions that can resupport partners for things like serological. For \u2013 there\u2019s been a lot of relaxation with the FDA to try and have something work out there and there\u2019s been some negativity around that. But I can guarantee you that we\u2019re on top of this and involved in many fronts and our reagencies are going to do really well. The tools are going to do well. You got to measure this stuff. We are the worldwide leader in ELISA Kits. And ELISA Kit is the best way to do a serologic. It\u2019s the cheapest, it\u2019s fast. Everybody has automation. So we\u2019re a world leader in Luminex with many partners. Luminex is another way to attack a lot of stuff in there. Everyone\u2019s got their flavor of these different partnerships and deals. And it\u2019s just become so vast. And like we talked about here, when do you see a new $1 trillion plus market open up overnight? And it\u2019s \u2013 there are a lot of opportunities here, and we get the best of both worlds to chase the new market, but also do something wonderful for society. We\u2019re going to help eradicate this virus. We\u2019re involved on more fronts than we can even tell you. In terms of resources pivoted, virtually over 200 employees have been refocused around these projects in the company. And they may not all work out. We may win in some, lose in others or be a fast follower in others, but a lot of it or more, been around a lot of innovation, a long time. And these things always lead the stuff. And the funding is going to trickle down to touch many parts of our business. There\u2019s no doubt in my mind. It\u2019s hard to quantify right now, but it\u2019s going to be \u2013 you got to look beyond Q4 and even Q1. You got to look into next year and the year after, we\u2019re going to be stronger than ever with the base business, and we\u2019re going to have all this incremental new business on top of it. And then we still have our cell and gene therapy and Exosome Diagnostics platform is just starting to ramp. So for us, it\u2019s a better story than ever. As we start looking out one, two, three years, I mean, in our opinion, in Q3. Our Q3 results just kind of make that indicative. We had a pretty darn good quarter. Puneet Souda : Yes. Last one, if I could ask on China. That was a surprisingly good quarter given sort of compared to what we were heading into. The shape of resiliency that you\u2019re seeing there currently; what\u2019s your expectation? How long do you think \u2013 I mean sort of how long is that sustainable? There are some questions being raised on the recurrence of the virus. Obviously, China was ahead of the curve. So what are you hearing from your team on the ground there? Chuck Kummeth : Well, we have our whole team in, and we have our management in, too, including our leaders had to go in and go through quarantine to get back in the country. The country has got very, very strict guidelines to get in. So they\u2019re not letting anybody in without going through quarantine. So that\u2019s a big part of why they\u2019re staying safer probably. Everybody is wearing masks, according to our team. If you\u2019re \u2013 China is one of those countries where there\u2019s a lot of lines in and so social distance up to this point was a very small distance. It\u2019s going to change and it is changing. And there\u2019s not been a material resurgence. So if there\u2019s no resurgence, we think it\u2019s, like we said, back to double-digit or higher already this quarter. So nothing but up. If there\u2019s a resurgence and there\u2019s new rules going in place, we\u2019ll have to adjust. But right now, there\u2019s nothing to worry about there. I\u2019m frankly, much more concerned about what happens in India. And Japan and Korea are both a little behind the curve right now as well. So although we had a wonderful Q3, it\u2019s because really, they were just late to the game of the lockdowns. So as they work through their lockdowns this quarter, we\u2019ll have that hit, but hopefully, they\u2019ll have the same coming out that China did. But judging what we\u2019re seeing in Brazil right now, I don\u2019t like seeing that because I think India is really at risk. But \u2013 and that\u2019s a big growth platform for not this year per se materially, but looking five years out, so it could put some risk into that. But I think Korea and Japan will be fine after a quarter here. And I think China is moving forward. We don\u2019t see a real hit. Europe is a slower recovery and its country-by-country. We were having an outstanding quarter until this hit. And \u2013 but I do think we are on track with a lot of fixing of Europe already, execution-wise, which is in place. And so as they go back to work and labs reopen, I think we\u2019ll be in a much better spot in Europe as well. U.S. has been phenomenal. So \u2013 and it remains so. And this is where we\u2019re going to see a lot of our COVID-19 incremental growth this quarter and beyond. So hopefully, we\u2019ll have nothing to show but extra positive news there. So this is almost sadly the event we\u2019re looking for, for Ella. Ella is finally going to see its day. And we\u2019re up \u2013 we expect 75% growth in Ella this quarter and probably a double for next year again. So it\u2019s going to become a material platform, finally, when this is all said and done. And our ability to get it through all the FDA-related clearances has become easier, obviously. So... Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Catherine Schulte with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Catherine Schulte : Hey, guys. Thanks for the question and congrats on a nice quarter. I guess, first, just going back to China. We\u2019ve heard from other companies that academic and government labs have lagged in terms of reopening. Sounds like you are not seeing that, but just curious to hear, what was the low watermark for activity in China? Was that at 1 point down 20% to 40% as well? And what did that path to recovery look like? Chuck Kummeth : It never went negative. And we ended mid-single digit. We were expecting \u2013 we do it like everyone, we got a monthly flash. We had a monthly process, and we were expecting maybe minus 2, minus 3. That\u2019s the team was thinking, but it never got down there, and we ended up mid-single digit. I think you\u2019re seeing a difference us versus others and other peers have a lot heavier instrumentation level in their portfolio than we do. We\u2019re also not that big, right? So on the reagents front and the things that can back up to speed quick in lab, that\u2019s kind of us. So it\u2019s a quicker recovery. If you\u2019re dealing in mass spec and HPLC and things like that, it\u2019s going to be slower. So I think you\u2019re seeing some of that. And \u2013 but we were on a nice growth level anyway. So I\u2019m not surprised to see this as long as labs are back at work. The kind of research they do with us with a lot of reagents level testing is something that will snap back quickly, which we also expect to see as well following in Europe and U.S. that\u2019s why we made the comments that we did about a fast recovery once labs reopen. Jim Hippel : Yes, Catherine, this is Jim, and following on what Chuck just said, and Chuck is correct in saying that never throughout the quarter cumulatively that China ever fall below zero percent growth. However, you actually look at how the quarter played out. January was extremely strong. Just as we finished Q4 very strong in China, that momentum continued into January. It was basically a record January in terms of organic growth for China. And then as you would expect, in February, it was practically a complete shutdown. But by the time we got into early in mid-March, it rapidly started picking up again. And that\u2019s kind of \u2013 that was kind of \u2013 when it was on, it was on very, very strong, and when it was off, it was not even a trickle. Chuck Kummeth : And like we said before, I think with virtually a one quarter or less than a quarter shutdown, you don\u2019t see a lot of \u2013 first, I\u2019m a little confused by some of the instrument players out there with their comments because with one quarter shutdown or less, it shouldn\u2019t have that big of an impact on instrumentation and the way the sales cycle is for those. I can tell you, our instrumentation is come out of the door strong in April because there\u2019s been pent-up demand. Because it\u2019s only been off for a month or two. So these orders were there. And now there\u2019s somebody there to take delivery. And we\u2019re \u2013 our bookings are really strong in China right now and all our instrumentations. Catherine Schulte : Okay, very helpful. And then I appreciate the commentary on your core reagent portfolio trends in April. Any comments on what you\u2019re seeing in the OEM Diagnostics business? Is the COVID-related activity enough to drive growth in that Diagnostic sub-segment? Or are there more meaningful... Chuck Kummeth : Well, we had a great quarter there. And in fact, this is \u2013 shouldn\u2019t be unnoticed, the third quarter in a row without being negative. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s ever happened. So as I\u2019ve stated, our lumpiness is starting to dissolve. We\u2019ve got our glucose under control. But there is a lot of our reagents that go into the pipeline for diagnostics, and a lot of it\u2019s headed towards COVID-19 as well. So we\u2019re very strong right now. Hematology is strong. And the Diagnostics, in general, the upstream work that we do at San Marcos is very strong. A lot of large orders. As you know, we ship a lot of IgM and IgG. So they\u2019re \u2013 there are a lot of players that want everything we can make. Our issue is now we\u2019re starting to look at our own level of possible serologic than anything else. So we need a lot of the stuff ourselves. And so we\u2019ve never had \u2013 we\u2019ve never had this before, but we can\u2019t \u2013 we don\u2019t \u2013 we can\u2019t make enough. So we\u2019re really focused on that. So yes, I think it\u2019s \u2013 the strength in our \u2013 we call our Diagnostics Tools division is \u2013 will remain strong. So I mean, it\u2019s still not the \u2013 margins were very good this quarter. Its one area we do get leverage with scale with that, and we see it continuing. So best it\u2019s been. And the pipeline has never been better. I\u2019ve told you for many quarters it\u2019s been building and we have newer companies coming on board, and we\u2019re getting more visibility. Companies like Mindray in China, very strong customers and getting stronger and stronger. So the business is building. So it\u2019s great. Catherine Schulte : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Dan Arias with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Dan Arias : Good morning, guys. Thanks. Chuck, I just wanted to ask about antibodies. How big is the portfolio in revenue terms these days? And to some of the points that you made, can you just sort of talk through how we should think about the totality of drug discovery efforts and the serology testing activities when it comes to the growth that you\u2019re expecting there \u2013 that you saw and that you\u2019re expecting there versus maybe the pre-pandemic average? Chuck Kummeth : Yes. Well, as you know, we make and sell over 50,000 reagents, and over half of those are antibodies. And then we redistribute and source another couple of hundred thousand or more. There\u2019s a long tail, though, as you can imagine, and we have a lot of heavy runners. And like I just mentioned, we saw a lot of bulk orders in IgM to some of the big eyes out there in Diagnostics, always have. This gives us the ability to do things for ourselves, should we want to. And so we have been under attack by many partners who want to work with us to have our world-class quality reagents into their tests. Here\u2019s the issue. Anybody in their kitchen can make 20 assays and get through a decent qualification and make it look like they have something. It\u2019s a much bigger deal when you\u2019ve got to figure out a way to make 5 million tests a week. We can do that. So we\u2019re working on scaling that. We don\u2019t give out still the numbers of our actual component of a division like that, but it\u2019s still roughly in just around one-third or so of that division. And you\u2019ve \u2013 we\u2019ve been talking about the growth rates. Our growth rates in antibodies have been very strong, double-digit up until recently, and we\u2019ve been taking share really everywhere across the world. We\u2019ve been attributing that to our strong digital campaign and our digital processes and websites coming together and being able to do a lot more SEO and et cetera, and AdWords payment and such; so all these have worked a lot for us. But that\u2019s kind of across the portfolio. So right now, the focus is on how to how to scale a handful of these that are in super high demand because these are the winners of the world looking for these very scalable tests. The trick is can you scale them? Can you make them in a bulk form, in a cell line, and which means you\u2019ve got to be looking at monos probably. And we\u2019re one of the few companies in the world that can really do this. And that when we say we can do it, we can do it. So stay tuned. Dan Arias : Okay. So if we assume that you are one of few that can manufacture and scale the way that you\u2019re talking about, would the benefit to be derived in 2Q be greater than it was in 1Q? And should we think about that growth rate being above the \u2013 I think you said low-double digits or maybe just double digits that you\u2019ve seen in previous quarters? I guess I\u2019m trying to understand what has taken place for some of these companies versus what might come in 2Q? Chuck Kummeth : It\u2019s going to be a mix. Well, still the vast amount of our portfolio that\u2019s for research, right? And with academic labs down starting \u2013 so we had that hit. It wasn\u2019t so bad in Q3, but Q4, we\u2019ve talked about where it\u2019s going to be. So will the new antibody work for all these tests offset the gap from academic research in general? It\u2019s hard to guess. Some of these are massive opportunities. It\u2019s going to depend if we get the deal or not. And if we get it, we\u2019ll be talking about it. If we don\u2019t, we\u2019ll be \u2013 we probably won\u2019t be able to make that gap up in a quarter. But if you look out a year, I think we\u2019ll have \u2013 we\u2019ll be back in full strength and double-digit on antibody. And I think we\u2019ll have some portion of all this new world going ahead as well. So I expect our antibody business to be thriving in a year from now. It\u2019s really hard to pin down how much, but got to be a couple of points better than we were doing up until this quarter, I would think, at least. And it could be multiples of that if we get some of these opportunities land in our favor. Dan Arias : Got it. Okay. Maybe just on Exosome. Jim, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re prioritizing the sales and marketing activities right now. So what are you thinking about when it comes to investment in sales force expansion and promotion? Are you able to stay the course on what you\u2019ve been trying to do there? And then maybe somewhat along those lines, appreciate the heads-up on the publication on ExoDx that\u2019s on its way. Is there anything in terms of a head-to-head study versus other tests that might be in the works? Thanks. Jim Hippel : Yes. With regards to the investments on the commercial side, I mean, clearly, as \u2013 right now, we\u2019re definitely focusing on the digital marketing aspects of it, as Chuck talked about in his script. I mean, reality is mostly urologists are at home right now. And so \u2013 and we\u2019re actually encouraging because we\u2019re getting actually some very good response rates from them on webinars and hits to our websites and questions and so forth. So it would be nice if we could actually turn this a bit to our advantage and be able to have more contact with them and more education of our product with them during this time when they\u2019re not, frankly, going into their doctor\u2019s office. And so then \u2013 until then we\u2019ll see as they start to come back in the office as the restrictions start to get lifted, and we\u2019ll \u2013 that\u2019s what we need from a sales force going forward from there. But there\u2019s no immediate plan. Chuck Kummeth : Talk about the quarter-to-quarter sequential improvement in the dilution because we are making money. We\u2019re kind of watching our investment that\u2019s working. Jim Hippel : Yes. Yes. I mean, obviously, this is the most meaningful revenue we\u2019ve had with Exosome this quarter so far to date. And our dilution with regards to the Exosome business is a lot less this quarter than it has been. That all being said, if you exclude Exosome from our results, we still would be over 40% operating margin in the rest of the company. So... Chuck Kummeth : And I\u2019ll add to that and then cover the utility study. We could invest harder, but now more than ever, there\u2019s no need. I mentioned about a very successful webinar of 100. We\u2019ve actually had \u2013 since the last few days, multiple webinars with over 100 urologists. So they\u2019re all tuning in. And this home study is really going to be helpful. I mean, and the Exact Sciences is a good example of what you can do with a home application. But we started this out with a very small set of KOLs to get a launch, get it going and kind of work the kinks out. It\u2019s had already remarkable success. We\u2019re expanding it immediately. So I think this is great. And all our competition out there, you either have to do a blood sample or a DRE, so you can\u2019t do those at home. So we have clearly now a real differentiatable solution. So that\u2019s all going pretty well. And we\u2019re still focused on partnerships and talking to multiple entities. One deal we do have done we will be announcing soon and hopefully some more coming as well. And then there\u2019s a long term platform. We are in the midst of the clinical study for the bladder. Things have slowed down with patients, obviously, with electable things not being pushed out. And kidney rejection is moving forward as well, but we\u2019re still negotiating, looking at partnerships on the blood side. We have validated tests for lung and breast and a lot of interest, but these things take time. So it\u2019s a platform that\u2019s going to get there, whether it\u2019s really there and as a home run in one, two, three years or it takes 10, I don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s all going in the right direction. The utility study has been done for a while, and it\u2019s nothing more we can do. It\u2019s in their hands and they\u2019re making the pretty pictures and getting it ready for print. And it\u2019s supposed to be within the month, but we said two months are better in the transcript today, but we expect it to come out in May. Its 1,000 patients, so it\u2019s a good study and it has an amazing control element to it as well. So it\u2019s going to get a lot of notice. So it\u2019s going to have an impact. And we, of course, have pre-released it to the \u2013 a lot of the payers. And they\u2019re impressed, but of course, they want to see it in formal print before they can make any coverage decision. So it\u2019s all going in the right direction, expect that to happen this quarter as well. And onward and forward, we\u2019ll keep grinding. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Dan Leonard : Thank you. So first question, appreciate the color on April trends for the reagent business. Is it possible you can quantify April result revenue trends for the total company? Just so we could assess like how much of an improvement do we need to assume May and June to get to that, call it, negative 10% to negative 20% number for the June quarter? Chuck Kummeth : Well, we\u2019re hoping it\u2019s the bottom of the quarter. So you can take that as you may and get to your minus 10%, 20% we gave. It\u2019s hard to give you much more than that, Dan, right now. Jim Hippel : The other reason for that Dan is because one of those tailwinds I mentioned is what we\u2019re seeing in our instruments portfolio, specifically in Biologics and Simple Plex. It\u2019s based off of order rates that we\u2019re seeing so far in April. But we\u2019re very cautious about getting overly optimistic about that because the reality is the order flow of instruments is much more heavier in the back half of the quarter than it is in the first half. So even though the year-over-year improvement is very, very strong, it\u2019s off a very low number to begin with. And so that\u2019s why we hesitate to give those numbers out specifically. Chuck Kummeth : I can tell you though. We expected 75% growth in the Ella platform is only that because we can\u2019t make any more. We\u2019re going to have over 150% growth in instruments this quarter alone in that platform. It\u2019s a complicated cartridge, as you know, and it\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s \u2013 we just can\u2019t make anymore. We can\u2019t scale it more quickly than that, but it\u2019s going to keep growing at those kind of levels, I think, quarter-on-quarter now, hopefully, so. One good success story, I mean a year from now; it will be a very material part of that division. Dan Leonard : Appreciate that. And then just a follow-up. Chuck, could you elaborate a bit on your comments regarding the first supply agreement in cell and gene therapy. Was that something that that you had in the funnel prior to committing to the new facility and partnership? Or is that something materialized post you putting a shovel on the ground? Any further color would be appreciated. Thank you. Chuck Kummeth : Yes. Well, there have been dozens of pre-clinicals and valuations. We\u2019re selling a lot of GMP proteins now. Unfortunately, they\u2019re very small lots because they\u2019re basically in our research facility. That\u2019s why we\u2019re building a GMP factory. So we\u2019re testing and looking at equal \u2013 equality programs or things in clinicals right now on many, many fronts. This one is one that\u2019s been in the mix for a while, and it was the first one to come up, but there\u2019s many more close behind it. Now that said, just because they get a supply agreement in place, doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re ready to go to the races here with volume. It\u2019s going to take time to finish their Phase IIIs and get ramped and there\u2019s timing. So it\u2019s a one \u2013 that\u2019s one quarter to four or five quarters until you can start seeing anything come out of at the other end. But like I said, I think there\u2019s such a stigma around the whole viral vector side of all this stuff, and people are \u2013 they\u2019re scared about these 18-month lead times you\u2019re seeing on these approaches and cell therapies that we expect there\u2019s going to be a continuation of people coming to us early like this company did before they\u2019re done with their clinicals to try and get a supply agreement in place, do the test and make sure they like what they see and try to make sure they know they\u2019re going to get something without waiting a year or two to get access to supply. So it\u2019s still kind of a J-curve. We don\u2019t expect our cell and gene therapy business to be at that $300 million level as a potential division for five years out. And it\u2019s a J-curve to get there, but the best part of that \u2013 the front end of that, the biggest part of the growth of assets will be GMP protein as we feel so. I can tell you the JV the stuff does funnel through that, and they have over 100 customers that are evaluating. Everything from the de novo instrument through PC [ph] buster, through our cloud, so there\u2019s a lot of activity. This thing is going to happen. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jacob Johnson with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Jacob Johnson : Hey, thanks. A really strong margins in the Diagnostics and Genomics segment. Jim, I think you alluded this, it sounds like it was a little bit less dilution from Exosome. But could you give us some more color on margins in that segment? And is this the 14% margin level this quarter? Mean, should we think of this as kind of a new floor for the segment going forward? Or were there some benefits that helped you in the quarter? Jim Hippel : No, there really wasn\u2019t any real one-time benefits. If there was any that it can be variable, it would be in our diagnostic tools. They had large order flows from customers, and some of those orders are more profitable than others. So they did have some favorable mix in addition to their productivity measures they put in place. But I do believe mid-teens going forward is something we should be expecting from this segment. All three parts of that segment, Exosomes, Genomics division as well as our Diagnostic Tools had expanding margins year-over-year. Chuck Kummeth : As you know, we\u2019ve been waiting many, many years to get back into Sysmex, and that\u2019s when working out now. So before I arrived, I think it\u2019s eight, nine years ago, they lost a big lawsuit here with them, and there was IP involved. And that IP has expired all this past year, and so we\u2019re after it and they\u2019re after it with us. And we\u2019re growing that account, which is one of the biggest accounts in the world in this area for controls, and then the pipeline is full of others as well. So this division is never \u2013 in my mind, never looked better in terms of a potential evening out and leveling the growth. Jim Hippel : And Jake, this is Jim again. Let me just clarify my statement. I\u2019d say on a normalized basis going forward, that should be the floor we should expect going forward in Q4, unfortunately, I do believe will be an exception to that just because of the volume drop off is going to be significant in both segments, we believe, at this point in time. Chuck Kummeth : I think the big takeaway is that we\u2019re hoping for more of a V versus a long-standing U here, okay, in recovery. So we\u2019ve got to all watch the level of resurgence. And if these lockdowns come up, if fatigue does really take over and states open up and labs reopen under \u2013 maybe under new ways to work and stuff, we\u2019re going to get a lot more business quickly. And we\u2019ll just have to watch and see what happens with the virus after that. So hopefully, these antivirals come on strong as they look like they are reaching the news now and a year from now when people know there is a vaccine, it possibly can help. I think it will take an extra year for people to trust the vaccine, but it\u2019s a year out to be back to normal in business, but I think we\u2019ve got new stuff coming that layers on top. But I think also the added investment into research already being talked about is going to \u2013 we\u2019re going to get a bunch of it. We\u2019re going to have to. I mean, there\u2019s no way for us not to. We\u2019re just too much everywhere. Jacob Johnson : That\u2019s very helpful. And Chuck, you touched on digital marketing efforts a couple of times. It sounds like they\u2019ve helped in this COVID environment. How is the effort progressing to implement that in Europe? Chuck Kummeth : Well, you saw our great results on OpEx this quarter. There\u2019s only one area we\u2019re overspent, and that\u2019s that area. So we keep doing a lot of data analytics and seeing what we\u2019re getting for our digital investments. And we continue to get more than 10 :1, $10 to $1 on investment and basically in revenue. So every dollar we invest in the digital platform, we\u2019re getting back 10 or better in revenue. So I\u2019ve told the team, keep doing it, keep spending, keep buying AdWords, keep working on SEO, keep getting into our customers\u2019 laptops and computer environments as they\u2019re searching, and it\u2019s going to lead to more business, and it\u2019s so far working. It\u2019s just as important in Europe as it is the U.S. I think Asia is a little different. Much more local language involved there. But we\u2019re also expanding now in Europe to make sure we have a German version of everything we\u2019re doing as well as others, and that\u2019s also going to help. And that\u2019s early days for that, but that\u2019s more upside, I think. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Patrick Donnelly : Great. Thanks for taking the question, guys. Maybe just on the current quarter, did you see any pull forward activity on the consumable side, just with labs preparing for potential supply chain disruption as the results came in pretty solidly? Just trying to figure out if there\u2019s anything onetime portfolio stocking put? Chuck Kummeth : Yes. There may have been a little bit in January in China, getting ahead of things, but it was probably more for the New Year than it was, it seemed they have a pandemic coming. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen or talked about any of that. Not noticed any. No. I think if we are looking at a V here, not a U, I do think that we\u2019ll have a quick snapback, and those orders, for instance, won\u2019t go away. But if labs are shut down all year, then I think there is a bigger impact on larger orders and capital investments like that. But right now, we don\u2019t see it, to be honest. Patrick Donnelly : Okay. And then the kind of the V you\u2019re talking about, are you broadly expecting that across the end markets? Or are you kind of feeling like each end market could be a little different in terms of labs coming back online, the ability to order right away, et cetera? Chuck Kummeth : Yes. Biopharma is steeper V, clearly. But we have less lab shutdown. They\u2019re all working at least partially, right? They\u2019re all \u2013 everyone else are staged and shifting. So there\u2019s a little less activity, but they\u2019re all open. Academia is going to be about once they come on so it\u2019s going to be slower. And it\u2019s going to be university-to-university, state-by-state. We\u2019ve got very extensive plans out with all our sites of how we reopen, how we work locally with \u2013 within their states and their state guidelines, which are going to be all over the map, as you realize, so. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Knight with Janney Montgomery Scott. Please proceed with your question. Paul Knight : Hey, Chuck, are you seeing the start of any stimulus like the NIH is getting $1.5 billion? Are you seeing that in the discussions with those clients or customers academically? Or \u2013 and when would you expect it to hit if you do see those monies starting to develop? Chuck Kummeth : I think it\u2019s early. Like everybody else, we buy the research to know where the grand money is going. And so we\u2019ll be chasing that like everybody else. But as you know, we sell everywhere. So we\u2019re going to get our piece of it. And we talked the last two, three, four years, it\u2019s been roughly a 6% to 7%, 8% kind of increase annually in NIH, it\u2019s been good times for the last few years, right? And we\u2019ve talked about that adding a point to our organic growth because of that. So you can do the math yourself, but if we have this kind of influx, I think you can go on those kinds of ratios, I think. And yes, we\u2019re going to be involved. And yes, we\u2019re going to get a piece of it. And \u2013 but I do think it\u2019s still early. Paul Knight : Chuck, do you think that with your ProteinSimple platform that \u2013 where are we with the customer penetration? And do you think in, I guess, this shutdown period that people will come back and maybe ramp up their transition to ProteinSimple faster? I mean, is there a possibility of that, but the first question really is your penetration now versus traditional Western blot. So \u2013 and can you think you can pick it up when they have time to plan the operations a little time while in this quiet period? Chuck Kummeth : Yes. The only reason that platform was down was because they\u2019re truly half in academia. So we\u2019re still under 15% penetrated, we think. So when things are all back online, I think we\u2019re back to double-digit growth of that. And it\u2019s been consistent. I think it\u2019ll remain consistent. Biologics has been a really nice come around here, and we talked about a couple of quarters ago, that being more and more interest in using the platform, in cell and gene therapy and QC-related activity, and that\u2019s happening. And it\u2019s happening everywhere, including Europe. So that\u2019s really good to see. And that we have a higher penetration obviously, and we\u2019re not the only game in town going after biologics, right? So \u2013 and then Simple Plex is \u2013 there\u2019s lots of different flavors of doing multiplexing type of assays. Ours, of course, is highly sensitive, very fast because it\u2019s microfluidic. It\u2019s one of the few platforms that can do a panel in an hour and give you really good results for a problem like a cytokine storm problem. You aren\u2019t going to wheel lock a Quanterix into a hospital as easily. So we\u2019re winning all that business because of the ease of use, the fast speed of the results. It\u2019s the size of a bread box, very reasonable in price and a pretty big menu for panels and the ability for us to make custom panels for anybody very quickly. So it\u2019s all about making those cartridges and be able to scale up those panels and that business has been a rocket ride last couple of years. And now from this quarter on, we can\u2019t make enough. So we\u2019ll see. A big drawback has always been that it\u2019s still a research-type instrument. And we\u2019ve never really geared it for diagnostics and for being at the patient and be clinical, but now that\u2019s changing and people are doing that for us because it works so well and they just \u2013 they want it. So they\u2019re doing it. Italy is a good example. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Alex Nowak with Craig-Hallum. Please proceed with your question. Alex Nowak : Very good morning everyone. Chuck, pre-COVID you had some challenges in Europe. Just ignoring COVID for right now, where are you at with reworking that business? And would you expect in two to three quarters coming out of COVID, that geography would be back to double-digit growth? Chuck Kummeth : Great question. Pre-COVID, we were ready to talk about the nice recovery in Europe, which was on track, especially in biologics and this hit and Europe is just shut down. Heck, they\u2019re even on vacation today, after all this. So it is what it is. We have made changes. I think I made those comments in the last quarter. So we\u2019re early on the changes commercial we made \u2013 and I\u2019m hopeful. We\u2019re just not that big yet in Europe. There\u2019s things we can do, and recovery is going to happen there, on that front \u2013 on the execution front. And then again, a lot of the opportunities, Italy is a good example. We\u2019ve got a lot of growth, a lot of work going in Italy, especially when they exhausted their health care system, and they needed testing. So the LS platform is perfect for that because it can measure analytes that spike early in the cycle. So there\u2019s a lot of opportunity there, and we\u2019ll get more. And it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019ll see probably next quarter and quarter after if our decisions bear fruit or not, but they were starting to, through February, so. Alex Nowak : Okay. Understood. And then private companies are having some hard time finding access to capital during this time. That might mean some better valuations on the private side. So should we expect Bio-Techne to be a bit more aggressive with M&A over the next several months to several quarters? Chuck Kummeth : We\u2019re always looking for a deal, Alex. So we\u2019re always hunting. We\u2019re working on some right now. They\u2019re smaller, but they\u2019re good ones. We\u2019ll see. I expect some things to get cheaper after all this is kind of done, and there\u2019s some denial that leaves the system, but we\u2019ll see. Operator : We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments. Chuck Kummeth : Well, thanks. Thanks, everybody, for coming online. Again, I want to thank all our employees and partners that was \u2013 we\u2019ve never worked harder, I can tell you that, and we\u2019ve got a great team in place that all come with great resumes. They know how to work through a crisis like this. We\u2019re doing all the right things. We\u2019re working very ethically as well. We\u2019re trying to solve these problems and help as much as we are trying to make new business. So look forward to a better quarter and a quarter out. This quarter, we\u2019ll see how it turns out. It\u2019s a wide range, but everyone is given a wide range. And I think you know the drill there. So everyone stay safe, and we\u2019ll do the best we can, and we\u2019ll talk to you next quarter. Bye. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.",

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. And the call will be open for questions following management\u2019s prepared remarks. During our Q&A session, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. I would now like to turn the call over to David Blair \u2013 David Clair, Bio-Techne\u2019s Senior Director, Investor Relations and Corporate Development. David Clair : Good morning and thank you for joining us. On the call with me this morning are Chuck Kummeth, Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Hippel, Chief Financial Officer of Bio-Techne. Before we begin, let me briefly cover our safe harbor statement. Some of the comments made during this conference call may be considered forward-looking statements, including beliefs and expectations about the company\u2019s future results as well as the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and financial results. The company\u2019s 10-K for fiscal year 2019 identifies certain factors that could cause the company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements made during this call. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of any new information or future events or developments. The 10-K as well as the company\u2019s other SEC filings are available on the company\u2019s website within its Investor Relations section. During the call, non-GAAP financial measures may be used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. Tables reconciling these measures to most comparable GAAP measures are available in the company\u2019s press release issued earlier this morning on the Bio-Techne Corporation website at www.bio-techne.com. I will now turn the call over to Chuck. Chuck Kummeth : Thanks, Dave and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter conference call. With the COVID-19 pandemic in full swing, we just finished the most challenging quarter in my tenure at Bio-Techne, and perhaps the most challenging in the history of the company. Despite the challenges that COVID-19 has brought to all our stakeholders, namely our customers and employees, we persevered through the last quarter of our fiscal 2020 year by outperforming the expectations we set one quarter ago and maintaining a high level of profitability and positive cash flow, all while pivoting a large number of our technical resources toward developing products that will help our customers and society at large eventually defeat this virus. I\u2019ll cover the highlights of these initiatives in a moment, but first, a high level review of our overall results for the quarter and the fiscal year. In Q4, our organic revenue decreased by 8%, outperforming our initial expectations for a decline of somewhere between 10% and 20%. We estimate COVID-related products provided a 5% tailwind during the quarter. This tailwind came from products produced by every division in the company, which play a key role in enabling researchers to better understand COVID-19, develop therapies and vaccines to combat the virus as well as screen and diagnose infected patients. Overall, business trends improved as Q4 progressed with sales declines in the low to mid-teens for the month of April and May, and then improving quite significantly in June to low single-digit declines. However, the swings by end-markets and regions were more pronounced. For example, academic end markets experienced a much more severe trough early in the quarter and have been slower to come back to normal. Well, from a regional perspective, the year bounced back towards the end of the quarter ahead of the U.S. This makes sense given Europe experienced the worst of the economic shut down before the U.S. and so far it seems to have more effectively contained the virus spread. As we all know the spread of the virus and the containment techniques that go along with it, is a very fluid situation. So we are not out of the woods yet, but I am encouraged by the improving business trends we experienced exiting the quarter into July. Given these challenging and uncertain business conditions, we kept our expenses in check, balancing our spending on growth initiatives and our commitment to keeping the Bio-Techne team intact with strict attention to discretionary spending. This financial discipline enabled us to finish the quarter with an adjusted operating margin of 31.1%, clearly not what we expect long-term, but respectable given the current environment. We view the virus impact on our business as transitory and remain confident in our ability to return to at least 40% adjusted operating margins as COVID-related headwinds subside and we execute in our long-term strategic plan. Prior to the pandemic, we were on track to deliver another year of double-digit organic growth in fiscal 2020. But with COVID, we finished the year with 4% organic growth. However, when our customers all eventually return to their labs and clinics, our growth pillars, namely, Cell and Gene Therapy, Exosome Diagnostics, Genomics RNAscope and our portfolio of ProteinSimple branded instruments position Bio-Techne to return quickly to a double-digit organic growth profile. And now layering in the potential long-term tailwinds from our new COVID portfolio gives us incremental confidence in our ability to return to our targeted growth trajectory. Before I update you on our key strategic growth and COVID-related activities, I do want to highlight our performance in China. As you know, COVID impacted China most severely back in February and March, when government mandated lockdowns were in force. You will remember from our last earnings call that our China business still managed to grow in the mid single-digits during that very difficult environment. While I couldn\u2019t be happier to report that in Q4 organic growth in China was back over 20%. Our China team has done a phenomenal job adopting to the new normal, leveraging webinars and online meeting tools to stay in front of their customers and drive the business forward as the country emerges from the pandemic. As we start fiscal 2021, we could see growth slow a bit from its Q4 pace as resurgence of the virus has flared up in places like Beijing and Hong Kong. But over the long-term, our China business remains in the early innings of its growth trajectory and there is runway for many more years of 20% annual growth ahead. Now an update on our growth in COVID-19 initiatives, starting with the Protein Sciences segment and our core reagents. Our team quickly recognized the need to help our customers conduct a research in all aspects of COVID-19 and responded by ramping production of related proteins, antibodies, small molecules and assays already found in our catalog. They also developed dozens of new products to support research of this novel virus and are continuing to do so. Within our instruments portfolio, production of our Simple Plex platform was also ramped to meet the soaring demand for Ella instruments and it\u2019s highly sensitive automated immunoassays that are being used to manage patient care associated with the cytokine storm syndrome often found in severely infected patients. With year-on-year growth approaching 100% for this platform in Q4, our operating teams did an outstanding job keeping up with the demand. Also our biologics platform continued to grow exceedingly well with solid double-digit growth both in Q4 and the full year. We have high growth expectations for this platform as it continues to expand its application base from traditional biological drug production quality and control into Cell and Gene Therapy applications. Our Biologics portfolio with its subvisible particle characterization analytical capabilities is also seeing strong interest from vaccine developers enabling them to better understand their manufacturing and product stability processes. Speaking of Cell and Gene Therapy, we continued to make progress on the construction of our newly dedicated GMP protein factory. Construction of the facility remains on track to provide GMP proteins in large scale to our Cell and Gene Therapy customers by the second half of fiscal 2021. In the meantime, our GMP protein portfolio continues to expand at a rapid tight pace, nearly 100% in Q4, which now includes a number of immune cytokines typically used to grow cells for clinical trials. During the quarter, we also launched GMP ProDots. This disruptive product allows still addition of our renowned R&D Systems GMP proteins to culture vessels in Cell and Gene Therapies. As a reminder, earlier this year, we entered into a commercial consortium with Wilson Wolf and Fresenius Kabi that offers easier access to a complete and simplified Cell and Gene Therapy workflow solution using products from all three parties. This workflow includes Fresenius Kabi\u2019s logo instrument for leukophoresis, Wilson Wolf GRx bioreactors and Bio-Techne\u2019s cloud cell activation, TcBuster gene-editing and GMP proteins. During Q4, the JV made additional progress establishing a unified sales structure, a customer-facing website and point-of-sale and creating more impactful marketing collateral, featuring all three parents offerings. We believe the JV is well positioned to take share in this emerging therapeutic market. Moving on to our Diagnostics and Genomics segment, where I\u2019m happy to report that we managed not to decline in revenue this past quarter, despite the COVID shutdown headwinds. I\u2019m even more pleased to report that this segment actually expanded operating margins over last year by more than 200 basis points and increased operating profit by 20%. While our Genomics product for severely impacted by the closure of academic labs, our team was able to partially mitigate this shortfall by producing and selling hundreds of RNAscope probes for COVID-19 virus detection and tissue, allowing researchers to confirm the organs that are susceptible to this virus. Our Diagnostics Research division was able to deliver solid mid single-digit growth in the quarter despite customer delays in ordering controls and calibrators used for routine diagnostic test used by clinicians. Our team was able to more than offset this shortfall by supplying specialty diagnostic antibodies and other raw material to COVID-19 testing manufacturers. And in Exosome Diagnostics, we validated and launched COVID-19 real-time qPCR test in our labs, both in Waltham, Massachusetts and Munich, Germany. Following the implementation of processes and instruments to automate the test, we will be able \u2013 we will be capable of scaling testing capacity several hundred samples per day. This lab developed test will provide rapid and reliable detection of patients with active COVID-19 infections especially in the Boston area. However, Exosome Diagnostics also experienced headwinds related to COVID-19 as ExoDx prostate test volume was severely impacted by the near complete shutdown of urologist offices. As we announced last quarter, the team responded by launching an at-home collection kit in Q4 for ExoDx prostate test, enabling men unable to visit their urologist office to have access to the test and the knowledge of whether a biopsy should be prioritized. The at-home collection kit was launched with the patient targeted marketing strategy including search engine optimization, a Facebook campaign and webinars to drive awareness that patients do not need to go into urologist office to have access to this valuable test. We believe the flexibility of providing a urine sample at the convenience of the patient will be yet another key differentiator of the ExoDx prostate test from the competition. The response to our at-home collection kit has been very positive with both patients and urologists and already consists of more than 10% of our current test volumes. The impact of the at-home test collection kit, our push-pull cart marking strategy and the gradual reopening of urologist offices has had a net positive impact in our EPI test volume since it bottomed in April, with June daily test counts approximately 75% but pre-COVID test monthly run rate and continued to show improvement in July. Before I turn the call over to Jim for a financial review, I want to provide an update on what could be our biggest COVID-19-related initiative to date, our co-branded R&D system, Mount Sinai COVID serology assay test. During the quarter, we announced a collaboration with Kantaro Biosciences, a Mount Sinai led joint venture to manufacture and commercialize the serology assay based on Mount Sinai\u2019s test. This was a tremendous effort by both the Bio-Techne and Mount Sinai teams, convincing the typical 18-month ELISA kit development timeframe to just six weeks. This two-step serology test is a truly differentiated offering going beyond the qualitative information provided by other COVID serology assays in the market, with the second step providing a tighter or measurement of the antibodies present to neutralize the virus. The second step completely eliminates false positives with Mount Sinai\u2019s assay having a 100% Positive Predictive Value or PPV and 99.6% Negative Predictive Value or NPV. To date, diagnostic activity is focused on PCR or antigen-based test to detect active COVID-19 infections. We believe serology test volumes will increase as a second wave of testing emerges focusing on the surveillance activities necessary to reopen an economy and to help better manage vaccination program for once available. Yesterday, Kantaro Biosciences submitted a request to the FDA for an Emergency Use Authorization or EUA for quantitative use of our serological assay. We anticipate the EUA process to be complete in mid- to late-August. Kantaro and Bio-Techne have joined forces to develop marketing materials, a branding and go-to-market strategy for the assay, highlighting the unique quantitative information provided as well as the best-in-class performance of the assay. We are ready to launch this assay upon receipt of the EUA, and have the capacity to produce millions of tests per month as needed. Also yesterday, we announced the launch of a COVID-SeroIndex, a Research Use Only or RUO version of the two-step serology assay. This assay is designed to meet the current vaccine developer needs for object \u2013 for an objective measurement of immune response to a vaccine, making the test ideal for identifying the most potent vaccine candidates, determining optimal dosing, identifying the appropriate vaccine schedule and when boosters may be needed. In summary, I\u2019m extremely proud of the way the team responded to a challenging business environment in the fourth quarter. Our end market showed steady improvement as the quarter progressed and has continued to improve in July with our academic and biopharma end market reopening and our COVID-related products seeing continued traction. We are in the cusp of launching the first commercial quantitative IgG COVID-19 serology assay, which has potential to answer many of the important questions necessary to reopen our economies further and push the best vaccines forward. We are entering fiscal 2021 in a positive \u2013 sorry, in a position of financial strength, with a portfolio of best-in-class products targeting high growth and under penetrated market opportunities. We are ready to continue to execute in our long-term strategic plan. With that, I will turn the call over to Jim. Jim Hippel : Thanks, Chuck. I\u2019ll provide an overview of our Q4 fiscal 2020 financial performance for the total company, provide some additional color on the performance of each of our segments and give some initial thoughts on the pace of business recovery from the pandemic in the near-term. Starting with the overall fourth quarter financial performance; adjusted EPS was $1 versus $1.25 one year ago, with foreign exchange notably impacting EPS by $0.01. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $1.48 compared to $0.42 in the prior year. The biggest driver for the increase in GAAP EPS was unrealized gains on our investment in ChemoCentryx this year compared to unrealized ChemoCentryx losses in the prior year. Q4 revenue was $175.8 million, a decrease of 8% year-over-year on a reported and organic basis. Foreign exchange translation and acquisitions had an immaterial impact on our revenue. For the full year fiscal 2020 revenue was $738.7 million, an increase of 4% on a reported and organic basis. By geography in Q4, the U.S. declined approximately 20%, while Europe declined approximately 4%, as European customer shutdown their labs earlier in the U.S. and then reopened them faster later in the quarter. As Chuck mentioned, China had a remarkable quarter with organic growth increasing 24%. As for the rest of Asia, organic growth declined mid-single digits with almost all countries in some way being negatively impacted by the pandemic. By end market, biopharma declined mid-single digits, while academic sales decreased by nearly 30%. Moving on to the details of the P&L total company adjusted gross margin was 69.5% in the quarter compared with 71.9% in the prior year. The decrease was due to unfavorable volume leverage and mix. Adjusted SG&A in Q4 was 28.9% of revenue, a 60 basis point increase compared to the prior year due to unfavorable volume leverage. I do want to point out that our adjusted SG&A spend was down nearly $3.5 million from the prior year, highlighting our disciplined on discretionary spend while keeping our teams intact with no furloughs or reductions in force. For GAAP reporting, SG&A expense in the current period also reflects an approximately $7 million gain on settlement of the escrow balance associated with the Exosome acquisition. This is accounted for as a reduction in SG&A in Q4 of fiscal year 2020. R&D expense in Q4 was 9.5% of revenue, 100 basis points higher than the prior year, due to unfavorable volume leverage and investments in COVID-19-related product development. Here our adjusted spend was about $0.5 million higher than the prior year, emphasizing our conviction to continue to invest in the business for the long-term. The resulting adjusted operating margin for Q4 was 31.1%, a decrease of 400 basis points from the prior year period. Looking at our numbers below operating income, net interest expense in Q4 was $4.4 million, decreasing $0.8 million compared to the prior year period. The decrease was due to a substantial reduction of our bank debt during fiscal 2020. Our bank debt on the balance sheet as of the end of Q4 stood at $357 million. Other adjusted non-operating income was $0.5 million for the quarter compared to $0.1 million from Q4 last year, primarily reflecting the foreign exchange impact related to our cash pulling arrangements. For GAAP reporting, other non-operating income includes unrealized gains from our investment in ChemoCentryx. Moving further down the P&L, our adjusted effective tax rate in Q4 was 21.4%, similar to the prior year in what we expect for the foreseeable future. Turning to cash flow and return of capital, $44.8 million of cash was generated from operations in the quarter, down 20% over Q4 of last year and consistent with our adjusted earnings. In Q4, our net investment in capital expenditures was $17.3 million, primarily driven by construction of our new GMP protein factory, which remains on schedule for completion by the end of the calendar year. During Q4, we returned capital to shareholders with $12.3 million of dividends. We finished the fiscal year with 39.7 million average diluted shares outstanding. For the full fiscal year, cash flow from operations was $205.2 million, up 13% from our fiscal 2019 result. Our net investment in capital expenditures was $51.7 million, consisting of $24.1 million in baseline CapEx and a $27.6 million investment in our GMP protein facility. Our balance sheet remains very strong with $270.9 million in cash in short-term available-for-sale investments and our total leverage ratio of well under one time EBITDA. Our total leverage is at the lowest level since before the 2014 acquisition of ProteinSimple. Next I\u2019ll discuss the performance of our reporting segments, starting with Protein Sciences. Q4 reported sales were $127.3 million, with reported revenue decreasing 11%. Organic growth also decreased 11% with foreign exchange and acquisitions having a negligible impact on revenue growth. Within this segment, product lines with higher academic exposure, namely our reagent solutions portfolio, experienced significant headwinds. As Chuck mentioned, we had an exceptional quarter in both the Biologics and Simple Plex instrument platforms, which partially offset the impact of lab closures due to the pandemic. Operating margin for the Protein Sciences segment was 38.9%, a decrease of 650 basis points year-over-year due primarily to the unfavorable volume leverage and to a lesser extent, unfavorable product mix. Turning to the Diagnostics and Genomics segment. Q4 reported sales $48.7 million, relatively flat with the prior year results. Organically, revenues grew 1%, with foreign exchange translation having an unfavorable 1% impact on revenue. Within this segment, our Diagnostic Reagent division increased mid single-digits with strong COVID-19 related raw material tailwinds benefiting the business. Meanwhile, our Genomics division, which like our Research Solutions Division and Protein Sciences has a large exposure to the academic market and took the biggest COVID-related hit in this segment with a double-digit percentage decline in sales in Q4. However, as labs gradually started to open throughout the quarter and into July, we\u2019ve also seen Genomics performance dramatically improve. Additionally, we anticipate the launch of micro RNAscope, increased penetration of high-plex and continue adoption of RNAscope for COVID-19 applications to positively contribute to growth going forward. Finally, Exosome Diagnostics Q4 revenue increased over 80% from last year, with higher collections from Medicare, private payers and patients as well as progress with biopharma partnerships driving the year-over-year increase. Keep in mind that Exosome is still on a cash basis for revenue recognition, so collections from pre-pandemic test help recorded sales in the quarter. Moving on to operating margin for the Diagnostics and Genomics segment, at 12.4%, the segment\u2019s operating margin improved from 10.3% reported in the prior year. The increase reflects stable volume leverage in our Diagnostics Reagents division less dilution from Exosome Diagnostics as well as strong cost management. Before we turn the call over to Q&A, I will share our current perspective of our view ahead. First, and most importantly our strategic financial goals for the next three to five years remain unchanged. Our novel automated protein analytical capabilities, our cutting-edge tissue and liquid biopsy technologies, our tool kit of cell and gene therapy manufacturing solutions, together with our core world-class protein reagents, are as well positioned as ever to help our customers advance the study of life sciences. And we believe in a post-COVID world, the need to advance the study of life sciences will be greater than ever before. This does \u2013 this gives us even greater confidence in achieving our long-term financial goals. But first, our customers, namely life science researchers and diagnostic practitioners need to all get back to work. This is starting to happen as our monthly pacing of sales recovery within Q4 made clear. However, there are still too many unknowns about what the impact of the pandemic and any potential vaccines will have in our lives this fall and winter. This uncertainty prevents us from giving a view on our full fiscal year 2021 financial performance with any sort of confidence intervals. So we are managing our outlook month-by-month, quarter-by-quarter, staying nimble to deploy resources for the needs of our customers as they arise. As a reminder, our first quarter of fiscal year 2020 was very strong and will likely be the toughest comparable for the upcoming year. Thus holding flat year-over-year in Q1 on both the top and bottom lines, we see as the right trajectory to keep us on track to our long-term plan. The downside risk to this trajectory would be a pause or reversal in our customers going back to work due to a worsening of the pandemic. An upside of this trajectory would be regulatory approval of our quantitative COVID serology assay test coupled with an early successful commercial launch. That concludes my prepared comments. And with that I\u2019ll turn the call back over the operator to open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Puneet Souda with SVB Leerink. Please proceed with your question. Puneet Souda : Thanks. Thanks, Chuck. So first question is on guide, if you can just elaborate a little bit on the first quarter scenario here that you\u2019re presenting flat. Just trying to get a better understanding of what sort of trends are you seeing in July that give you this view? Or is there \u2013 one would have expected the academic labs to continue to improve. And if we do so \u2013 slightly better than flat, is that not something that is doable despite the tough comps here. This is my first question and I have a few follow-ups. Chuck Kummeth : Sure. Well, first and foremost, we finished this last quarter still down 8% and it could have been worse than that. We did have a tailwind. The tailwind\u2019s improving. We\u2019re seeing a resurgence in July, not \u2013 towards this summer we saw with China coming back on. So July numbers are a very good start, as Jim alluded to. But there\u2019s two months to go, and we have a 13% comp from last year to cover. So that\u2019s the big one. So coming back from negative coming this quarter in a tough comp, we think flat, we could give a range. We were 9% or 10% minus 20% last quarter. We talked about saying something from zero to 10% or something or a minus 5% to plus 5%. But I think the best thing is to keep this tight as we can. We think flat\u2019s the right trajectory for us. And if there are upsides \u2013 now if we stay with what we see in July, continue into the whole quarter, I think there\u2019ll be upside. I agree we did see it in China. We saw things level off, and expect to see things level out here, too. I mean, we\u2019re seeing a really strong start in the quarter. And it\u2019s just probably not plausible. Not to mention there are hotspots and resurgence going on, and they\u2019re just very unpredictable what\u2019s going to happen. I know that I looked at the numbers this morning and looks very encouraging in the U.S. for the numbers this week but who is to say it. So I think on top of the comp, I think flat is right. Europe continues to progress to be a little bit ahead of us. UK is the only real out liar here, and we\u2019ll have to watch and see what happens there. And in China, it\u2019s actually a little bit going the wrong direction right now, right? So if that gets worse, we\u2019ll see. India and others are not as bad as I would have thought, given their population and their ability to actually deal with this, but that\u2019s a good thing. And then on top of all this, there\u2019s upside on our COVID, right? So if we get our EUA in two to four weeks, and we get a solid month of coming out with this product, that\u2019s really not in our numbers, in this forecast. So there\u2019s upside. We have other COVID products as well. Simple Plex, we talked about had just an amazing quarter, and it\u2019s looking like it\u2019s going to continue maybe not quite at 100% growth, but darn good growth I guarantee you. So we need academia to come back, we need urologists to come back, and the progression has started, but it\u2019s not \u2013 they\u2019re not all the way back even at the end of this quarter, we don\u2019t think so. We\u2019re going to stay cautious. We don\u2019t officially give guidance. This is the closest we\u2019ve ever come, and we\u2019re talking about staying flat against a strong comp, that\u2019s all. That gives you something, Puneet. Puneet Souda : Yes. Thanks. I appreciate the details there. And my next question is serology. I think this is a question that we\u2019ve been getting from investors as well. What is your expectation here for contribution from serology in fiscal year 2021? And I\u2019m asking that because COVID serology market has lagged significantly behind the PCR market given that PCRs more has essentially more diagnostic capabilities. Obviously, serology is only giving you a snapshot in time. So \u2013 and some of the peer companies have also lowered their expectations in serology significantly going into the next quarter. So I\u2019m wondering what are you baking in for serology? And what gives you confidence that you can grow sort of above the market here in serology? Chuck Kummeth : Sure. Well, I want to give you some comments here, and they\u2019re really meant for everybody, not just you. So I\u2019m not going to cover the same ground here, and then questions later and that we will get this out kind of to all of you at once just to be really careful. We\u2019ve invested a lot in our test. We have submitted a one hell of a dossier to the FDA, let me tell you. And it is an incredible data package. We have gone far and beyond, really what the FDA requires for something like this. As you know, it\u2019s a two-step. When we decided to go fully quantitative a couple of months ago and take a step back and take some extra time, the FDA, first of all, was starting to get clogged up with an awful lot of request. Two, being we\u2019re talking about asking for a fully quantitative EUA and nobody else has done that that. And they really, really asked for an awful lot of extra stuff, extra data, extra testing. We have complete sensitivity data done. We did crossed reactivity test against 14 major diseases. We have stats on all this that are phenomenal. We know of nothing out there that compares, but we don\u2019t maybe know everything that\u2019s coming out either. So we\u2019re only talking what\u2019s out there now. We do also know and the FDA, regrettably so, knows that they\u2019ve issued a lot of preliminary EUAs that they probably regret and a lot of these initial qualitative tests have become a tarnish to the whole serology potential. And we have to overcome that. But we\u2019re very sure and we\u2019re very clear on the fact there\u2019s a need for a quantitative serology test that really can identify the level of immunity in a patient. And this is going to be important. More and more important as these vaccines come in the market, and patients who want to know, are they having a response or not. And so we see a surveillance side of this, it\u2019s going to only grow, and it\u2019s not going away in a year. So will it match the \u2013 are you sick now testing environment to PCR, maybe not. But it\u2019s going to be a very large market, and we\u2019re not a very big company, and we\u2019re going to have the best test, at least for a while. So we\u2019re very confident that we\u2019re going to be treated very fairly by the FDA, and we\u2019ll be out there before this quarter end, hopefully. But there\u2019s no guarantee. This is the FDA, and there are hundreds of tests out there, trying to get in, in all different forms. We know of nothing else out there that can match us. We had incredible partners with Kantaro and then Mount Sinai. They are managing most of the bureaucracy here being \u2013 we\u2019re not that experienced at it. And we\u2019ve got great consultants on the staff through Kantaro as well who\u2019ve really taken control of our dossier and our package, our data, everything. Our team here at Bio-Techne has worked around the clock for months now and has really fulfilled their mission, we feel. And we\u2019re ready to go. And we\u2019re not kidding, we\u2019re ready to go at millions per month, if not millions per week. So \u2013 but you\u2019re right. Right now, it\u2019s kind of a 10% kind of market demand compared to PCR, but we think it\u2019ll improve. And it will improve with the test getting better with vaccines coming on the market and the economy is opening up, and people want to go back to work, and knowing they\u2019re safe to go back to work. So we\u2019re ready. We\u2019ve been waiting for this, and we\u2019re ready. Puneet Souda : Thanks. That\u2019s very helpful. And my last one is on Cell and Gene Therapy. This is obviously an important growth driver in new market opening for you here for the next few years. So when is the earliest we can see the revenue in that? And maybe if you can provide some details or anything we should be modeling? And how should we be looking for that in 2021? And if you could also provide any updated thoughts on the level of interest you\u2019re seeing and early commitments to \u2013 for the capacity that you are building out in the first year? If you could provide some color there, that would be helpful. Thank you. Chuck Kummeth : Well, as you know, we\u2019re selling GMP proteins now. We\u2019re just not selling in larger batches. So our GMP protein business is growing and growing near 100%. So we\u2019ll be moving all of that over to the facility once we are able to. So we\u2019re on schedule, on budget. We\u2019ll be opening the facility in late September, qualifying for the rest of this calendar year and be open for business for scaled out production revenue, probably in January or something. We have a one completed, signed up large customer, and we are in negotiations with half a dozen others. And behind that are a lot more others on preclinicals and testing and people getting ready to check us out. So it\u2019s hard to guess right now what that first year revenue will be coming out of the factory, but it\u2019s certainly going to be significant. We will not show our capacity for first year. We\u2019ve never said we would be. Probably say, it could take as long as five years to a full $140 million. We don\u2019t think it will take that long, but it could. Our models don\u2019t go beyond that. So it\u2019ll only be upside. So we\u2019re ready to expand it to a $200 million model. And it takes about a six-month to one year window to do that. So we think we have ample time. We\u2019ve got ample room in the building. We\u2019ve got ample green space. So no issues there. Equipment is all here. The site looks phenomenal. We\u2019re going to have a fantastic viewing quarter for the processes. Our local Minnesota Science Museum, who is the world or the country leader in exhibition design, they say this is for sale, they\u2019re going to help us design how to exhibit and how to show the processes. So it will be a great venue for customers to come in and see what they can expect. And it\u2019s going to be fun. So everything is on track. The numbers don\u2019t \u2013 haven\u2019t changed since we\u2019ve told you before really, so. Jim Hippel : Puneet, the other thing I\u2019ll add with regards to the GMP factory itself in terms of the revenue generated from it. Aside from just the growth in our normal clinical business, as Chuck mentioned, where it\u2019s growing at 100% for GMP proteins, these large customer deals that we either signed or are in negotiations with right now, they\u2019re all in various phases of clinicals right now. They are not commercializing themselves yet. So the reality is until they get through their Phase 3 and commercialize, we really won\u2019t have a good view of the timing of when we\u2019ll see that major step-up in revenue from those customers. Chuck Kummeth : And these are ones that aren\u2019t really out there out or coming out. As you know, there\u2019s an awful lot of viral vector based cell therapies coming out the next year or two. And we\u2019re not really \u2013 we\u2019re not in those clinicals. But being we\u2019re not part of the drug, it would take just equivalency testing to actually move over our protein if it\u2019s deemed to be a better value, better quality, et cetera. So we expect, as we open, we\u2019ll get more and more interest from dozens and dozens of cell therapies that will be coming over the next two to three years. That\u2019s our angle anyway. Puneet Souda : That\u2019s great. Thanks for the detail. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Catherine Schulte with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Catherine Schulte : Thanks for the question. I guess, first, just on China, great to see that strong return to growth in the quarter. You talked about seeing that reverse to some extent. I guess what\u2019s implied for China and the flat overall guide for the first quarter? Chuck Kummeth : We don\u2019t see anything below double-digit forever in China, to be honest. So we\u2019ve almost got to that the last quarter. So we were at 24% this quarter. The resurgence is a big part of that. I think we\u2019d probably be north of 20% if we didn\u2019t see the new shutdowns in Beijing and other things. But with that in case, it\u2019s kind of unknown. But I think we still see a strong 15-ish kind of number at least. We\u2019re hoping for better. You never know with China, it\u2019s not going to be below double digit, but it could still be over 20% as well. Catherine Schulte : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And with everything you have going on the Diagnostics side and also in vaccine and therapeutic development, is it possible to quantify what kind of COVID related tailwinds you saw in the quarter and how you expect those to trend going forward? Chuck Kummeth : Yes. Well, we had 5% this last quarter, right? And that\u2019s going to improve modestly with the current products like Ella and our RNAscope continues to see some traction. We\u2019re selling reagents, we\u2019re even selling antibodies to other test manufacturers, antibodies that we\u2019re not using in our test, of course. So we\u2019re a full-service build supplier to everybody, right? That\u2019s what we do. I think the big upset, of course, is the serology traction. If we get the EUA, these aren\u2019t going to be small orders. If we get this, there\u2019ll be all the large orders and we\u2019re talking with a lot of large institutions. I will make a comment now to \u2013 I mean, the commercial channel and as I mentioned before, it\u2019s one thing to be able to make five to 10 million tests a week. It\u2019s another to get in the engine of doing five to 10 million blood draws a week, and that\u2019s the mission here. So, we\u2019ve got to be working with governments, with large reference labs, the vaccine makers, the hospital management systems out there that are really managing all these labs and working all these blood draws for all these automated testing that goes on every day in the hospitals and clinics around the world. So that\u2019s where we\u2019re really working on now have been for a couple of months already, we are definitely beyond term sheets with some and there is a lot of interest as you can imagine. So, but that\u2019s what\u2019s going to drive the speed of traction and the level of traction, not only this quarter but come Q2 and beyond. Catherine Schulte : Great. And then maybe just one model cleanup question for Jim, recognizing on the specific guidance, but how should we think about sequential OpEx changes in the coming quarter. And how quickly you\u2019re planning on bringing back some of that SG&A spend? Charles Kummeth : Yes, I\u2019d say from a sequential perspective, it will be perhaps a little bit of uplift, if nothing else, because we \u2013 the first quarter is when our annual merit increases, for example, it kick in, but it\u2019s going to be fairly minimal. We\u2019re obviously still in a mode of being very tight on our discretionary spend, really not investing in any \u2013 much in the way, any new hires at this point. So, we\u2019re still being very, very careful with regards to our investment. So, I would just say nominal sequential spend from Q4 to Q1. We\u2019re really on a kind of flat \u2013 kind of keeping any things of that growth. As you remember, Catherine, we spent a lot of time and we\u2019re in Minneapolis so, finding top talent from the Bay Area or Boston to come here for biotech, research and work it\u2019s difficult. So, we\u2019ve done acquisitions in these better locations and we really worked hard to building a world-class team over the last six, seven years. We don\u2019t see this pandemic as more than a one year to two year bubble of the real pain and the last thing we wanted to do was to ruin our team. So, we decided to [indiscernible] it up and not do any furloughing. We didn\u2019t do any restructuring. So, we could have delivered more to the bottom line. You saw our tremendous results. So, I mean, that speaks to the tight processes we have here as an operating team. We run a very, very good template of processes, both weekly, monthly and quarterly. We know we\u2019re spending and why. We prioritize continually. We were able to pivot a large percentage of the company towards our pandemic related \u2013 COVID related activities, and yet we still had almost near typical year-on-year NPI for products. So, we\u2019ve done a great job there. And the lot of it came from taking the pressure off our team, them not worrying about going on furloughs or being restructured, so it\u2019s steady as she goes here. That said, they are all watching what we spent and if we do have any attrition where we replace if needed then we certainly aren\u2019t doing expansion in areas, other than these mission critical areas. We are, of course, adding in operations for expected ramp-up for our serology test is one example. We are certainly ramping up around Ella with 100% growth in Simple Plex, but we\u2019re going to have resources. We\u2019ve told China, you\u2019re back to 24% growth. You know what you can hire. But to hire you have to grow, and we were not growing, we\u2019re not hiring. Catherine Schulte : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Arias with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Dan Arias : Good morning, guys. Thanks. Want to ask a couple of reimbursement questions if I could. First Chuck on to serology, you had talked mid quarter about the potential for a reimbursement rate that involved I think secondary pricing was the way that you phrased which might have sort of a greater level of an incentivization that\u2019s attached to it for the lab. Is that something that you still think is in the picture? And then on Exosome, specific to the commercial side of that business, I\u2019m curious whether a, the clinical utility study is helping negotiations there? And then if I go back to some of the things that you were talking about this time last year. It sounded like that you guys were having some good success in just keeping the private payer rates from being too far \u2013 not too far from the CMS rate. Is that what you expect going forward? Do you think there is some discounting that comes into the picture in order to sort of bag some of those bigger payers? Chuck Kummeth : Well, let\u2019s work in reverse order. So the payer situation is still improving at the acceptable levels. The utility study is being acknowledged and being well received and it\u2019s helping us line up bigger payers. The Medicare is still coming back and growing. I think we\u2019re on track and then NGS, of course, is very excited about getting back to us on reconsideration. They actually love the utility study. And we\u2019re going to be following up with some other data here soon, but I think, of course, they don\u2019t meet every month. So, we\u2019ve got plenty of time till it is fall and to get the package really in good place for a reconsideration. That said the TRF process it\u2019s really helped us get around that being a potential shortfall with the limited definition to the LCD, but we\u2019re okay, I think for now. So it\u2019s kind of steady as she goes. We had great growth and we continue to see it in the at-home test, I think is really a sleeper. I mean that thing is going to allow free take off. And then, stay tuned; we\u2019ve got some new coming advertising campaigns that are also going to be I think well received. So, we\u2019re moving well along there. What was your question before that? That was... Jim Hippel : Serology. Dan Arias : In serology and the way in which reimbursement might work there and whether or not labs have a more of a incentive to use it? Chuck Kummeth : Yes. So we did submit to CMS for a CPT-code a special and we got it. We have a new code, but we don\u2019t have pricing at and we can get the pricing until the EUA is out. And so it all works together. Clearly what we will do a crosswalk at some point with CMS when it\u2019s appropriate and that may follow the EUA, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any issue, any worries about that. And it is significantly higher than the $42 charge for a one-step test out there currently. I think when people see the extra difficulty \u2013 the technical hurdles are here. The more information, the better results where Kantaro, Mount Sinai for sure are very confident that we\u2019re going to be dealt fairly. Anyhow we need all this because, for the channel to accept this and drive it and prioritize it, there has to be a little more, because it costs more. Dan Arias : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks, Chuck. And then just maybe on the Ella business. It sounds like you had a strong quarter that you were expecting there. Can you kind of just talk about demand by customer class? I\u2019m curious about pharma usage and then maybe on the clinical side, how likely are you thinking that it is that becomes sort of go to platform for day-to-day patient testing and management as it comes to running the ELISA assays if that time does come? Chuck Kummeth : Well, I\u2019ve often spoke about it being the big sleeper in our stable. And the micropoint opportunity in China is just one indication that\u2019s a $100 million obtained all by itself. So love to have some of those over here. We\u2019re having a lot more interest. This will be event that that platform really has been waiting for. We had a lot \u2013 we basically sold all we can make this last quarter and I don\u2019t know if that will continue, because we\u2019re ramping our production now. But we certainly saw insurgence for hospital use and for testing use and I think there is interest now there for people to take that application and take it through different clinical regulatory needs. And we\u2019ll see, but it\u2019s good for regulatory. It\u2019s good, it\u2019s good, it\u2019s good for clinicians, it\u2019s good in research. It\u2019s a high-speed multiplex immunoassay one hour sample data, it\u2019s wonderful. And we keep building the panel library for it and we\u2019re able to make panels that will for anybody. We have an open cartridge panel for people, who do their own work and this is important for Biopharma, because they want to work a little more secretive. So, they\u2019ve taken it and they\u2019re working on their own products without us pretty being involved and later they\u2019ll come back and tell us what to make for them and it really buttoned out. So, we see a big strong future for Ella in the Simple Plex platform in general, and there\u2019s more culture coming. We have a variety that\u2019s coming out and going smaller and smaller too. So, it could be a point of care as well. 4/8 is an example. Dan Arias : Yes. Okay. And then just maybe, one more if I could stick one in here on Europe, You\u2019re \u2013 you usually have some pretty good views on just high-level funding. I\u2019m curious what you think about the European funding situation with the rise in Europe. The budget seems like it\u2019s coming in a little bit lower than maybe, they were hoping for. Is that something that you think is impactful going forward or is it really about the portfolio over there and just being position right? Chuck Kummeth : I think it\u2019s more about positioning and we\u2019re not that big a player. So, we really haven\u2019t seen any impact. It could be Simple Plex Ella is a good example. That was just off the charts over there for us. They need, especially in places like Italy. Right now, no concerns on funding for our products or budgets in Europe. It\u2019s more about getting UK back online in full. The rest of the country is really coming on just fine. Dan Arias : Yes. Okay. Chuck Kummeth : If anything, to start \u2013 if anything, we just need to get back to where we were before COVID and that was the reorganization, the restructuring, the new commercial designs that we had for Europe in general. We made most of those changes and we\u2019re kind of waiting for Europe to come back to normal, so we can actually measure how we did. So, places like Germany, there should be a lot more upside. So, we\u2019re looking at investing and expanding in places like Germany, where we should have more business, to be honest. Dan Arias : I am 100% on board is getting back to where we were before COVID. So, good luck to all of us on that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Patrick Donnelly : Thanks. Chuck, maybe, just on the academic market, just kind of wondering how that trended throughout the quarter, I know you\u2019ve given in the past, the metrics like percentage of labs that were open versus closed in areas like the U.S. Anything you can kind of help us think about exit rate and then as we kind of trend through this quarter what you think about the flattish guidance, what your expectations are for that market? Chuck Kummeth : Yes. Well, we\u2019ve read all the public stuff, just like you guys have or writing and I think roughly 50%, 60% are partially open and a roughly a quarter open and the rest are kind of in the middle and unknown, but we are hoping for better than that, we all were, right. So, I think it\u2019s just a slow slog forward. I think there are two camps for academic labs. There\u2019s ones that are well funded through grants and there is ones that are funded to the universities, and where students not coming back or international students not coming back, I think you\u2019re going to see some constrained budget in some university labs probably. I think the grant related labs are probably going to be fine and probably, it will be a great season next year, because we see nothing but improvements in funding to that end. So, we just have to kind of go work with it. By definition, labs are kind of socially distant. They aren\u2019t really in top line out there and I think labs will come on back on board before really students are back at full strength. And I\u2019ve read that in more than one place, so \u2013 but it varies by institution. So, they\u2019re just not all the same. And if you\u2019re going to \u2013 if you\u2019re asking for an answer of what\u2019s the mean of all this, they\u2019re coming back. But they are coming back slower than we\u2019d like. And I expect that the budget situation going forward, it may be a wash as I think you\u2019re going to see some things better than usual and some things less, netting out to be, it\u2019s my guess. But I don\u2019t know any more than you do on that. So, we have \u2013 we may be better off in a lot of companies. We have a lot of products that are really kind of unique and only ones in the world and you got to get it from us. And so they\u2019re coming back fast. We\u2019ve had, as I mentioned, a very strong start to the quarter. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re alone there. And I think it\u2019s somewhat similar to what we saw in China. People have come back to labs. They remember what they did and turn the lights off two, three months ago and they are reordering quickly to get their stuff back going again and that will level off probably after the first month or two we think, just like it did in China and \u2013 but research isn\u2019t going away. And we\u2019ll just have to work with them as best as they are coming back online. But for academic labs to be healthy, we need students and we need all kinds of students including international students and that\u2019s a big question mark right now. Patrick Donnelly : Yes. I appreciate that. And then maybe, on the serology tests, I know one of the angles you guys had that makes your test all unique is, you can kind of play in the vaccine development, see if vaccines are effective with the antibodies were generated. I guess how do you see that opportunity playing out again, whether it\u2019s over the next year? Are you already in conversations with whether it\u2019s pharma companies or whoever the end user could be there? Can you just talk through that opportunity? Obviously, it seems like it would be pretty significant as the vaccine.... Chuck Kummeth : Yes. Serology in high volumes for the math is different than serology for the vaccine manufacturer. They would be probably a few million dollars at least per account to be really in their clinicals per se, any part of it. but a lot of those ships have left their docks, right. they are in Phase IIs and Phase IIIs, a lot of them done their own test. Now, they\u2019re not scaling up something for the world. So, they\u2019re probably not as focused on a monoclonal like we were. They can use other ways that means that they\u2019ve got something to test, so that something they can\u2019t really release to the world. So, we\u2019re in the middle of all those kinds of discussions and I think as we get out there with the data and the accuracy of our test, I think we\u2019re going to get more and more support, and the interest from the vaccine makers. And yes, we are working with some already, but not all of them and we\u2019d ask pretty much all of them. And then that\u2019s the answer we\u2019d gotten that they would like to take a look, but they are in the middle of stop obviously, and they\u2019ve got big deadlines to hit with their Phase II or Phase III, in some cases, and it\u2019s now is not the time to be changing how they\u2019re testing. So, there is some of that. But it was mentioned in the \u2013 in our response \u2013 in our transcript here that surveillance going forward is going to become more and more important and we see a lot of that going well beyond just vaccine manufacturers, so... Patrick Donnelly : Sure. Chuck Kummeth : But we got to get around \u2013 first of all, the port tests that came out in the last six months, right. Patrick Donnelly : Absolutely. And Jim, maybe just a quick one on the capital allocation side. Obviously, uncertain times here, how conservative you guys want to be, or is this a time to be a little more opportunistic on areas like M&A just wondering your view here? Jim Hippel : Yes. I think we definitely took a more conservative approach last quarter \u2013 last quarter and a half as the pandemic started to become more of a reality to understand how deep it was and we took actions to build up cash, pay down debt. So, we are extremely well positioned right now from the balance sheet perspective and a cash flow perspective going forward. And as we\u2019ve mentioned in past calls, we\u2019re always involved in M&A discussions and looking at targets and fielding targets and we are currently as well, and just a matter of the right target, the right price, the right time. So it\u2019s not a matter of financial wherewithal or conservatism that\u2019s holding us back. Patrick Donnelly : Great. thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jacob Johnson with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Jacob Johnson : Hey, thanks. Chuck, you touched on it, but maybe, expanding on this. Just on the GMP proteins, was the initial demand here be for relatively early stage therapies or can GMP proteins to be implemented in later stage trials or even a commercially approved therapy? And then how does the demand for these proteins ramp as these therapies move their clinical trials and maybe, what would a commercial approval mean for you in terms of proteins \u2013 GMP protein revenues? Chuck Kummeth : Well, we have one large signed customer now, where I mentioned we\u2019re in negotiation half dozen others and that one would be millions and millions of dollars of proteins, just that one. We have had inquiries for orders as large as annually of $10 million or more expected while there was some so much more pressure on us to get in the game and get going on large capacity available proteins the GMP, because they were scared to death, where they were going to get them and it\u2019s going to probably drive be one of the big drivers of just how fast the cell and gene therapy market in general growth is going to be the safety of these reagents. So we plan to be not only in the game, but the leader. To the first part of your question, we\u2019re in what kind. It will be all the above. So yes, we have our all complete workflow non-viral vector related and we\u2019re in pre-clinicals with a lot of companies working direction. We think five, 10 years out here, the world will probably be non-viral vector, but there are, a thousand clinicals right now that are viral vector related and summer coming out at the other end here very soon in a couple have already and for them to use our proteins, they have to do [indiscernible] test of which they\u2019ll be doing. I\u2019m sure. And it\u2019s very possible and then it\u2019s going to come down to how well our product works and what\u2019s the price et cetera. So we\u2019re going to get pieces of all of these markets. And I think the biggest first big upside would be equivalency. So if we can land some of these accounts that are coming out and going into production through [indiscernible] test that would be the biggest short-term upside. Otherwise, we really get to wait for our stuff to kind of get through their clinicals with our partners in the other end which is going to be in two to three years, which we\u2019ve talked about at length, but we see a J-curve with this, factory in terms of revenue ramp and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll have significant revenue next year, but it\u2019s hard to say. It will certainly be probably more north of $10 million, but it will be north of $50 million. It\u2019s hard to say for year one. But\u2026 Jacob Johnson : Got it. That\u2019s helpful and maybe just one other question on Cell and Gene therapy. You\u2019ve talked about a lot of the opportunities here. But can you talk about the application of the ACD technology for cell and gene therapy. It seems like this technology can be used in the viral vector and CAR T workflow? Chuck Kummeth : Yes. It\u2019s in the workflow, I mean it\u2019s spatial imaging, right. So we have a single cell analysis. So at some point you do that we\u2019ll look at the sales and see how things are working and RNAscope is fantastic for that. So we\u2019re going to have Plex versions of this as well. We have our high-plex out now. So we see a big future for RNAscope platform being used in cell and gene therapy as an analysis tool. Jacob Johnson : Got it. Thanks for taking the questions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Nowak with Craig-Hallum Capital Group. Please proceed with your question. Alex Nowak : Hey, good morning, everyone. A lot has been asked on the serology test, but I just want to ask a couple of clarifications. Who is going to be marketing and actually selling that serology testing for the clinical side of the market. Are you going to be using traditional diagnostic distributor for this. And can you just give us any sort of the economics of the test back to Bio-Techne after paying out for Mount Sinai and the distributors and such. Chuck Kummeth : Well, lots going to depend on what kind of to real demand will happen. So as an example, we have to convince this channel the LabCorp class all these different [indiscernible] lab into use test. Now we are in the middle of using high automated systems right now from other manufacturers, but on, not a less desirable test. The reimbursement on that 42 on a single step test will be asking for more and to get more is going to help prioritize of them. So, we\u2019re in discussions with all the entire channel there everyone, you mentioned and more. So there are companies that manage the hospital labs, there is LabCorp and Quest, of course, there is a second-tier level of LabCorp and Quest out there is the mail. And then there is a vaccine manufacturers in general to there\u2019s biotech in as well as a channel for a lot of stuff, so we\u2019re talking to all of them. There are governments that are talking to us mean there are, there are governments that are talking to us about that are more or less social medicine type of model that want to buy big and they want to get in on this. So we\u2019re discussing that with some as well. So, we\u2019re getting help non-China is very influential. The Kantaro Group as got people on board that have a lot of experience working in these areas and these channels and dealing with the FDA, but it will be commercialized by us that\u2019s what we are going to do with this. The branding, on the product will have R&D \u2013 powered by R&D systems, branded on the product and what we get out of it, I\u2019ve mentioned before that we\u2019re going to be certainly be in the $5 to $10 range, we think, in us and Mount Sinai. But you know the test prices will go, much higher than that and they are already \u2013 they are now, even in a single step. So we\u2019ll get more than that. That should create strong interest from the I\u2019ll call it the channel, so to speak. The people who are managing, all those blood draws that won\u2019t be form. And again, Alex, we\u2019re not trying to take out Roche here, we\u2019re not very big. So I mean any \u2013 the traction we expect here should be very material to us. Alex Nowak : No, I understood. I appreciate the commentary there. Just any update on more thing Exosome Diagnostics more of picks and shovels business as you\u2019ve mentioned in the past or partnerships and just where do you stand on the pipeline with the bladder cancer tests in the kidney transplant test? Chuck Kummeth : We\u2019re pretty far along there on the kidney rejection test. We have the first paper review and data is there and we\u2019re working toward that through that process. I mean I think another year. So we\u2019ll probably be into the guidelines and work in the same kind of process we did with the EPI test. Bladder is probably following that. It\u2019s just a matter of bandwidth. Our partnership ideas for that one as well, and there we\u2019re pretty far along in partnerships discussions both with EPI as well as the blood based versions of this test of which need clinicals done et cetera. And there is a global perspective too. There are different other partners that want to really help in Europe and also want to help in Asia for us. So I would say some things have slowed down due to the pandemic, for sure. We definitely have taken a hit but recovering faster than expected with our own urology office in the U.S., and I think at-home is going to be very instrumental and coming back and coming back strong this year and then continue the trajectory that we expect. So this is a big platform. It\u2019s got a lot of aspects to it. It\u2019s going to take years to really get it to mainstream, but there is nothing that can beat it. We don\u2019t think so. We\u2019re on our way. Alex Nowak : Okay. Got it. And then just a follow-up question to the GMP side and the whole focus on non-viral vector. What do you need to do to win over pharma that the non-viral vector growth is the right way that they should do this. I mean essentially, you said five, 10 years, everyone is going to be going your way. Is it you convincing pharma or is it pharma essentially doing trial and error finding out that you\u2019re method is the most optimal. What really can do that pharma to switch over? Chuck Kummeth : It\u2019s data, cost, productivity. There is no doubt in anyone\u2019s mind it\u2019s tested with our platform that some more efficient. It\u2019s less costly, it\u2019s much more predictable and reproducible. Viral vectors are hard to work with that should become a standard over the last decade, because that\u2019s how it was. But like everything lot of things in the world, the first isn\u2019t always the best. The world comes around and frames up something better, but it\u2019s going to really have to get there with data. The pre-clinicals and the work we\u2019re doing have been very successful. We\u2019re selling a fair amount of stuff already to be honest. And we see a bright future. But this is \u2013 as you are well aware, this is not an overnight kind of market capacity to be methodical approach toward clinicals. And I think it\u2019s doing just fine, it will get there. Alex Nowak : All right. Understood. Thank you. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I\u2019d like to turn the floor back over to the management for any closing remarks. Chuck Kummeth : Well, again, it was a tough quarter by \u2013 for us and for everyone else in the industry. We \u2013 I think we came out better than expected and we\u2019re very happy with what we see so far. And going forward, we see nothing but a bright future. So, we\u2019ll look forward telling you more next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s web conference. You may now disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Bio-Techne Earnings Conference Call for the First Quarter of Fiscal Year 2021. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. And the call will be open for questions following management\u2019s prepared remarks. During our Q&A session, please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. I would now like to turn the call over to David Clair, Bio-Techne's Senior Director, Investor Relations and Corporate Development. David Clair : Good morning. And thank you for joining us. On the call with me this morning are Chuck Kummeth, Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Hippel, Chief Financial Officer of Bio-Techne. Before we begin, let me briefly cover our safe harbor statement. Some of the comments made during this conference call may be considered forward-looking statements, including beliefs and expectations about the company's future results as well as the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and financial results. The company's 10-K for fiscal year 2020 identifies certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements made during this call. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of any new information or future events or developments. The 10-K as well as the company's other SEC filings are available on the company's website within its Investor Relations section. During the call, non-GAAP financial measures may be used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance, tables reconciling these measures to most comparable GAAP measures are available in the company's press release issued earlier this morning on the Bio-Techne Corporation website at www.bio-techne.com. I will now turn the call over to Chuck. Chuck Kummeth : Thanks, Dave. And good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter conference call. Despite the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Bio-Techne team delivered an outstanding start to fiscal 2021. Our organic growth accelerated 10% in the quarter, returning to our pre-pandemic double-digit organic growth trajectory and topping our initial expectations for flat organic growth. Our business benefited as labs continued the reopening process with researchers returning to the bench in greater numbers and restarting projects that were paused during the height of the lockdown. Our Q1 top line results are even more impressive considering the 13% comp we faced in the quarter from the prior year to 38.2%. I would note, this is our best operating margins results since our fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. This sequential and year-over-year improvement was driven by our biopharma end market and the return to growth by our academic customers. As more and more labs reopened throughout the quarter, we saw increases in both the volume of reagent orders, as well as reagent order sizes, which may be indicative of summary stocking activity as researchers return to work. What we are learning from our customers is that when they return to work, as you might expect, the lab environment is not always the same as it was pre-COVID. For example, researchers are often on staggered shifts, which means not as much physical timing be spent in the labs as before, and our sharing lab instruments may not be conducive to social distancing requirements. Thus, our lab productivity tools were also seeing follow-on purchases of these automation tools from existing customers that previously use them in a shared lab, but are now buying them for specific departments within their research organization. This surge in lab productivity tools extends beyond our protein instrument platforms and into our genomic assays as well. We have an often - we have often marketed our RNA scope assay as a tool to find a gene of interest in a sample before hunting for the express protein using antibodies. More than ever, this message is resonating with researchers. In the current environment, they have been telling us that they need to know the answer the first time, thus, we have been seeing a surge in demand for our RNA scope just as we have our automated protein platforms. Another impact of the lab environment, not being the same after research is return to work is a method in which we communicate and consult with our customers. As you can imagine, most labs are not allowing visitors on our portfolio of reagents, protein analysis tools, cell and gene therapy workflow technologies, as well as liquid and tissue biopsy solutions. Also, our commercial teams have used time save by not traveling to customer sites to aid our web support teams and uploading over 30,000 new images to what was already a best-in-class website. It is clear that effective digital outreach to our customers will remain an important component of our sales and marketing process throughout the pandemic and beyond. Supporting our digital sales and marketing efforts, we recently rolled out an enhanced Bio-Techne website experience we refer to as OneWeb. This new website brings all Bio-Techne's brands together under one easy-to-navigate site, simplifying the process of finding products of interest while driving awareness of our complete product portfolio. The OneWeb strategy also enables a single card experience for our customers and leverages enhanced algorithms to make product recommendations and drive additional cross-selling opportunities across our portfolio. We concluded a successful OneWeb soft launch in early October, and we'll be launching a full marketing campaign to coincide with the scale launch in November. Now let's discuss performance of our key growth platforms, starting with the protein sciences segment, which we grew organically by 8%. Our portfolio of protein analysis instruments, namely our simple western automated Western Blot systems, as well as our multiplexing platform, SimplePlex, had an incredibly strong quarter, growing north of 35% and 75%, respectively. As I mentioned before, the walk away automation enabled by our simple western instruments is perfectly designed for researchers in need of ways to increase productivity while partially opened. Also, we continue to expand the capabilities of our simple western platform. During the quarter, we launched the ability to analyze the same sample twice in one run in our just automated Western Blot system, a capability we call RePlex. Initial customer response to RePlex has been very strong. We also launched a multi-antigen COVID assay that enables the quantitative characterization of patient serum or plasma IgG antibodies against five SARS COV-2 antigens simultaneously in 1-3 hour RUN on both our Wes and Jess systems. With SimplePlex, Ella remains an important tool for research surrounding cytokine release syndrome in COVID-19. However, the growth was much more broad-based than COVID-19 in the quarter as we saw a significant demand from CROs and biotechnology companies for neurodegenerative diseases. We believe the high sensitivity, combined with an attractive price point, positions Ella to become an important tool in neurodegenerative research going forward. Moving on to the reagent part of our protein sciences portfolio for Q1, our core research protein and antibody sales performance improved significantly from Q4, but was still relatively flat year-over-year, as strong demand from biopharma customers was not enough to completely offset academic labs that made progress reopening, but have now got GMP protein manufacturing facility in St. Paul, Minnesota. As a reminder, this facility has capacity to produce at least $140 million in GMP proteins and reagents annually. We remain on track to complete the qualification of the facility in early calendar 2021, immediately followed by the start of the production process for commercial proteins. Over 30 years ago, we created a category of research proteins and the R&D systems brand is now synonymous with the highest level of bioactivity, quality and lot-to-lot consistency. We look forward to replicating this position in the emerging category of GMP proteins. Our JV of Fresenius Kabi and Wilson Wolf remains a key pillar in our cell and gene therapy strategy. The JV has been branded as scale-ready. And efforts are actively underway to educate the cell and gene therapy ecosystem on the complete workflow solution offered by our collective portfolio. We believe the modular workflow, which includes biotech's augmented beat-based cell separation and activation technology, non-viral vector-based gene editing technology, GMP proteins and other products paired with Fresenius Kabi's Lovo leukapheresis instrument and Wilson Wolf GRx bioreactor creates a compelling cost-effective solution necessary to accelerate broad availability and adoption of cell and gene therapies as they make their way through the FDA approval process in coming revenue over the prior year. Our Genomics division had a strong start to the fiscal year with Q1 revenue increasing over 30%, led by its RNA scope and related pharma assays services, the growth was broad-based across geographies and end markets as interest in spatial genomics paired with a single cell resolution and productivity provided by our Genomic solutions versus traditional IHC drove demand across the portfolio. During the pandemic, the ACD team made a concerted effort to educate our biopharma customer base on the pharma assay services offered by the genomics business, which enables researchers to outsource their spatial genomics analysis to us. These efforts paid off in Q1 as our PAS business grew almost 60% and allowed customers to stay on track with their research despite more limited and staggered shifts. We saw improvement as the quarter progressed. Overall, ExoDx test volumes increased over 50% sequentially and are approaching pre-COVID volumes. Our at-home test collection kit continues to have a positive impact on volumes as doctors leveraged telehealth strategies to keep their patients engaged during a pandemic. We have used the COVID-19 pandemic as an opportunity to fortify our ExoDX sales team and marketing efforts, strategically adding or replacing reps in high potential or underrepresented geographies. The impact of these moves is starting to gain traction in certain territories. For example, we are seeing positive momentum in the Northeast region, especially New York City, providing surpassed pre-COVID levels. In Q1, we also announced a very high-profile national marketing campaign with Baseball Legend and Hall of Famer, Cal Ripken Jr., to build education and awareness of the ExoDx Prostate test. We kicked off this partnership with a webinar to discuss his personal prostate cancer journey, including how the ExoDX Prostate test impacted his biopsy decision and ultimately, treatment of this condition. We are currently rolling out additional direct-to-consumer advertising with Mr. Ripken, including a sports radio advertising campaign and WebMD patient advertising. We are extremely excited to have Mr. Ripken as our spokesman and share his experience with our tests. But more importantly, we are thankful that he decided to take the ExoDX Prostate test that led him and his doctor to the potential life-saving decision to get a biopsy and catch his cancer early. Next, I'll provide a brief update on our COVID-19 initiatives. We continued to build our COVID-19 product portfolio during Q1, expanding our portfolio with multiple new reagents and assay products to help our customers improve their understanding of the disease, develop therapies and vaccines to combat the virus, as well as screen and diagnose infected patients. We estimate COVID-related research products provided a 3% uplift to growth in the quarter. Also, we received some good news last week on the COVID seroclear quantitative COVID-19 IgG antibody serology test kit. The assay received CE marking and is currently available for use by any authorized testing laboratory in the European Union. As a reminder, this novel quantitative serology assay utilizes two virus antigens correlated with antibody neutralization to provide important information regarding a patient's past infection with COVID-19 and immunity to the virus. Dialogue continues with the FDA on the issuance of an emergency use authorization, or EUA, approval for the COVID seroclear assay kit. We expect COVID-19 research to remain a life science focus for the foreseeable future, benefiting our existing COVID-19 portfolio, and we stand ready with a quantitative antibody serology offering that we believe will help people and society at large, better understand their susceptibility to contracting the virus, allowing them to make the decisions that will help keep them safe while returning to a way of life, we once all enjoyed not too long ago. Before I pass the call over to Jim, I want to give some perspective on the outcome of the recent election and how I see this impacting the life science tools broadly and more specifically, our company. Regardless of who is President, this pandemic has shown the world that preparation for pandemics is incredibly important. Layer on to this, the ongoing importance of research and oncology, discoveries that push science forward. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim. Jim Hippel : Thanks, Chuck. I will provide an overview of our Q1 fiscal '21 financial performance for the total company, provide some additional color on the performance of each of our segments and give some thoughts on the remainder of our fiscal year 2021. Starting with the overall first quarter financial performance. Adjusted EPS was $1.43 versus $1.06 one year ago, an increase of 35% over last year, with foreign exchange positively impacting EPS by $0.01. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.83 compared to $0.37 in the prior year, representing a 124% increase over the prior year. Q1 revenue was $204.2 million, an increase of 11% year-over-year on a reported basis and 10% on an organic basis. Foreign exchange translation had a favorable 1% impact on our revenue. By geography in Q1, overall growth was very similar in the US and Europe, with revenues increasing approximately 10%. Biopharma demand in both regions was very strong with growth in the high teens, while the steady reopening of University labs during the quarter allowed academia to rebound from the prior quarter and grow mid-single digits year-over-year. In Europe, the pace of the academic recovery differed by country with Germany, France and Italy all further along in the reopening process compared to the UK. However, as is the case with everything COVID-19, the situation continues to be very dynamic. Just in the past week, we have heard that these same countries are reinstating lockdowns to try to slow the followed resurgence of the virus. So far though, there is an important difference from the lockdowns that were implemented last spring, as the current restrictions do not apply to schools. It was our academic end market that suffered the most from past COVID-related shutdowns. So as long as the academic labs stay open, we believe our business in Europe will continue to ramp. In China, we grew in the upper teens organically, even though there was a resurgence of virus earlier in the quarter, inflect areas like Beijing and Hong Kong, which negatively impacted revenue for a time while labs were closed. As for the rest of Asia, organic growth increased upper single digits, with most countries rebounding to growth in the quarter, although pandemic-related shutdowns in India and Australia unfavorably impacted growth in these countries. Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin was 71.9% in the quarter compared to 69.5% in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by favorable volume leverage. Adjusted SG&A in Q1 was 25.8% of revenue, a 310 basis point decrease compared to the prior year, and R&D expense in Q1 was 7.9% of revenue, 90 basis points lower than the prior year. I do want to point out that our adjusted SG&A and R&D spend were approximately flat compared to the prior year, reflecting continued discipline on discretionary spend during the timing uncertainty of a recovery from a pandemic. This discipline includes some delayed headcount backfills and additions, given the overall improvement we are seeing in our end markets, we find to fill these positions and continue with investments to position the company for growth going forward. The resulting adjusted operating margin for Q1 was 38.2%, an increase of 640 basis points from the prior year period. Looking at our numbers below operating income. Net interest expense in Q1 was $4.2 million, decreasing $0.8 million compared to the prior year period. The decrease was due to a reduction of our bank debt during fiscal 2020, as well as lower floating rates. Our bank debt on the balance sheet as of the end of Q1 stood at $323.6 million. Other adjusted non-operating expense was $1.1 million for the quarter compared to approximately zero expense in the prior year, primarily reflecting the foreign exchange impact related to our cash pooling arrangements. For GAAP reporting, other non-operating income includes unrealized losses from our investment in ChemoCentryx. Moving down from - moving down to P&L, our adjusted effective tax rate in Q1 was 21.5%, a 40 basis point improvement over the prior year operations in the quarter, up 63% over Q1 of last year and outpacing our adjusted earnings growth. In Q1, our net investment in capital expenditures was $10.9 million, primarily driven by the construction of our new GMP protein factory. And during Q1, we returned capital to shareholders with $12.3 million of dividends. We finished Q1 with 40 million average diluted shares outstanding. Our balance sheet remains very strong with $287.4 million in cash and short-term investment. Q1 reported sales were $154.4 million, with reported revenue increasing 10%. Organic growth increased 8% with foreign exchange having a favorable impact of 2% on revenue growth. Within this segment, we experienced a broad sequential recovery within our protein sciences portfolio, although product lines with higher academic exposure, namely our reagent solutions portfolio, led the performance of our instrument platforms. As Chuck mentioned, we had an exceptional quarter in both our Simple Western and SimplePlex instrument platforms, with both product lines gaining significant traction during the pandemic. Operating margin for the protein sciences segment was 45.6%, an increase of 340 basis points year-over-year due primarily to the favorable volume leverage and cost control. Turning to the Diagnostics and Genomics segment. Q1 reported sales were $50.1 million, with reported revenue increasing 18%. Organic growth for the segment was 17%, with foreign exchange translation having a favorable 1% impact on revenue. As Chuck mentioned, our Genomics division led this segment in the quarter as our portfolio of spatial genomics products combined with the enhanced productivity offered by our tissue biopsy solutions, drove increased adoption in the current environment. We experienced strength across the entire ACD portfolio with RNA scope gaining momentum and increased interest in HiPlex, initial traction with niRNA scope and a strong performance in our pharma assay services business during the quarter. Also a driver of growth for diagnostics and genomics. Exosome Diagnostics Q1 revenue increased over 125% from last year, with higher collections from Medicare, private payers and patients driving the year-over-year increase. As Chuck mentioned in his comments, test counts are approaching pre-COVID numbers even with fewer patient visits to the urologists in the current pandemic environment. We are excited about the traction we are gaining in our direct-to-patient marketing, coupled with our differentiating capability that enables patients to take our prostate test in the comfort and safety of their own home. Moving on to operating margin for the Diagnostics and Genomics segment. At 17.3%, the segment's operating margin improved from 2.1% in the prior year. The increase reflects favorable volume leverage in our Genomics division, less dilution from Exosome Diagnostics, as well as overall strong cost management. Before we turn the call over to Q&A, I will share our current perspective of the view ahead. As Chuck described in his remarks, Bio-Techne's portfolio protein analysis instruments, innovative tissue and liquid biopsy solutions, cell and gene therapy workflow solutions and core reagents fit perfectly with the direction scientific discovery is trending, and we are positioned to ride the wave of research and discoveries going forward. As our Q1 results show, life science researchers are clearly coming back to work, although the initial pace of activity remains much stronger in the biopharma sector compared to the academic setting. We are clearly off to a strong start to our fiscal 2021, but unknowns remain. A new wave of COVID-19 outbreak is materializing across the US and Europe, representing a risk to the pace of increased research lab activity or worse, a potential of lab re-closures if lockdowns are reinstated. That said, based on our Q1 performance as well as the initial to support our strategic growth plans beyond fiscal year '21, further investment in our commercial execution and product development pipeline needs to be made. After over nine months of a pause on new investment, we intend to start making those investments once again. What that means for the remainder of the fiscal year is a likely lower adjusted operating margin than what we reported in Q1. However, we plan to finish the year with profitability that is not only higher than last year, but also higher than fiscal year '19, as we get back on track to our long-term goal of over 40% adjusted operating margin. That concludes my prepared comments. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Tachi to open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Puneet Souda of SVB Leerink. Please go ahead. Puneet Souda : Yes. Hi, Chuck, congrats on the quarter, really strong here. In terms of number of trends that you're seeing from what I'm seeing, there are - there's less protein westerns, multiplex that's doing really well. So if you could - given where we stand today, I think the key question is, what are some of those trends that will continue to be really strong in the fourth quarter and into 2021, essentially around the sustainability of those trends. So if you could maybe talk to that and just give us a sense of as the labs are opening up and despite the near term shutdowns that we're seeing in Europe, what are some of the segments where you worry a little and ones where you are more confident of continued growth? Chuck Kummeth : Sure. Thanks, Puneet. I think overall, we're seeing a great recovery. Even though we had very low single-digit growth in our reagents business, maybe there's still softness in academia. Overall, it was just such a big beat because we're just seeing a lift almost everywhere. The productivity requirements have just been increased so much because of shifting and because of the way labs - just the way they're operating is different than it was a year ago, and it just speaks to our sweet spot. We're all about productivity. So we're getting that lift to that in instruments, as well as reagents. Biopharma is no different academia. Their productivity is improving because they're shifting, and they're having - doing things different. And they have money. So where they were sharing instruments before, they're buying experts now so maybe other labs can have it or different shifts or whatever, and the reagents are just - the orders have been magnificent. Now we've also really tuned our commercial force to much more inside sales and much more remote access to customers, no travel time so no loss there. So that's probably an improvement. And overall, we're seeing the benefit. I'm just really happy because even with - you would expect a mix issue because of a lower protein amount and stuff this quarter because of academia, we're still seeing everything just being wonderful overall net-net because of the average growth across every segment. And this is still how much is this, how much is that? And we really do think we've seen a corner crossed. Unless there is another whole wave of complete lockdowns, but as you've already known and in Europe, lockdowns are different this time around. They're not shutting schools. They're not shutting institutions. They can't take the hit to their GDP like they did the first time. And if should that happen here in the US, I think it'd be similar. So as long as schools don't shut down and academia continues to progress back, we'll be fine. And biopharma is just rocking and rolling right now, it's all I can say, so. Puneet Souda : That's great. And then on the cell and gene therapy and protein production facility. I think the big question here on investors' mind is the ramp and the cadence that you expect from the revenue from this facility. Maybe could you give us a sense of where you stand right now in terms of the backlog, the overall order book and what's your expectation in terms of the sort of the ramp as we go into 2021 because, obviously, this is a major expansion for Bio-Techne in proteins, and it's well recognized that you are the leaders when it comes to proteins? Chuck Kummeth : Well, we're not the only game in town, a lot of people chasing us, right? And we're a little bit late to the game in terms of GMP, as you know. So we've been very, I'd say, taking this soon as we can. That said, we've got to be careful because our competitors are also building sites. They're also going after this, and they're reading what we're putting out there. And they're reacting to it. So we're going to start backing off on a lot of details at this point going forward. I will tell you that we are on schedule, our factory. That number is out there to the capacity. That capacity number really is anywhere from 140 to over 200. It all depends on the mix of the products we make. And we don't know what the mix will be until we start really getting in the big contracts and they start ramping. We have signed one big deal and that was before this quarter, and we're close to signing many more. And we're in the final stretch of negotiating with many, and these are all multi, multimillion-dollar contract needs. These are the guys that came to us early, said that if you guys get serious on this, with your background, your quality, your bioactivity, your reputation, we're all over it. We're buying from you. So we're doing that, but as we've always said, it's a bit of digit growth in GMP proteins even now, and we'll be migrating some of that production to the new facility as we ramp and build the new production into it as these contracts come. But they're finalizing their Phase III clinicals. I mean it's not going to happen overnight. So we got to qualify, and then we've got to build lots, and we'll be building inventory for them ahead of their purchases. So all that's going to take a year or two. So you can guess as much as we can. I think we'll be kind of doubling every year as we grow this site and maybe more so three or four years out. But the first year or two are going to be - it's really a setup. And we got a lot of customers, we're migrating a lot of business. We're going to have more than half a dozen large customers and possibly many, many more than that, and it's really unknown. You've got the data as well as I do on the number of clinicals going out there. It's exploding, right? So the need is great. I think it's - I really think it is almost going to be an everybody-wins environment for five years in this space. And we want our share. And our share is a majority share because we're the world leader in proteins, so. Puneet Souda : Got it. That's great. Thanks to you. Congrats again. Operator : The next question is from Dan Arias of Stifel. Please go ahead. Dan Arias : Turning on Simple Western a little bit and talk about the outlook that you have for instrument placements at this point there, particularly if we try to separate out pharma where it sounds like it's pretty rocky rolling, to use your words, versus academia. And then along those lines, is it fair to say that going forward, or for this year anyways, growth should be over 20% this year, just given that you were above that level in several quarters pre-COVID and obviously, against the fiscal '20 comp, you have a pretty favorable year-over-year there? Chuck Kummeth : Yes. To put some context, let's back up a year. I mean, two years ago, we started and then academia was shut down, so nothing. So we had a pretty bad quarter, couple of quarters ago with Simple Western and everyone understood why, especially academia being shut down. This is a platform heavily used in academia. And now - so now what's happened. Now with growth well north of 30% as things exploding back out of the blocks. And academia is not at all even back yet. So how can it be that good? So I think it comes from two things. We dug in hard on this because we need to understand because we knew you were going to ask. And the productivity changes, the process changes in biopharma and labs in general, it's changed. There is more of a focus on productivity because of shifting, because of cutbacks and staff. And so more supervisors are having to go back to the bench and help out. And because of that awareness of the platform being a great productivity tool, it's accelerated because more and more decision-makers are really at the bench and driving that productivity. And with extra shifting and then the distance requirements, it's just - it's requiring more machines. More stuff everywhere. I think it's driving us, not only us, but everybody is showing good numbers. I don't think anyone's had as good organic numbers as we have when you subtract the COVID, but there's a portion of this for everybody. And then that's what we see. Now as academia improves, we're going to do even better. So we're north of 30% this - well north, mid-30s this quarter. Can we say we'll be on 20% going forward where we were before, pre-COVID? I think that's a pretty safe bet. I think I'd like to see north of 20%, but 20% should be in the cards. Remember, we're still only at max 50% share with this platform. It is the only automated Western Blot solution in the world. It's highly protected by IP. There doesn't seem to be any other decent cheap way to do this in an automated fashion, and we want to get 40%, 50%. If we get that, it's hundreds of millions of dollars of growth. So Western Blot is one of the singular most done processes in any biochemistry lab, and we're the only tool. So it's going to continue to grow. It works great. The word-of-mouth is there now. I mean it's - the demos, I mean, we suspect there might be a question on how are you guys doing demos when you can't go visit. We've gotten really creative how we ship the instruments in because they're not very big, they're not complicated. You unbox them, plug them in, run the setup and we can do demos remotely with webcasts and webinars, and it's working great. So yes, to answer your question, just short in the end, we do see continued strong growth from here on, with simple listing. No doubt about it. Dan Arias : Yes. Okay. I can feel your enthusiasm there. Okay. And then maybe just on ExoDX, it sounds like you're getting on the right foot there with the EPI test. So I guess with that in mind, are you able to sort of put some numbers on volume growth that you expect this year, this fiscal year, that's obviously been something that's tough to track for lots of different reasons. So just some guidance on volumes would help. And then what should we think about in terms of being able to switch over to accrual accounting on the test that you do perform during the quarter? Thanks much. Chuck Kummeth : Yes. So it's probably early to start giving a lot of detail on that. We do have competition here as well that we're wary of. But we do - we have surpassed most of them in test counts. We're at a 2,400 urologists level of purchases, and that's out of 20,000 or so. So we're still on the early side of this. We do have a 91% re-buy rate, but all with the purchasing urologists, which is incredible. So it's ramping even harder, all right? So the at-home is working. So we are seeing numbers going up, and then we did go to accrual on a portion of our business. I'm going to let Jim comment further on the cash to accrual process. Jim Hippel : Yes. So actually, we have enough history now with our Medicare payments that we were able to move to an accrual-based accounting revenue recognition process for our Medicare-based payments in Q1. So going forward, that will remain on an accrual basis. All of our non-Medicare payments are still on a cash basis and will be for the foreseeable future. Chuck Kummeth : So we've also focused a lot on the direct marketing campaigns and to support the at-home. We're the only one that can do an at-home because we're non-invasive. And it's growing well. You stack on top of that, the promotion with Cal Ripken Jr. and the response is amazing. Just to give you some facts here, we had over - we had almost eight million impressions on Google Ads and Facebook in the previous quarter due to the launch. We've done 90,000 video views. We've had over 100 commercial, radio commercials on the platform with - via the campaign with Cal Ripken. We've had - he's had almost a dozen interviews personally. So he's ramped up and going forward. This guy thinks we saved his life. So he's pretty bullish, and he's pretty supportive and it's been pretty amazing. We've all got signed baseball, by the way. So I don't think we've crossed the corner yet on critical mass. I think we hear away. I've had a lot of friends in diagnostics up in the industry and who told me it takes five years, Chuck, and there's just no cutting any corners and you guys aren't going to get it done in two years, and they're right. It's not going to be done here in two years, and we're cross from a two year point here soon. But it won't take five. We're ahead of schedule in some areas. We're in a strong position for reconsideration, which really hasn't hurt us anyway because of the TRF process with our docs anyway. So we're getting a really, really good Medicare reimbursement rate, even regardless with the multiuse consideration for the - all for the expansion that we hope to get here with our MAC here soon, that will even improve. But we have next-generation stuff coming. We've got - we're kind of halfway there or maybe a year out on the kidney rejection platform. And that market's double the size of the prostate cancer market. So it's even more exciting. So as I said before, this is a platform, not a one-trick pony, and we've got four or five things pipelined over the next five to 10 years that are going to create explosive growth for this new young division, so. Dan Arias : Okay. I'm still in Myspace, guys. So I'm going to take your word for it on the Facebook promotion, but appreciate the colors, Chuck. [Technical Difficulty] Thanks for the question. Chuck, did I hear you right that COVID-related research products contributed three points in the quarter. I believe you're expecting slightly higher than the five that you saw last quarter. So curious what the puts and takes there were? And is there an additional clinical-related tailwind? And how do you expect those to trend in the fiscal second quarter? Chuck Kummeth : Yes. It's a great, great question. We probably have over a couple of dozen of different product tools out there for research related to COVID-19, and they're all ramping nicely. The RNA scope tool is just phenomenal. It will be the biggest seller we have in the portfolio for the division, but it's not like a PCR test or serology test, right? Those are things that can really scale and we all know it's happened in a world with companies who have PCR, right? We have some of that as well with our lab doing EPI test. It's the same equipment. So we're set up. We have an EUA, and we are growing that business as well, but it's just starting to ramp now. The serology, we just got the CE mark a couple of weeks ago. And we're closing deals, and we're starting to launch, and we're ramping. I was obviously hoping to have more serology this past quarter. And we're hoping to have an EUA in the US, and we just haven't been able to secure that EUA yet. The FDA is just - and the only way to describe it is just in turmoil. They're just behind, behind, behind, and they're really struggling. We have been promised that they're all over us. We have submitted everything we can submit, and we're just waiting for the answer, and we expect we'll get it, but that's probably the biggest reason we didn't have more COVID-19 revenue this quarter because we haven't been able to get things started here in the US because we haven't done our EUA yet. So going forward, there will be more. It won't be PCR-related revenues, but we are at a capacity level because this is just ELISA. The whole world has ELISA automation. We can produce very easily 10 million tests a month, and we hope it grows. We do think that we're still early enough as we think the big need is going to be this bow wave of when the vaccines hit, everybody is going to want to know are they immune, can they see their kids again? Can they see their grandkids again, there's going to be a lot of interest. There's going to be a lot of immune response differences with these vaccines. This is not like getting a flu shot and getting maybe a headache, you can get a pretty big response. And so people are going to be wanting to know where they're at. And I don't know if it will last 10 years, it's going to be a while, and there will be a big need for serology. And we'll have the only fully quantitative test out there. There is only one out there that's semi quantitative and that's a Siemens test. And we were given full quantitative neutralization claims with the CE mark in Europe. We're the only one in the world. So we'll see this best-in-class world test to the American public as well here with an EUA, but we're waiting on the FDA to do that for us. And that's the primary reason. Everything else grew kind of okay for the quarter, and it was 3%, yes, of the 10%. I should point out, too, though, we're able to really differentiate what is COVID and what isn't because these are our tests that are really devoted to COVID. A lot of companies out there, it's kind of hard to know how many more beakers, flasks, whatever you're buying that are still already being used for COVID that aren't being put in the COVID numbers, they're putting in their core. So it's kind of hard to know what's apples-to-apples. So we really think that our 10% organic growth really is kind of organic and - compared to a lot of companies out there. But if you're going to separate by SKU where the SKU has something that says COVID-19 on it, it's 3%. And that would be a good question to give all our peers out there as well because I don't think you get the same kind of answers. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Great. That was very helpful. And then great to hear academic return to growth. Can you just give some commentary on how that trended throughout the quarter and where activity levels stood in October? Chuck Kummeth : Slow and steady, very slow. I mean, almost a drip all the way through the quarter, and it just keeps getting better and better. And we've been terrified the last two weeks here with Europe. It might turn around, but so far, our data suggests and our interaction suggests that it's not going to have an impact on labs in schools in Europe even with lockdown. So we'll see. US has just been a slow steady return and we're not there yet, but it's been amazing to see the revenue and the lift we're getting because our growth is surpassing the actual level of their comeback with science. So we've got to know why. Why are we doing better than the roughly 60% that are really opened partially. It's because of these productivity changes and the shifting changes, the duplicity needs, the - all these things are having an impact on our growth. And there's been probably a little bit of restocking, turning things on kind of like what we saw China when China turned down with a surge, they had to re-buy everything and get things going. The difference in China was 100% day one. And here, it's going to be a slow turn on, but there's still a restocking resurgence piece. So a bit of a wave as things come back online, I think. And we're a tool supplier, and we supply reagents, we supply supplies, consumables. So these are things that you're going to see the initial first wave of new revenue with. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Patrick Donnelly from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Patrick Donnelly : Thanks, guys. Chuck, maybe just a follow-up on the serology commentary there was helpful. Can you just kind of detail the path forward here? I know you've obviously talked a little bit about CMS paying more for your test. Where we stand on that front in terms of pricing? And then what's built-in in terms of the double-digit organic growth, Jim talked about? How much we expect serology is going to contribute once we think it's rolling, both Europe and US? Chuck Kummeth : We have zero in those comments. So it's all gravy, it's all coming upside. So whatever we get in serology, you can tack on top of what we've talked - what we've given for any guidance. So our cores is just smoking. So I can tell you. So it will just - serology is just going to be on top of all that. So what's happening? Well, we can't get CMS to give us a new price until we have an EUA. And we can get the channel to open up and close deals for us in the US until we have a EUA too and know what the claims are. We know enough to know that what we sell ELISA kits in general, and we're not trying to gouging anyone. We haven't done anything different. So we know we're going to be in the $5 to $10 a test range. But whether the channel is going to get $80 or $120 reimbursement, it's all unknown. It will be way above the $10. We know there'll be strong interest to sell our kits once things are going because it's such a good test, but it's a double antigen test, right? It's a two step test. So it's going to need to go beyond the $42 of the current reimbursement level out there. So - and even there, you've seen that with the pricing that's happening on these tests, even PCR is going well beyond what the reimbursement levels are. The demand is staggering, right? So I would not underestimate the big guys in the channel they drive these tests and trying to getting over $100 of test these later. Well, there's plenty of proof out there right now that, that will carry probably because the current PCR testing is at that level or beyond. So - but it won't be us getting it, but we're going to get our fair share, and it's going to be great. So we know how to make ELISA kits. We've been doing it for 35 years. Patrick Donnelly : Yes. And then on the antibody side, I know you've talked about in the past, some potential for it to be used, to your point there on the vaccine. Have you had any conversations with kind of the vaccine makers about test being used as part of the vaccine development to see that? Chuck Kummeth : Yes, we talk to all of them. And the last thing a vaccine maker can do when they're on a Phase III clinical is change their control. So it's really kind of odd because you got the - we're waiting on the FDA for EUA for this test. And yet, you can tell them, well, what are you doing? How are you treating the vaccine makers with their - they have to have a test, they have to be based - the vaccine have to be based on something. Because they're doing all their - they're all doing their own home brew because nothing existed early enough for them to go buy anything. And they can't change until things get out there. We do expect a lot of interest in our test by the big vaccine makers as they get things launched and as we go into the second, third, fourth generation of these vaccines. For one, we're doing it in a scalable fashion with the monoclonal. They are not. They're doing home, but they're not intending to scale. They do not intend to sell tests, so they can use a Poly. You can't do this test for the world on a Poly. There aren't enough of those. So we're doing it in a scalable fashion with highly proprietary processes and antibodies that we have discovered that make us the best in the world, working with our partner, Mount Sinai and Cantera [ph] ], which obviously, you need a lot of patient samples to get this done. That's a big problem, by the way, for anyone moving this area. If you don't have thousands of patient samples to do the work with, you really can't get anywhere. And it's a very big issue. So we're the perfect partnership, and that it's gone very well. We've been ready for two months. We just got to get this through our regulatory processes here, and they're bogged down. They're just -- they're bogged down, and they've got tarnished around serologies because the initial EUAs they gave didn't work. And they're out there as single step qualitative tests that simply don't work in some cases. And so we've got across that hurdle, but we can promise you, ours work and they all know it. And they've been very engaged with us and interactive, weekly, the team at the FDA. And we've been talking to higher levels of management in the FDA, and they've assured us that this is a high priority, and they understand. And they understand the significance of world-renowned authorities like Dr. Kramer [ph] at Mount Sinai. So it's coming. But they're not really good at telling you when, right? So we just hope it's coming soon. We do have a CE mark. We're there in Europe, and we're launching and we're going after it. So we'll - first data we'll see on how it will affect revenues and volumes and real demand will be out of Europe first. We have deals signed up for Germany and UK completely at this point, and we're working with Spain, Portugal, Italy at this very moment, and the channels are being set. Jim Hippel : I'll just add to, it's probably fair to say that in terms of end-user demand, that likely will not occur until there actually are vaccines prudent in the market. Chuck Kummeth : I think there's time. I think our initial thinking of people wanting to know, did they - were they sick before and are they okay? I just don't think there's that big of a need. It will be the big though, when vaccines come out. When the vaccine makers are all very supportive of our work, and they wish they could - a lot of them wish they could use and change but they really can't without taking a redo on their clinicals, and there's no way they're doing that. So they have to move forward what they have for now until they launch. Patrick Donnelly : Okay. That makes a lot of sense. And maybe just staying on Europe real quick. Just on the funding backdrop. There's obviously been some lockdown measures there. It seems like COVID overhangs persisting a bit longer than expected. Maybe just your latest thoughts on that region, usually have a pretty good handle on the Europe funding side and what you're kind of baking in as you go forward? Chuck Kummeth : Yes. As you know, we were having some softness in Europe before COVID. And so we are kind of redesigning our commercial organization and our go-to-market strategies. And we had just kind of put that in place as COVID hit. So we weren't able to really measure how it's working. It's kind of starting to work. So our numbers are pretty good in Europe, and it's - and even that's in light of COVID softness. So we have changed a lot of management. We've changed out a lot of people. We've done a lot more inside sales to coincide with the new way to go-to-market and in Europe, you can't visit, so you've got to have a lot more inside sales, and that takes technical people, and we have a lot of them. So it's working pretty well. I think we see funding stable, and I don't think any different here - I don't think there's any change to the status quo of the future for funding for life sciences. I think the needs will be big. I think people are angry. I think people want more assurance that there's safety out there for the next pandemic, and there's just going to be a lot of research dollars and probably more than ever in infectious diseases again. So we'll be playing harder there than we have in the past. Patrick Donnelly : Okay, great. Thanks, Chuck. Operator : The next question is from Alex Nowak of Craig-Hallum Capital. Please go ahead. Alex Nowak : Great. Good morning, everyone. Chuck, how do you intend to take the transplant test forward into the market? And then just a follow-up question to that, what sort of work has Exosome Diagnostics done on early cancer screening because Exosome might be a unique way to do something similar to or better to what GRAIL exactly and others have done with cell free DNA. So just any thoughts there would be helpful? Chuck Kummeth : Yes. We have some work going on in all of those fronts. We're focused - clearly, the most focus is on ramping our prostate test. In parallel, we have the dilution capability, the investment capability to keep working on kidney rejection next. And we're probably halfway there. We're probably a year away from being at where we were a year ago with EPI, all right? So we'll get - we are going to have our first peer-reviewed paper being worked on right now, being - it's accepted, it's out there, working on the second. We'll try to get into guidelines. We'll get an LDT going and then we'll start going - we're working with our MAC on getting on for Medicare lately, probably in a year or so. The market is double, the size, the need is huge. I think - I don't think that it will be as hard getting acceptance and getting a ramp on this test because there's just such a big need. It is so bad. I didn't realize this, but half of all kidney transplants fail in 10 years. And in the first year, a big percentage fail, and they have to start testing immediately for rejection, and they do this via biopsy. They start cutting chunks out of you, it's just not good. So one competitor does it with a blood test, and it's a real competitor really works, their numbers are pretty good. We're going to be able to do with tea in a cup. And it's going to work even better. And so we're on our way. There's a lot of excitement around it. Primary care, oncologists as well as urologists are excited, and we'll be there. Now the companion diagnostics side, the cancer screening initiatives, we have over a dozen initiatives we're working with, and some are starting to scale. And there are some that are close to being becoming a companion diagnostic with a therapeutic. So we're getting there. These are longer fuse initiatives. We have the ability of doing as much as 170 gene screen. It's no 500 like GRAIL, but it's 170. We're ready to go now. If somebody wants to take it through clinicals. We validated it. We have, as you pointed out, the platform of Exosomes is - has a high utility. Amazing results around using Exosomes for neuro disease and in the areas of dealing with what's going on in the brain in brain cancer. Getting through that blood-brain barrier is a big problem and Exosome solves it. So there's a lot of work with us right now on that. So the future is bright for oncology and blood-based oncology-related test for Exosome, but not here today, and we just don't have the resources to fund and do all these in parallel. So we're kind of staggering them and doing partnerships and talking to more companies, but the interest is growing and the platform is real. Exosomes are here to stay, so. Alex Nowak : So very interesting, very helpful. And then in the press release and the prepared remarks, you called out these long-term budget increases across - potentially across the world due to the pandemic. Can you just give any specifics what you're hearing from other countries such as China and the emerging ones like such as India. What are you hearing as far as their budgets going up as a result of the pandemic? Chuck Kummeth : Well, all I can comment on is what - as we put all these questions with our sales force and our relationships in the field with our customers, and this is what they're telling us. I'm not on the speed dial to any country leader, but this is what we know so far. And in places like China. China is going to be weird this year because it's a fifth year of their 5 year plan. So there's going to be - it's not going to be the 25% to 30% automatic, but I think 20% is in the cards and then come next year, I think will come out of the gate super strong because I think funding for life sciences is healthier, is going to be off the charts there this time around. US, I don't think it's going to matter who's President. I think it's a bipartisan agreement area. And I just think there's a lot of the population, would like to see a lot more than the $40 billion spent, which is a rounding year compared to what COVID has cost us, so - in NIH funding. So I think it's going to be a big future. Europe is going to be obviously country by country, but again, places like the UK, it's going to go up. It's got to. And so that trickles down to us because we sell broad-based tools across all life sciences research, and we've always talked about this in the past, every 8% to 10% increase in budget, we usually see about a 1% lift in total organic growth. And that's kind of what's been in the past. And if we see a 20% increase, let's say, next year in funding, you should see a good 2% lift from that alone just in our core. And then not on top of everything else we're doing. So I think the future is right. I think the tailwind is - it's a tailwind currently not a headwind looking forward, at least for next couple of years. Alex Nowak : Yes. Understood. Thank you. I appreciate it. Operator : The next question is from Dan Leonard from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Dan Leonard : Thank you. So Chuck, Jim, you mentioned in your remarks that you thought there was some signal of restocking in the quarter. How meaningful do you think that was? Chuck Kummeth : I think when you do that, you have to do it by account. So we've done really big analysis in the order sizes. If you've got an average order size of $1,000 per university and all of a sudden in the quarter, it's $1,200. You start asking why, right? And some of that's restocking. Is it significant? Is it something like or without that, we would have been 4% or 5% versus over 10%? No way. I mean, it's marginal, I think, but there is some restocking. Dan Leonard : Okay\u2026 Chuck Kummeth : Our consumers - for a very long period of time. So you're not going to have a big volume of restocking, generally use our reagents within days of purchase, run rate more mostly, so. Dan Leonard : Okay. And then on the outlook, your comp gets a lot easier in the December quarter. Is it fair to assume that your growth rate could accelerate pretty meaningfully in Q2 absent reestablishment of lockdown just given the easier comp and the momentum in the business? Chuck Kummeth : Yes. One, I just want to reiterate, we're just ecstatic of this quarter. This is the quarter we were afraid of, it's a 13% comp, and we just kind of blew it away. This quarter coming up was not a great quarter for us last year. And so it should go well. I can just tell you, the start of the quarter is really good. But December might be really weird. And a lot of universities are going to shut down from thanksgiving all the way into January. So you don't have multiple coming and going, right, for the students. So we don't expect a strong December, but we've had a great start to the quarter, so we'll see how it ends up, but I don't think December is going to be off the chart for anybody, to be honest. But that said, every country is different. And we're seeing good strength in China. We're seeing really good everywhere, everywhere but India. India is pretty much a disaster right now, but not very big for us yet. And going into next year, our Q3 and Q4, obviously, the comps get super easy. So Q4, for sure. And so we're - as we talked about a double-digit year, we see a double-digit year in the cards here for us, so. Dan Leonard : Okay. Thank you. Chuck Kummeth : The points we put in the Board this quarter were the most - the biggest thing we needed to do and I think we did it, so. Operator : The next question is from Jacob Johnson from Stephens, Inc. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, guys, this is Mason on for Jacob. Just a couple of quick ones from me. First, could you update us on Quad Technologies and B-MoGen? And then outside of those and GMP proteins, are there any cell and gene therapy capabilities that would - that interest you guys, whether you're adding them organically or via M&A? Chuck Kummeth : Yes. We're still hunting that space. I'd like to buy 10 little companies in this space, if I could find them all and get them, but they come at high prices. We have most of the workflow kind of closed. So we don't need a lot, but we would certainly add-on for scale. We've launched our Quad technologies, and it's being sold. It's being used. It's -- we're fairly in preclinicals, and I think we're close to being in real life clinicals, and we've just closed some deals recently here with - and some real strong interest around the B-MoGen. This is a little longer-range idea, right, to walk - to go away from viral vectors and go non-viral vector for gene editing. That's a big change after 20 years of viral vectors out there. So we are seeing amazing response and supportiveness for this technology, and we are pretty much on plan with the revenue. It's ramping. These deals are getting larger. The team is in great shape. We have a complete team from the acquisition, including its leader, who's still working for us on this. And the future is bright here. As part of the JV, with strong leadership from guys like John Wilson and Wilson Wolf, who pretty much is the bioreactor standard of records, inspecting everywhere out there, and we're leveraging him to be looking at our proteins even on viral vector approaches. We're trying to - we've got a technology we call Pro Dots that you can actually manufacture and ship within the bag, the single-use bioreactors or the GRx, and you don't have to mess around with any sterility risk issues as you reconcentrate shipping protein unreconstituted is a way to go. So we'll be the world leader in that, and we'll have the best lot-to-lot consistency. And every time you lotalize [ph] you lose - you typically can lose some bioactivity, and we've cracked the recipe for how to do this right, and we have a lot of trade secret around it. So it's growing. It's ramping. It kind of goes back to my earlier decision. It kind of goes in line with the ramp of the GMP proteins in the factory. It's J-curve over the next five years, and we stand behind our - we think it will be a $250 million, $300 million business unit, five years out, probably less than five years at this point and it's ramping nicely. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. I'll leave it there. Thanks, guys. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Chuck Kummeth for any closing remarks. Chuck Kummeth : Well, I'll just conclude with thanks for being online. It's been great to talk with you all. We had a wonderful quarter, but the next quarter will be the most important quarter in the company's history, and we're on to that now. So we'll talk to you then. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may disconnect your lines. Thank you for your participating, and have a pleasant day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning and welcome to the Bio-Techne Earnings Conference Call for the Second Quarter of Fiscal Year 2021. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. And the call will be open for questions following management\u2019s prepared remarks. During our Q&A session, please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. I would now like to turn the call over to David Clair, Bio-Techne's Senior Director, Investor Relations and Corporate Development. David Clair : Good morning and thank you for joining us. On the call with me this morning are Chuck Kummeth, Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Hippel, Chief Financial Officer of Bio-Techne. Before we begin, let me briefly cover our Safe Harbor Statement. Some of the comments made during this conference call may be considered forward-looking statements, including beliefs and expectations about the company's future results as well as the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and financial results. The company's 10-K for fiscal year 2020 identifies certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements made during this call. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of any new information or future events or developments. The 10-K as well as the company's other SEC filings are available on the company's website within its Investor Relations section. During the call, non-GAAP financial measures may be used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. Tables reconciling these measures to most comparable GAAP measures are available in the company's press release issued earlier this morning on the Bio-Techne Corporation website at www.bio-techne.com. I will now turn the call over to Chuck. Charles Kummeth : Thanks Dave and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter conference call. Hoping you and your families have remained safe as we get closer to turning the corner on this horrible pandemic. The Bio-Techne team delivered another strong quarter accelerating our organic growth year-over-year to 19% building on the strength we experienced last quarter. In fact our 19% organic growth rate represents our strongest performance since I joined the company in 2013. This growth was broad based across our segments and geographies as our print annotation [ph] in biopharma continue to be red hot. And even academia returned to double-digit growth.  The new normal of social distancing and staggered shifts has become an accelerant for the continued adoption of several of our technologies namely Simple Plex and Simple Western. I will dive into the specifics of each of these platforms later but they are all gaining traction or remain in the early innings of penetrating their large respective markets. We delivered this record organic growth with a continued focus on profitability as our adjusted operating margin improved 530 basis points year-over-year to 38.7%. Some of this improvement reflects the timing of hiring investments to drive future growth but shows a leverage in profitability inherent in our business model.  The COVID pandemic continues impact traditional ways researchers are staffing labs and conducting experiments as well as the ways we are interacting with these customers. But I'm encouraged with the innovative solutions researchers have leveraged to push science further and the innovative strategies our commercial teams have implemented to meet their evolving needs in these challenging times. Academia in particular is getting better at managing through the COVID related restrictions and we're encouraged with the sequential improvement we experienced in this end market. While we experienced robust growth with both biopharma and academia customers in Q2, both of these end markets remain largely closed to outside visitors creating challenges for our commercial team to get in front of customers. Our commercial team once again did an excellent job adjusting to this new normal leveraging webinars to educate current to potential customers on our portfolio of agents, selling gene therapy solutions, tissue biopsy and spatial analysis solutions and instruments.  During the quarter our team got even more creative using virtual coffees and happy hours to get increased face time with our customers. These virtual meetings and webinars will remain an important cost effective part of our commercial strategy for the remainder of the pandemic and beyond. Our digital marketing initiatives remain an important tool to differentiate Bio-Techne, educate the scientific community on our portfolio of innovative and productivity enabling tools, drive traffic to our website, and ultimately convert this traffic to revenue. These digital efforts have become an increasingly more effective tool during the COVID pandemic, and we continue to execute this strategy at a high level in Q2. Researchers often begin their quest for reagents and research productivity tools with an internet search so ensuring Bio-Techne is one of the top results of these searches is critical to drive traffic to our website, convert these visits to sales of our products. Leveraging search engine optimization and targeted ad strategies remain a key component of our digital strategy and both continue to generate high returns on investment with an outsized impact on sales within our antibody and protein portfolio.  Last quarter we announced the launch of OneWeb, a new website that unites all of Bio-Techne\u2019s brands under one easy to navigate site, enabling our customers to order products across our instrument and reagent portfolio under one website while leveraging algorithms to drive purchases across our portfolio and position the business to realize increased revenue synergies. We began a scaled launch of OneWeb in November, and initial customer feedback, as well as traffic to our web have been positive. OneWeb paired with our SEO and targeted ad efforts drove double-digit growth this quarter in a number of sessions, page views, new users, and repeat users on our website. Given the correlation of our revenue growth this quarter, our strategy is clearly generating results and we will continue to pull this growth lever going forward.  Now let's discuss the performance of our growth platform, starting with Protein Sciences segment, which grew 19% organically for the quarter. Growth is strong across our core reagent portfolio, with both RUO [ph] proteins and antibodies growing low double-digits. In addition to the impact of academic labs reopening in our digital initiatives, our reagent business also experienced a favorable tailwind from custom work for biopharma customers in need of additional protein or antibody capacity. Our custom reagent development business increased over 60% in the quarter and we are leveraging multiple strategies to capitalize on this outsourcing trend going forward. During Q2 we continue to push our cell and gene therapy initiatives forward. One of the key components within our cell and gene therapy business is GMP proteins with these cytokines and growth factors playing a critical role in the cell and gene therapy workflow. Revenue generated from our portfolio of GMP proteins once again increased nearly 100% in Q2. Recall that we recently opened a 61,000 square foot state of the art GMP reagent manufacturing facility to address the expected demand for GMP proteins and reagents as a growing pipeline of cell and gene therapeutics progress through the regulatory approval process. We made significant progress qualifying the facility and have begun manufacturing production lots of select GMP proteins. We also executed our second long-term GMP protein supply agreement in the quarter. We remain in various stages of discussion with several other biotech companies of pipeline cell and gene therapies for future potential long-term GMP protein supply agreements and are very pleased with the funnel of potential deals.  Sticking with cell and gene therapy, our genome engineering services business, which includes our non-viral vector based gene transfer technology TCBuster continue to gain attention from the cell and gene therapy industry. I would also note we're seeing a growing list of collaborators and positive feedback on Cloudz, our non-magnetic deep base cell separation technology for a human T-Cell, natural killer cells, and human regulatory T-Cell T-Reg activation and expansion kits. We are still in the early innings of both TCBuster and Cloudz but both of these innovative cell and gene therapy workflow of technologies remain important pieces of our cell and gene therapy workflow solutions. ScaleReady, our JV with Fresenius Kabi and Wilson Wolf formally launched at the beginning of calendar 2021 with a mission of providing a more simple, scalable and versatile cell and gene therapy manufacturing platform in the industry. As a reminder, this consortium pairs Bio-Techne\u2019s portfolio of cell and gene therapy workflow solutions including our Cloudz cell separation and activation technology, GMP proteins, and genome engineering services with Fresenius Kabi\u2019s leukapheresis instrument and Wilson Wolf\u2019s bioreactor to enable a modular cost efficient workflow solution. The ScaleReady website is up and running, and the commercial team began its initial customer outreach campaign including initial contact with over 600 industry participants and almost 250 gene therapy companies.  Also during Q2, Bio-Techne made an initial strategic investment in Changzhou Eminence biotechnology company, a China based life science company with best in class media, including CHO cells and other GMP media products. As well as custom cell line and media formulation development services, Eminence will use the financing proceeds to expand its manufacturing capacity and increase the service capabilities of its China headquarter GMP media production facility. Investing in Eminence expands Bio-Techne\u2019s foothold in providing additional products and services to support the needs of the rapidly growing Chinese biopharmaceutical industry and fits extremely well with our existing high growth product portfolio in China. We look forward to working with the Eminence team.  Now let's discuss our proteomic analytical tools portion of the protein sciences segment where the strong momentum we saw in Q1 continued with our portfolio of instruments and assays enabling research labs to increase productivity while adhering to social distancing and staggered work shift protocols. Once again, we experience very strong growth in our SimpleFlex multiplexing ELISA instrument ELLA, our revenue almost doubled year-over-year. Encouragingly, SimpleFlex utilization within our customer base continue to -- by as researchers leveraged ELLA to investigate inflammation, cancer, neuroscience and other disease states and biological pathways. ELLA\u2019S relatively small footprint, low price point, sub-picogram level of sensitivity and reproducibility is driving both instrument placements and consumable pull through. Our clinical program with Micropoint in China is on track, which speaks to the incredible diversity Ella is capable of. We are now taking ELLA through a 510k process in the U.S., which will unlock new clinical opportunities for this amazing platform.  It was a similar story with our automated Western instrument portfolio, where we grew almost 30% in the quarter. Our [indiscernible] automated Western platforms turn the labor intensive, messy, inconsistent, cumbersome manual Western Blot process, which can take up to two days into a fully automated, reproducible sample to answer three-hour process. This value proposition has been resonating incredibly well with researchers as they return to the bench. And with our solutions, less than 15% penetrated in the addressable market, there's plenty of room for continued growth. Our biologics instruments which provide protein purity information and are used directly in bioprocessing also had a standout quarter as we experienced broad demand from biopharma, including several companies with COVID-19 vaccines in various stages of development or commercialization, as well as continued interest from companies working on cell and gene therapies.  Now I will provide an update on our diagnostics and genomics portfolio where organic growth revenue also increased 19% in Q2. Let's start with an update on our ACD or tissue pathology franchise, where organic revenue increased in the upper 20% range for the quarter. This growth was broad-based across geographies and product lines, including very strong performances from micro RNAscope following its launch this past summer as well. Momentum we experienced in RNAscope last quarter continued in Q2 as a single cell spatial resolution and high sensitivity provided by this technology continues to drive market adoption. Biopharma\u2019s need for increased productivity while working with limited or staggered shifts remains a tailwind for our PAS or pharma assay services business within ACD. Biopharma outsourcing their spatial genomic analysis has driven 40% growth in this business in the first half of fiscal year 2021.  Now let's discuss our Exosomes Diagnostics business, starting with our prostate cancer liquid biopsy assay, the ExoDx prostate test. Encouragingly, we believe most of the urology practices across the country have reopened and we experienced another sequential increase in our prostate test volume. But patient traffic is still down from last year as older patients are more likely to quarantine at home until they become vaccinated. We expect urology traffic to continue to improve as vaccines make their way into this segment of the population, which in turn should have a positive impact on our ExoDx prostate testing volumes. In the meantime, our home kit version of the test continues to be the safest solution for patients to continue to work with their urologist.  Recall that we partnered with Baseball Hall Famer Cal Ripken Jr to co-promote our ExoDx prostate test following his personal prostate cancer journey, including his use of the ExoDx prostate test, which ultimately influenced his potentially life saving decision to get the biopsy that led to the discovery of his aggressive prostate cancer. The marketing campaign continues to be successfully leveraged across all social media platforms and channels and is driving traffic to the Fight Like Hell page on the ExoDx website, where we saw page visits increase over 1400% sequentially. We also launched a physician locator function on the ExoDx website, enabling patients interested in taking a test to find physicians offering a test in their respective city. Our Exosome Diagnostics platform is not just limited to our ExoDx prostate test. There is a full pipeline of high value diagnostic tests with our Exo True Kidney Transplant Rejection assay next in line for commercialization. We expect ExpTrue [ph] to become an important tool in the management of kidney transplant patients with it's easy to collect urine based sampling, sample enabling increased adherence to testing protocols. We completed verification of the assay and have optimized the workflow. Initial ExoTrue data has been accepted for publication in a well-respected medical journal, and we anticipate publication in the coming weeks.  Despite generally soft non-COVID related diagnostic testing volumes our Diagnostic Reagents division once again delivered a solid quarter, with organic revenue increasing in the upper single-digits. This is actually the sixth quarter in a row that our Diagnostic Reagents division has delivered positive growth as a development pipeline and to a lesser extent COVID related opportunities continue to bear fruit and smooth out the impact of what can sometimes be a lumpy bulk reagents order.  I'd like to now give an update on our COVID-19 initiative. The products we sell are directly related to COVID research, for example, reagents and instruments with specific viral research applications, ACD probes to detect the virus in tissue and sales of bulk diagnostic reagents using COVID testing applications was an estimated 3% tailwind to our business in Q2. We expect that research in COVID will be around for many years, thus making this tailwind a sustaining new layer of our product portfolio going forward. We continue to make progress with the commercialization of the COVID-19 serology assay that we co-developed with Kantaro Biosciences based on Mount Sinai\u2019s technology.  The Kantaro serology assay is a truly differentiated test, providing not only information on the presence of COVID-19 antibodies, but also the level of titer of those antibodies. In November the Kantaro COVID-Seroklir assay received EUA approval as a semi-quantitative assay and we have submitted additional data to the FDA supporting a full-quantitative claim as we receive in Europe with a CE Mark. We have commercial agreements now set up in many countries and are in discussions with many U.S. Spacelab systems. Today most of the demand for COVID-19 testing has been PCR based, geared towards answering the question am I infected with COVID-19. Now that vaccines are becoming available with a lot of virus continues to mutate, we believe demand for serology testing will increase as patients look to answer the question, am I immune? Ultimately, following a full FDA quantitative claim, we believe the Kantaro assay will be able to answer this important question, allowing us to return to the pre-COVID lifestyle we are all looking forward to.  Our Q2 is evidence of the growth we are starting to unlock with our portfolio of proteomic analytical instruments, tissue pathology in spatial genomics products, cell and gene therapy workflow solutions, and liquid biopsy diagnostics. These large high growth end markets remain under penetrated and we're in the early innings of realizing the full potential of these growth technologies and platforms. Later on for these the content and cross divisional synergies inherent in our core reagent portfolio and I'm increasingly confident in our ability to deliver our long-term revenue and profitability targets. I'm extremely proud of the execution that the Bio-Techne team delivered during the first half of our fiscal 2021, and we're looking forward to building on its success in the second half of 2021 and beyond. With that, I'll turn it over to Jim. Jim Hippel : Thanks, Chuck. I will provide an overview of our Q2 fiscal 2021 financial performance for the total company, provide some additional color on the performance of each of our segments, and give some thoughts on the remainder of our fiscal 2021. Starting with the overall second quarter financial performance adjusted EPS was $1.62 versus $1.08 one year ago, an increase of 50% over last year representing a new company record. Foreign exchange positively impacted EPS by $0.08. GAAP EPS for the quarter was a $1.15 compared to $3.02 in the prior year, representing a 62% decrease. Our GAAP EPS results in the second quarter of last year benefited from a favorable realized and unrealized gain on our investment in ChemoCentryx. Q2 revenue was 224.3 million, an increase of 21% year-over-year on a reported basis and 19% on an organic basis for exchange. Foreign exchange translation had a favorable 2% impact on our revenue. Our strong growth in Q2 was fairly consistent across the globe, ranging from the high teens in the U.S. to 25% organic growth in China. By end market biopharma growth was very strong at over 20% and it was nice to see Academia continue to improve grow in the low teens during the second quarter. Moving on to the details of the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin was 71.5% in the quarter compared to 70.6% in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by favorable volume leverage. Adjusted SG&A in Q2 was 25.2% of revenue, a 310 basis point decrease compared to the prior year and R&D expense in Q2 was 7.5% of revenue, 140 basis points lower than the prior year. While our adjusted SG&A and R&D spend both increased sequentially and compared to the prior year, a tight labor market in the life science space did not allow us to feel all headcount additions to the team at the pace we'd originally anticipated. Given the continued improvement we are seeing in our end markets, we still plan to fill these positions and continue with investments to position the company for growth going forward. The resulting adjusted operating margin for Q2 was 38.7%, an increase of 530 basis points from the prior year period and a 50 basis point sequential improvement from Q1. Looking at our numbers below operating income, net interest expense in Q2 was 3.4 million, decreasing 1.1 million compared to the prior year. The decrease was due to a continued reduction of our bank debt during fiscal 2021, as well as lower floating interest rates. Our bank debt on the balance sheet as of the end of Q2 stood at 231.5 million. Other adjusted non-operating expense was 1.3 million for the quarter, compared to 2.5 million expected in the prior year, primarily reflecting the foreign exchange impact related to our cashpoint arrangements. For GAAP reporting, other non-operating income includes unrealized gains from our investments in ChemoCentryx.  Moving further down the P&L, our adjusted effective tax rate in Q2 was 20.6%, 120 basis point improvement over the prior year, with the improvement primarily driven by geographic mix. We expect our effective tax rate going forward to be consistent with Q2 barring no changes in corporate tax law. As Chuck mentioned, during Q2, we made a strategic equity investment in China based Eminence, a company focused on providing media as well as custom cell line development and media formulation services to the Chinese biopharmaceutical market. $130,000 non-controlling interest line item reflects one-month loss from the portion of Eminence which we do not own. The impact to other lines of the P&L as a result of consolidating Eminence was immaterial in Q2.  Turning to cash flow and return of capital, a record 89.3 million of cash was generated from operations in the quarter. In Q2, our net investment in capital expenditures was 11.4 million, primarily driven by the completion of our new GMP protein factory. And during Q2 we returned capital to shareholders with 12.4 million of dividends. We finished the quarter with 40.3 million average shares outstanding. Our balance sheet remains very strong with 283 million in cash and short-term available for sale investments and a total leverage ratio of well under one time EBITDA.  Next, I'll discuss the performance of our reporting segment, starting with the protein sciences segment. Q2 reported sales were 172.2 million, with reported revenue increasing 22%. Organic growth increased 19% with foreign exchange having a favorable impact of 3% on revenue growth. Within a segment, a strong growth was very broad based, with double-digit growth in nearly all reagent assay and instrument platforms. As Chuck described in his remarks, platforms of Noble mentioned include Simple Plex, Simple Western, Biologics, and cell and gene therapy, especially pertaining to GMP proteins. Operating margin for the protein sciences segment was 46.6%, an increase of 360 basis points year-over-year, due primarily to stable volume leverage and cost management.  Turning to diagnostics and genomics segment, Q2 reported sales were 52.5 million, with reported revenue increasing 20%. Organic growth for the segment was 19%, with foreign exchange translation having a favorable 1% impact on revenue. Similar to Q1, our genomics division led this segment in the quarter. We experienced strength across the entire ACD branded portfolio, with micro RNAscope, Bioscope and our diagnostics partnership with Leica being an honorable mention. Also a driver of growth for diagnostics and genomics, Exosome Diagnostics Q2 revenue increased over 100% from last year, with higher collections for Medicare, private payers, and patient cash collection driving the year-over-year increase. As Chuck mentioned, our diagnostic reagents division continued its growth streak by executing on COVID related opportunities to offset the headwind many of its traditional OEM diagnostic customers are facing with patients forgoing routine visits to the doctor.  Moving on to the diagnostics and genomics segment operating margin at 15.5%, this segment\u2019s operating margin improved from 2.2% reported in the prior year. The increase reflects stable volume leverage in our genomics division, less dilution from Exosome Diagnostics, as well as strong cost management. In summary, our fiscal 2021 is off to a great start with 15% organic revenue growth during the first half of the fiscal year, our results thus far have demonstrated that our portfolio of products and solution offerings are more relevant than ever to our customers who are on the front lines of diagnosing and developing cures for disease. We believe that the current pandemic has only strengthen the resolve of our customers to accelerate their great work and we will continue to do everything in our power to provide them the tools to help them succeed. Thus, we see the current momentum of our business continuing in the back half of our fiscal year.  However, to support our customer\u2019s needs beyond the remainder of this fiscal year, we need to catch up on our investments and our product pipelines and post sales service and support while continuing to invest in customer engagement activities, especially those of a digital nature. We start to make progress with these additional investments in Q2, but intend to accelerate back to our plan in the back half of the year. If successful, these investments may slightly lower our operating margin from its level in the first half of the fiscal year but will position us well for our long-term strategic plan of continued double-digit growth for years to come. That concludes my prepared comments. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question is from Puneet Souda with SVB. Puneet, please proceed with your question. Puneet Souda : Great, thanks and Chuck, congrats on the strong quarter, impressive growth here in protein sciences and across the board. First of all, could you provide sort of the contribution that we're seeing from GMP proteins and cell and gene therapy and sort of how should we think about that for the full year here given the momentum that you're seeing so far? Charles Kummeth : Yeah sure, well, we're not going to give too much grill in the way of detail. We've been talking about throwing 100%. We've talked in the past of being a $30 million type portfolio with most of it being serious right now. And we're pretty much a run rate on protein's at 10 million and we gave you the growth rates in there. We have the ability to increase capacity -- to increase -- I guess we make here at the headquarters by a factor of four if we need to. So we're good while we take the time to qualify the new site, which is going along really well.  Again, we've talked in the past about this 10 million in GMP approach growing to maybe 20 million next year and doubling in after that and then hopefully it really starts ramping once we start getting the production side of the therapeutics as they come out the back-end of clinical. The rest of the portfolio, it's kind of hard to say. We had a great quarter for both acceptance, for both Cloudz and for TCBuster we talked about. We're getting an awful lot of new revenue to get a look at these technologies and new preclinical with so we're pretty excited. The team's pretty excited, the best quarter we had for TCBuster. We're actually working on expanding the site already or making it. So it's a bit of a surprise so far. So it's kind of hard for me to tell you what it is going to be next year, but I think probably double what it is this year and probably double again next year after that. And as we've said in our five year outlook here, in our $1.5 billion goal, we see a $300 million business is what we see.  So it'll be consisting of a bunch of components, 150 or so at least in GMP proteins but the rest is sort of between Cloudz, TCBuster, instrumentation, ACD for technologies for spatial cell analysis, Ella testing for QC testing and workflow, all these bits and pieces, roll up to 300. And, we're probably a year away from getting any more real -- doing a real detailed guesses on just what the recipes look like. I think the safest one is a GMP protein base right now. Puneet Souda : Got it, that's very helpful. On Ella, this is a really strong quarter again, I think you've pointed that out in the past couple of quarters too. Obviously that product line is gaining significant traction here. Can you give us a sense of where this business could be? I mean, this is competitive ELISA market after all. So where could it be and what are the other key initiatives that you have in including the 510k approval that you're submitting for? And in that same context, if you could just help us understand, I mean, there's quite a bit of momentum right now in proteomics. Obviously, Bio-Techne is core to proteomics. You are one of the leaders across the board in antibodies, proteins, cytokines and broadly across proteomics. So maybe just help us understand where that could -- where this business could be, the protein sciences business overall and the proteomics business could be overall and sort of longer term and five-year timeframe? Charles Kummeth : Well, it's growing beyond our expectations and clearly we're super well-positioned in proteomics and as the wave of research hits and this golden era keeps growing and in the end, money is siphoned off these stimulus plans for more pandemic relief and pandemic research so it never happens again we're going to be a big beneficiary. We're seeing -- we're really seeing a lift in every part of our business in every geography, it was just astounding. I don't think I've ever seen a more green dashboard so in my career. It's hard to pin down what's COVID and what's just research. Now, we've dug into what's going on with our customers and they're certainly bigger biopharma are investing more, they're taking the cash, the ones -- the vaccine makers are obviously doing more. Companies that are doing well off COVID are taking that cash and doing more R&D. And where there's more R&D and more research, we're benefiting.  I've always said that Simple Flex was a sleeper, right and it had for a few years now. And, if it keeps growing at a near 100%, it's going to be really big really soon. So we've now -- we're now well over 500 instruments placed worldwide, which is a lot. This is an amazing machine and it just does a lot for the money. It is just an amazing piece of technology from an amazing team that has worked on it for many years before we acquired the company. I think that was seen by Micropoint early on in China, and we're on track with their clinical and this could be -- that deal alone could be $100 million of revenue in three or four years if they hit their targets. This is a guy that did Mine Ray so he has a lot of credibility. He is very interested in making a very standardized patient monitoring platform for large hospital systems in China and there's a lot of them. We are taking through the 510k process here in the U.S. so we can try to elicit more interest like Micropoint in China. Micropoint is going to do all the CFDA themselves. They're experts. They're doing -- they've done the panels, they're doing everything. Here, I don't know -- we were probably not be able to do all that ourselves.  We'll do the 510K, we're going to do it off a standard analyzer, something well known, something we can get to the system, and we are talking to potential interested parties. But this thing has got legs and it's got legs in neuroscience, it has got legs in oncology, it's anywhere that proteomic needed to be testing biomarkers this is the machine. As you know, the competition is out there in a multiplex format, starting with Luminex, we're partners with them as well, but we don't have crosstalk with our platform. And now we're increasing the channels. So we're at eight and we maybe could go higher. But at eight, that's kind of sweet part, three point and they have eight channels with no crosstalk with the type of pseudo noise we have with this machine and only one hour sample to answer, it's kind of unheard of.  Of course other is Mesoscale. I think we've got some work to do to crack where Mesoscale really, really hit because they've got a full workflow with software and it really is integrated into the workflow of their customers. And we've probably got more of a standalone box. We've got to get better at that piece of it and we're working on that. And then, of course, there's the whole clinical side. This thing really could be a point of care machine. We're working on a 4x8 cartridge, something that you don't have to queue up a lot of tests in order to run it. And anyway, I just I see a strong, strong future. And you asked what it could become, I think this is $200 million to $300 million our business in five years, to be honest or more. It could be much bigger, it depends on the acceptance and how well we keep diversifying into new applications. But, automated ELISA, multiplexed based proteomics, bio biomarker research it's as you just said, it's all the rage right now. It's accelerating, not leveling out. So we see a strong future in this platform. We're not surprised by the 100% growth, even though this thing is already a big platform. It is big as anything we hoped we had in the original protein Simple segment including Simple Western, now it is getting there. Keep strong, it is going to be the biggest very soon. Puneet Souda : That\u2019s super helpful Chuck, and thanks for all the details. And if I could squeeze last one in for Jim. Jim, I appreciate the investments into Eminence, and obviously the GMP facility which is delivering growth now. And, when you look at on the acquisitions front in organic growth, we just -- we have not seen much on that end lately. Is it largely a function of the valuations in the space or anything else or a certain specific areas that are sort of more challenging versus attractive and just walk us through your assumptions there because obviously that's an important part of what Bio-Techne has done in the past? Jim Hippel : Yeah, what I'd say on the evaluation front is that, the evaluations have been a challenge for many years, if that's really nothing new. It's really the ebbs and flows of the deal flow and what's coming up available and I think for a lot of 2020, probably the pandemic being a good reason why the flow wasn't as strong as it had been in prior years. But in the last several months, we're starting to see that turn around and seen a lot more deal flow, a lot more interesting targets. So, it's hard to predict because there's a lot of stars that need to align but I would predict that we will see more activity by us on that front in the remainder of calendar 2021 we saw last year. Puneet Souda : Okay, great. Okay, thanks guys. Congrats. Charles Kummeth : Thanks Puneet. Operator : And our next question is from Catherine Schulte with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Catherine Schulte : Hey guys, congrats on the strong quarter and thanks for the question. I guess first, just as you think about the outlook for fiscal 2021, last quarter you talked about maybe a 10% to 15% range for the year. So just curious if you had an updated thought on where you should end up in that range or if we should be thinking about a new range, given the strong performance you saw this quarter? Charles Kummeth : Sure, I'm not sure who was noted was this morning talking about clearing 15% plus for the year. We've stayed away from that. We certainly were bullish on ending up double-digit again. We left our comments at continuing momentum and the momentum is 15% to half year. And we have the easiest comp ahead of us for the rest of the fiscal year. So you can do the math from that but yeah, we're pretty bullish continuing at the levels we're at or even better to be honest at this point. Catherine Schulte : Okay. And you've talked about some research labs, perhaps needing to buy a second version of things given social distancing and building out secondary labs. How much of the rebound that you've seen do you think is related to perhaps some of that stocking or build out dynamics? Charles Kummeth : There is a little bit of stocking. After last quarter and in these below results and we don't have much COVID in our numbers yet. COVID is still coming for us hopefully with serology. We did a big deep dive really globally and what the hell's going on and why are we doing so well and so we did it. We really did an account by account customer by customer breakdown, by segment of how we are doing and why. And there's really no silver bullet. We're up with vaccine makers for obvious reasons. We're up with biopharma for a lot of reasons we talked about, but there's been more OEM work as well. They're all having a pretty good year, so they're outsourcing more so we've had more customer given to us. Academia has been certainly the duplicity issue and some surge comeback and maybe some budget flushing on a multiple fronts to be honest, we discovered some I think not material. It's not like it's half our growth or a third or fourth, but there's a little there. And it's really a sum of the parts is what comes down to for us. So, no silver bullet, it's not all COVID, it's not all anything, but it is a rising tide, really that's just research is doing really well on all fronts for us.  We've been -- we're perfectly positioned as Puneet said earlier. I mean, in proteomics, it's just where we are. We're in the right spot right now. And, whether you're buying antibodies to make COVID tests or you need overflow help because, you're stacked with working capacity to develop vaccines or your academic institutions that are staggering. You're building out new labs and you've got to buy more equipment, preferably equipment that has its productivity inclinated like ours, not so expensive. That's kind of where it's all coming from. And in our reagents too it's broad based. Even ELISA, I mean one thing that we can always go back to and just look at our good old ELISA kits, just cute kits, 35 years old and they kind of ebb and flow with projects and kind of health of a project in biopharma with best year in years. So it just kind of speaks to the broad based growth. And we're not the only company talking about it, right. Everyone's riding its wave right now and we just happen to be riding a little higher than most, which is great for us. Catherine Schulte : Okay. And last one for me, just on the Exo kidney transplant test, you talked about publication in the next few weeks, what's the path forward for that test and how should we think about potential launch timing there? Charles Kummeth : Yeah. I really was hoping that we'd be talking about that publication by now. It's -- it really is imminent, it's should be days, not weeks, but who knows? The data looks fantastic. If it had been published, we could talk about the data. It's very good data. It's the first peer reviewed article, we need to get a second, we need to do an outcomes test. There's work to be done before we start going after an LDT approach or working with a Mac or get started, but we're on the path and we think we're at a year or less here of getting into early access selling this thing. Probably a good year away from a crosswalk or anything. But, we'll see -- we're also looking at partnerships as well. And, we're also looking at the other Macs, not using the same one we did prostate. So we got a lot going on here. It's just been going very well. That platform is astounding. It works so well, it's amazing. As you know, Exosome we feel is the best in class for liquid biopsy and the data is going to prove it here when you start seeing some of it. And, there it's a big market. There aren't the same kind of barriers like we have with prostate and urologists. We have organ centers and they're not so many of them, so they're not so hard to go after in terms of commercial attack. And, it's a big need. I mean, it's a horrible thing to have to be given a new kidney and then lose it or to damage it through biopsies or testing it as you're worried about rejection. And half of all these are rejected within 10 years. So this is a tool that really has been needed and it's pee in a cup and it can be sent in. It doesn't have to be done with a non-contact with phlebotomist or something. So, we see a lot of upside in the price, the cost first and the price second is going to be I think really good compared to what's out there now. Catherine Schulte : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : And our next question is from Alex Nowak with Craig-Hallum. Please proceed with your question. Alex Nowak : Great, good morning everyone. So the vaccines are being administered now, more coming in soon. It looks like immunity to a particular variant actually might last pretty long, but then we're seeing new variants that come out to lower the overall efficacy. So I guess my question is how has the vaccine rollout and the emergence of these new variants changed your thinking around this quantitative COVID antibody tests? And then you mentioned it in the prepared remarks for where do you stand with partnering this test with the vaccine companies and then just separately, the diagnostic labs? Charles Kummeth : Yeah, well as you know, Alex, we've had this test kind of ready to go since late last spring. And, there's been I guess a lot of flutter and cluttered with the FDA and a lot of poor UAS that came out early on unqualitative versions of serology. And, and there's a bit of a hill to climb here for getting accepted. There won't be real demand until there's enough vaccine out there, enough people vaccinated to create that demand where they're calling their doctors to find out how do I find out if I'm immune or not, can I see my grandkids or not? People want to go back to concerts and get on planes and get on trains and be in malls again. And no one's going to feel really good until they know they feel safe. And this is without a variant, this is without a mutation. As you know we're tied at the hip of Mount Sinai and they've got the longest range testing known here on immunity and we're running at like seven or eight months. And they don't see a reduction in immunity with antibodies yet. But, the powers to be there do feel that it'll follow the Corona family and it will be variable with individual but between probably one and two years of immunity, but not forever. If it doesn't mutate, that means a booster, if it mutates then we're kind of looking at a flu every year kind of thing, right. Then we're trying to hit a moving target like flu does, which is harder.  All that speaks to the more of a need to have serology. People are going to want to know consistently are they immune. Do not be surprised if in a year or two on your app, on your phone, you're carrying an immunity passport and how you're doing with COVID so you can be led onto whatever or led into whatever. All that technology is coming and it's not coming in one full flush, which is a problem. Everything's slower than we want. Vaccinations are going slow. By summer we're not going to be probably at herd immunity yet. We're not going to be at a point where enough people are vaccinated we're going to feel safe. There's going to be a growing and growing demand for serology and we're hoping to get our quantitative claim be the only one given by the FDA very soon. All the data is submitted. We have actually from WHO -- we have the sample that'll give us the means to actually quantitate our standard curve to their, so there can be an international standard that the FDA is looking for to get behind. So, we're right in the thick of it, and we've got great partners with Mount Sinai. So, I do expect we'll get through it. And, over a year we probably will be the only one, but we will be a very -- we'll be the first one, we would be a very good one. But I think serology will be on the rise. I think, people in PCR, I think it's not going away either. It's going to be a much slower tail than people think. You've probably heard that in another call this week. Unfortunately, we're turning the curve but it's going to be a long tail on getting back to normality. And, then we're going to get a piece of this probably, nothing to the extent of some of the companies are there. They are answering the question am I sick? But, we're a research company first, this is all gravy for us. We expect to be helping and we're going to have a great piece of science to help with. Alex Nowak : Thanks, Chuck. That's very helpful. Maybe to expand on the more macro life science funding flush that you're seeing here. So right now, Washington is hashing out the COVID stimulus plan. What specifically are you hearing in that plan that could be funded, that could be deployed for life science research funding and for how long could that benefit lab? And then I guess the same question, but directed more towards China, their plans with the next five-year plan. Are you hearing anything in particular there? Jim Hippel : I will start reverse. China's not really good at laying out what they're going to do, but the demon we're looking at, I think the 14th version of a five-year plan, what typically happens is year one is a little bit soft and year two it kicks into high gear. Year five is a bit softer too and we had a bit of we'll call it budget flush over there too, because are also changing some tax consequences there. So I think everybody that had strong instrument results in China, probably we're seeing a little bit of pull forward from that. Haven't seen him much mentioned, but we certainly saw it and we'll admit to it. But I think, it's going to be really good. The next plan for China, I think healthcare is still way behind where they are in other parts of their economy and their industry. And, it's a lagging industry and now more than ever with COVID and they certainly don't want to see a pandemic hit there that people want health care there. I mean life sciences is on the rise still. That's why we continue to see 25% or better growth and, we will for a long time, I think. Charles Kummeth : I think as far as our government is concerned, whether it ends up being 600 million more or a billion more, or 1.9 billion, there's going to definitely be portions of this that are given as grants and been done for pandemic research and which really is infectious diseases, which there really hasn't been a whole lot of. Most of the NIH is really focused more on oncology neuroscience and different areas like that. I mean, as I've mentioned often, when's the last time you paid more than a dollar for an antibiotic. I mean, if there's -- we're behind in a lot of areas around infections and I think there'll be a lot of overflow in a halo effect from stimuli. I think that's one reason that's the official NIH budget for this year. Now it looks at looking at 3%. I think they're all holding off until they see what's going to really drift out around these stimulus packages into the science community, which I think there'll be some it's hard to quantify. I think there'll be some, if there's not you'll see, you'll see more, more, uh, pressure for the NIH to, to, to get more, I think. Alex Nowak : Okay, great. Thanks, Chuck, I appreciate it. Operator : And our next question is from Dan Arias with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Dan Arias : Good morning guys, thanks. Chuck, on the GMP proteins business, you've talked about pharma customers looking for a provider that can handle some pretty large orders. They're multi-million dollar lots. Do you have some of these in the pipeline or as semi firm commitment at this point? And then when we think about what you're prepared to do in terms of supplying here in initial days with the new facility, what is the plan for scaling up that portfolio, it sounds like the idea is to kind of start off with a couple of key molecules, and then work from there, so I'm just curious what the portfolio expansion ramp looks like and whether that's what you really need in order to sort of drive the acceleration that you've talked about recently? Charles Kummeth : Sure, well we landed our second and these contracts are -- they started years ago with these guys coming to us and asking, we have been buying proteins from you forever and we buy them in small lots and we're probably a large customer for you at maybe a $0.5 million a year. If we get into cell and gene therapies and we need proteins as part of the workflow, we need something like probably 10 or more million a year, could you do that and back then all we could say was, no, we couldn't. So now fast forward to here, this is more building a factory, even there we've improved our current site and headquarters that we can do probably upwards of about $40 million or so annually of GMP proteins here. So we've done a lot of good jobs and that\u2019s going to fill the gap while we qualify this factory and wait for the large orders, because we're not going to have a large venue, a large catalog here. We're going to have you making far less than 50 different proteins there. We are qualifying on the major runners and you can guess what they are, they start with an IL. And we'll go from there. Both these first two customers have needs of over 10 million a year, and we are in negotiation with at least a half a dozen others. And I won't tell you who, but one of them has a need for $50 million a year. What we've done with these customers, because it's hard for them to give us a forecast, we've talked to way these contract is that we are demanding 95% of their volume. Whatever they ended up needing, it's really an unknown right now, how these things take off, when they come out, what the forecast is going to be, what's the ramp, how do we plan for it? And they know it too. They know it's frustrating for us because how do you prepare? So what we've done is turned our contracting towards we want to see a range, what you need will be there. We don't know when, but we expect 95% of your volume that's contracted. So that's kind of the gist of how we're doing business. And these call them eight customers would swamp us out for a year if they hit their forecast, just these and there's another 50 to 100 after that. So we're not concerned about filling this factory eventually. Dan Arias : Yeah, okay. Okay and then maybe on the epi side, appreciate some of the comments that you made thus far. Leaving aside the dark visit dynamic and just the challenges related to the pandemic, what do you think the things are that the urology community needs to see this year in order to really feel like this is a test that's sort of a must use option rather than a nice to have option, is it additional data in publications, is it being seen by a sales rep now that you've kind of solidified the use case a little bit, I'm curious about what you think at this point, given where we are really kind of fulfills the dream here? Charles Kummeth : I know your latter comment. I think the utilities, the outcome studies, that's what the large payers are looking more for. And we're probably halfway there and we are very close to landing one of the majors, can't say that we have either but hopefully it's eminent. And when we get warm, we'll get more, but that's what they're looking for is the outcomes, how does it really save money for the industry, right and save more lives. The urologists, we've sold through roughly 2,500 of them and there's about 20,000. So we've got a lot of work to do. And of that 2577% are reordered. So once they're in it, they believe it. I think it really is more of a commercial issue of getting in front of them again and selling. And I think the home kits is still in part of the GAAP and certainly it is helping a lot. We have some great KOLs [ph], we're going to get back and front of NGS here in February for reconsideration, that's going to help quite a bit. I think that'll be a positive story. But I think it's a grind. I think these urologists, like a lot of different specialty doctors, they're hard to convert. I'm sure -- I'm certain a large portion of them enjoy their $1,500 a piece biopsies and know that they're mostly negative and don't care. So it's just the state of the business that we have to grind through them. We have to almost shame them into moving into this methodology because it's better for the patient, even though it's less revenue for them. And the better urologist get it and they're on board and we're converting them. But, it's not going to be a one-year event here. Dan Arias : Yup, understood. Okay, very good. Thanks, Chuck. Operator : Next question is from Jacob Johnson with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Jacob Johnson : Hey, thanks. And I'll add my congrats on a really nice quarter. Just Chuck one question on the outlook for this year, and I want to make sure I'm clear on your comment earlier. You're lapping I think a similar organic growth quarter or gain a growth number next quarter, and then obviously much easier comp in the fourth quarter. Is there any reason organic growth shouldn't be at this 19% level, like this quarter or potentially higher at the next couple of quarters? Charles Kummeth : I'm going to let my esteemed CFO, answer that one for you. Jim Hippel : Yeah, hi Jacob. The way we're thinking about the forecast is more about the clear momentum we have in the business and the sequential of that momentum going forward as opposed to year-over-year growth rates cause it gets wonky, especially in Q4 for us with what happened in Q4 last year. So the way we're thinking about it is that the momentum from the absolute revenue perspective, continuing, if history is any guide usually our Q3 and Q4 -- fiscal Q3 and Q4 are slightly higher than our second quarter if nothing else, because there's less holidays within those quarters as they are in November and December timeframe. So that's kind of how we're thinking about it. We think the momentum that we saw -- that the step up in momentum that we saw in absolute terms in Q2 is with us, at least for the rest of this fiscal year. And so that's kind of how we're thinking about the forecast going forward. Jacob Johnson : Got it. Thanks for that, Jim. And then Chuck you made some interesting comments on TCBuster earlier. It sounds like business development efforts are going well there, can you give us any more details on where that offering stands, maybe how many customers you're working with, any color around that? And then you mentioned the potential to maybe add some capacity. Would that suggest that the opportunity here could be greater than I think that kind of 50 million revenue aspirations you've previously outlined? Charles Kummeth : I think it's more about the ramp and acceleration to that 50 million. I don't think we know enough yet. The gene editing portion of the workflow is if not the most expensive, not the most valuable part of the workflow. It is a critical part obviously and we'll see. Given the domain of customers is a little over a hundred as you know, and we are certainly working with a couple dozen and we are certainly sold to more than half a dozen, quite a few. And they are coming in bigger chunks. So they get access and do a trial, it's hundreds of thousands of dollars. So, we're in the millions now for revenue with TCBuster. So it's starting to get there. This thing's going to happen. Unfortunately, it's a critical part of a brand new workflow for a cell and gene therapy that's radically different than using viral approaches. So it's kind of next generation. So we've got to kind of grind through getting a half a dozen, two dozen of these guys lined up and get them into their clinical and then get going on it. I think this one really is a J curve for five years from now to the 50, 60, or whatever it ends up being. But, it's going to -- it's also going to probably be growth rates of 50% to 100% starting now for the next two, three years until it grows even faster as it really ramps as these things go into production. Jacob Johnson : Got it. Thanks for taking the questions. Operator : Our next question is from Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Please proceed with your questions. Patrick Donnelly : Hey guys, thanks for taking the questions. Chuck, maybe just on the ACD side, nice to see that back to growth pre-pandemic, even beyond that. Can you just talk a little -- more color on what you're seeing in that market and expectations going forward again, certainly feels like it's found its footing here and what can we expect over the next few quarters there? Charles Kummeth : Yeah, I think given the likes of other companies in the domain Nanostring and 10X and others, spatial and they're all helping. They're helping create an industry, right? So we're all working on creating a spatial analysis and there's a big need for spatial analysis in the workflow for all research and proteomics for one as well as other areas. So it really comes down to that. If you need to do down to single cell analysis and you really care about the morphology of your tissue sample, which is precious, this is a great technology. Also other technologies that use antibodies, sometimes you can't find the antibodies or they aren't working well, or they're not producible. Looking for a gene is much more -- it's much more on or off, it's there or not. And so this technology with the Z probe [ph] that could detect and get the signal it's full-proof. So, that's why we're seeing the lift. I think a lot of our softness, couple of years ago, we had to reorganize Europe. Europe is just on fire now, the plans really are definitely working in Europe. Europe is doing great. We had over 20% growth in Europe this quarter. So it's a nice thing to see and our genomics division had a big part of it. We're also seeing good growth across the board in Asia as well, although smaller starting to catch on. And, we've mentioned RNAscope and base scope, they're also growing nicely and our High Plex, our multiplex version is starting to grow. We'll, get an FFP version of the High Plex out here soon that will really be really needed, I think and compete well with what's out there. And then of course, DNA scope is coming at the end of this fiscal year we hope. And, that's another platform. So it's a great pipeline. It's got a lot of legs. Again, we see a $200 million to $300 million division here with this technology in our five-year plan and it keeps growing at the near 30% growth. It's back to a -- it won't take that long. Patrick Donnelly : Yes, no, that's helpful. And then one for Jim, just on the margin side, can you just talk through kind of how we should think about that going forward, including, the Exo impact. I know that Medicare shifted over to accrual based accounting this year. So maybe just the impact of Exo on the margins and expectations as we approach kind of that 40% you've talked about for a little while here. Jim Hippel : Yeah. And I think we've shared this last quarter. It's a similar story this quarter, if you exclude Exosome from our results, the total company would have been in the low forties with regards to our adjusted operating margin. So that'll give you some insight as to the dilution impact of Exo currently. With regards to the margin profile, second half versus first half, I mean. The margin performance has far exceeded our expectations, but mainly because we are behind on our investment plan, as I've mentioned even last quarter, right. So, it is absolutely important that we continue to invest in our R&D pipelines and our customer facing and customer service post sale service in order to maintain this momentum. So, we do expect to get caught up on those investments and if we are successful in doing so, our margin profile, we think will be slightly less than the back-half than it is in the front half. It's still very, very strong compared to last year. And ahead of plan of where we thought we'd be at this point in time and track to a total comfy performance of North of 40% in the next couple of years. Patrick Donnelly : Understood. Thanks guys. Operator : And we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session, and I'll now turn the call over to management for any closing remarks. Charles Kummeth : Well, thanks everyone. It was a record quarter. We enjoyed it. We enjoyed this call. We know they're not all like this. We hope we don't have one of those other kind very soon. And, we look forward to seeing the next quarter and it should be a great second half this year we think. So let's tune in again next quarter, thank you. Operator : And this concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to David Clair, Bio-Techne\u2019s Senior Director Investor Relations and Corporate Development. David Clair : Good morning and thank you for joining us. On the call with me this morning are Chuck Kummeth, Chief Executive Officer and Jim Hippel, Chief Financial Officer of Bio-Techne. Before we begin, let me briefly cover our Safe Harbor statement. Some of the comments made during this conference call maybe considered forward-looking statements, including beliefs and expectations about the company\u2019s future results as well as the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and financial results. The company\u2019s 10-K for fiscal year 2020 identifies certain factors that could cause the company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements made during this call. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of any new information or future events or developments. The 10-K as well as the company\u2019s other SEC filings are available on the company\u2019s website within its Investor Relations section. During the call, non-GAAP financial measures maybe used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. Tables reconciling these measures to most comparable GAAP measures are available in the company\u2019s press release issued earlier this morning on the Bio-Techne Corporation website at www.bio-techne.com. I will now turn the call over to Chuck. Chuck Kummeth : Thanks, Dave and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter conference call. As you read in our press release earlier this morning, I am very pleased to announce that the Bio-Techne team delivered again another strong quarter in our fiscal Q3. Our year-over-year organic growth accelerated 22% for the quarter as we continue to build on momentum from the first half of our fiscal year. This growth was the best organic growth the company has delivered in over 25 years both year-over-year as well as on a 2-year CAGR basis. As it has been all year, the growth in Q3 was broad-based across our segments and geographies as penetration into biopharma remained very strong and continued improvement in academia drove the year-over-year and sequential acceleration in our business. The growth between our product categories was also broad-based with most accelerating sequentially from Q2 and continued by leadership from our Simple Plex, Simple Western, cell and gene therapy and genomics platforms. As we have been doing all year, we delivered our record organic growth with a focus on profitability, achieving 40.1% adjusted operating margin for the quarter. The timing of hiring to support growth investments, combined with COVID-restricted travel, once again benefited our profitability. However, our positioning in high growth markets, with high gross margin products has strengthened the conviction in our ability to sustain 40% operating margins in the future pursuant to our strategic plan. Before we dive deeper into our Q3 performance, I would like to welcome the Asuragen team to Bio-Techne. As a reminder, we announced the Asuragen acquisition in early March and closed the transaction in early April. Asuragen adds a portfolio of leading genetic carrier screening and oncology research products and diagnostic kits complements our legacy clinical controls business with molecular diagnostic controls and brings a pipeline of high value products to accelerate its penetration and growth. The Asuragen team also brings deep diagnostic commercialization and regulatory expertise, which we will leverage to accelerate the growth of our clinical platforms across the organization. Unlike many diagnostic companies of its size, Asuragen is already profitable, and we anticipate this business to be accretive to Bio-Techne\u2019s top line growth and accretive to our Diagnostics and Genomics segment operating margin over time. I look forward to giving you all updates on Asuragen\u2019s progress in coming quarters. Now let\u2019s discuss the performance of our growth platform, starting with the Protein Sciences segment, where growth accelerated to 24% organically in the quarter. Our core proteomic research reagent portfolio had another strong quarter, with research use only proteins growing nearly 10% and antibodies growing in the mid-teens. Our newest proteins are more frequently being used in mRNA research and production. Given the recent success and growing interest in mRNA-based vaccines, this could be a sustainable growth driver for this product line going forward. Meanwhile, our antibody business continues to benefit from our custom antibody service business, which grew over 50% in Q3. The catalog of over 6,000 proteins and approximately 450,000 antibody variations, we have amassed not only enabled scientific research, but also has potential therapeutic applications. This potential is supported by the recently announced licensing agreement with Xencor, a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing engineered monoclonal antibodies and cytokines for the treatment of cancer and autoimmune diseases. Xencor is now evaluating a third proprietary Bio-Techne antibody for its therapeutic development pipeline. This agreement speaks to the potential value of vast protein and antibody content we have built over the last 30-plus years and represents a largely untapped potential revenue stream for the company. Our leadership in antibodies has also not gone unnoticed in our industry, with Bio-Techne\u2019s R&D Systems and Novus brands recently named winners of the CiteAb for COVID-19 Innovation Award. This award celebrates innovative solutions or products that help shape the life sciences sector\u2019s understanding of or resilience to COVID-19. The COVID-19 Innovation Award reflects Bio-Techne\u2019s quick and impactful response to the COVID-19 pandemic, developing and commercializing new antibodies to support research as well as COVID-19 testing initiatives. This represents the fifth consecutive year of Bio-Techne\u2019s antibody innovation efforts have been recognized with the CiteAb Award, and we are very proud of our antibody team. During Q3, we also continued to make significant progress advancing our cell and gene therapy initiatives, including our GMP protein business. As a reminder, GMP proteins are a key ingredient in a cell and gene therapy workflow, providing the nutrients to grow the genetically modified cells prior to being infused back into the patient. Our portfolio of GMP proteins increased over 90% in the quarter as customers leveraged our GMP cytokines to advance immune cell and regenerative medicine therapies. We continue to scale our state-of-the-art GMP production facility with qualifications completed and production lots of initial proteins currently underway. We have launched a digital marketing campaign to promote the new facility, our capacity and capabilities. This marketing message is resonating with the cell and gene therapy industry as our final potential GMP protein supply agreements with biopharma customers continue to grow in Q3. We are also building momentum in market awareness and acceptance of another key component of our cell and gene therapy workflow solution, TcBuster, our novel, nonviral transposon-based gene delivery system. During Q3, we announced the signing of a licensing agreement with Luminary Therapeutics for the use of TcBuster in their development of a BAFF- CAR-T therapeutic. Our genomic engineering service business, which includes the TcBuster solution, is gaining traction with customers, developing cell and gene therapies with a growing funnel of biopharma companies, relying on our experience in hard-to-transfect cell lines to deliver solutions for the complex projects. Bio-Techne\u2019s reach into cell and gene therapy is much broader than our best-in-class GMP proteins and TcBuster technologies. Biopharma companies, CROs and CDMOs are increasingly relying on offerings across Bio-Techne\u2019s portfolio, including antibodies, media and supplements as well as our portfolio of analytical tools, including Simple Western, Simple Plex, RNAscope and our Maurice instrument to develop and scale their cell and gene therapy manufacturing capabilities. We have united our business leaders from across the company to develop strategies on how our products and technologies can be best positioned to create synergistic solutions and maximize productivity for these customers. Now, let\u2019s discuss the proteomic and analytical tools portion of our Protein Sciences segment, where the strength we experienced in recent quarters continued into our Q3. Once again, our automated multiplex immunoassay solution, Simple Plex, had a stellar quarter, with revenue increasing 90% globally. Simple Plex\u2019 ability to deliver high-quality and reproducible data with a sub-picogram level of sensitivity in a smaller footprint, comparatively less expensive offering, continues to drive awareness, interest, placements and utilization of the platform. We are seeing increased Simple Plex adoption from cell and gene therapy customers and the broader biopharma industry as they leverage the platform for biomarker discovery, immune cell characterization and quality control processes. We also helped accelerate broader adoption in Q3 by expanding Simple Plex\u2019 immunoassay cartridge portfolio to include 9 new cartridge formats. These new cartridge offerings provide Simple Plex users with increased flexibility in a number of samples and biomarker assays run on each cartridge. Until now, Simple Plex assay cartridges were only available in formats delivering 1, 4 or 8 assays run simultaneously. The expanded portfolio of cartridge offerings provides users new options to better align their assay panels with the throughput requirements of their studies. Finally, to keep up with the high demand for our Simple Plex solution, we have added a second manufacturing shift in Q3 and are in the initial stages of expanding our physical capacity to meet the forecasted demand, as Simple Plex\u2019 value proposition continues to resonate with customers in need of a fully automated, cost-effective multiplexing solution. It was a similar stellar quarter for our fully automated Western platform, Simple Western, with year-over-year growth accelerating to approximately 50% in Q3. Even with the rapid adoption of Simple Western that we have seen for many quarters now, we continue to invest in the future of this platform and expand its addressable market. For example, we recently introduced the latest number of the Simple Western family, an instrument we call Abby. This lower-cost platform offers picogram level sensitivity with the ability to perform sequential chemiluminescent assays within the same capillary, a feature we introduced in our higher-end Jess instrument last year called RePlex. Academic customers have been increasingly adopting our automated Western platforms to alleviate COVID-induced limitations on their lab activities and maximize productivity, and we anticipate Abby\u2019s features and cost profile to increase penetration of this technology into this customer segment. Finally, our biologics instruments, which provide protein purity information and are used directly in bioprocessing, also had a standout quarter with over 30% growth as we continue to experience broad demand from biopharma, including several companies with COVID-19 vaccines in various stages of development or commercialization as well as continued interest from companies working on cell and gene therapies. Now I will provide an update on our Diagnostics and Genomics portfolio, where organic revenue increased 17% in Q3. Let\u2019s start with an update on our ACD or tissue pathology franchise, where organic revenue increased above 40% for the quarter, with RNAscope, BaseScope and our multiplexing technology, HiPlex, all having a very strong quarter. ACD is seeing significant traction with cell and gene therapy applications, with RNAscope representing the only currently available method for understanding single cell biodistribution information within the context of tissue histology. This information is critical to understanding the safety and efficacy profile of gene and RNAi therapies. And as a result, RNAscope is being used by these companies on many IND-enabling studies. ACD is also being increasingly used as a validation technology following superplexing experiments with the single cell resolution and spatial information provided by our solutions, supporting the move from discovery to translational research. We remain in the early stages of penetrating both the research and clinical potential of this exciting technology and have plenty of room for continued growth. As we look ahead to Q4 and FY \u201822, we are very excited about a new product to the ACD family that we launched recently, which leverages RNAscope technology and expand its addressable market. Bio-Techne\u2019s new chromogenic DNA in situ hybridization technology, DNAscope, employs a proven double-Z probe design and signal amplification system of RNAscope, enabling a rapid and flexible probe development for any DNA target and enabling visualization of targets in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. DNAscope delivers benefits over current commercial FISH techniques that fall short on morphological details due to the use of fluorescent nuclear staining that rely on a high-resolution microscopy to visualize gene rearrangement and copy number variation signals. Additionally, traditional, FISH uses bacterial artificial chromosome back cone-based probes that are large and tend to span multiple genes and lack single gene detection specificity. Unlike most commercially available assays, DNAscope utilizes oligo probes, coupled with proprietary signal amplification system, to enable high resolution and precise target detection for small genomic regions in single gene locus. Now, let\u2019s discuss our Exosome Diagnostics liquid biopsy platform, starting with our prostate cancer liquid biopsy assay, the ExoDx Prostate test. While urology practices have largely reopened at this point, the older population, that is the primary audience for the ExoDx Prostate test, has remained hesitant to visit their doctor or urologists due to COVID-related concerns. Clearly, a headwind to test volume since the pandemic began. During Q3, we experienced a continued recovery of ExoDx Prostate test volumes, with March representing the best month for test sample inflow since the beginning of the pandemic. We are encouraged with the volume trajectory we experienced in March and anticipate continued momentum in this business as vaccinations continue to work their way through the population and patients return to their physicians for checkups and their urologists for our ExoDx Prostate test. Private payers are increasingly recognizing the patient benefits and cost savings ExoDx Prostate delivers by avoiding unnecessary biopsies as well as the strong dossier of data we have supporting the efficacy and clinical utility of the test. During Q3, this recognition led to a contracted coverage decision with Humana, the first national payer to issue a favorable coverage decision. We remain in discussions with several other national and regional payers and look forward to expanding access to this test and enabling additional men to make more informed decisions on whether to defer or proceed with prostate biopsy. We have also expanded our geographic reach with the ExoDx Prostate test by completing its clinical validation with self-enabled certification as a CE-IVD kit as of March 22, 2021. The EPI CE tests will be performed in our Munich ISO 15189-accredited clinical laboratory and be made available throughout Europe through various distribution channels beginning in Q4. In addition to the ExoDx Prostate test, we continue to advance our pipeline of novel exosome-based liquid biopsy products. In Q3, we announced initial data on our next commercial test, ExoTRU, an assay designed to detect kidney transplant rejection. Initial data supporting the potential of ExoTRU was published in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, with the assay capable of discriminating between any cause rejection and no rejection with a negative predictive value of 93.3% and positive predictive value of 77.8%. We view this initial data as best-in-class compared to competing kidney transplant rejection assays. ExoTRU is not just differentiated with best-in-class data. This test uses urine, not blood, as the sample which opens up opportunities for at-home sample collection, allowing these immuno-uncompromised patients to the ability to take the test in the comfort of their home and avoid a trip to the hospital for a blood draw. We look forward to launching ExoTRU later in calendar 2021. The COVID-related headwinds and restrictions have not just impacted our ExosomeDx test volumes, with patients deferring routine visits to physicians also impacting broader diagnostic testing volumes. Despite these ongoing challenges, our Diagnostic Reagents division increased mid-single digits during Q3. This is the seventh quarter in a row that our Diagnostic Reagents division has delivered positive growth, as the development pipeline and new COVID-related opportunities continue to smooth out the impact of what can sometimes be lumpy bulk reagent orders. I would like to now give an update on our COVID-19 initiatives. Since the start of the pandemic, Bio-Techne\u2019s reagents and instruments have enabled insights into the virus, including ACD probes to detect the virus in tissue, sales of bulk diagnostic reagents used in COVID testing applications as well as pathogen-specific by antibodies and proteins to known variants of the COVID virus. COVID was an estimated 3% tailwind to our business in Q3, including initial revenue from sales of the Kantaro IgG antibody serology kit. We expect the COVID research and diagnostics will be around for many years, particularly as new viral strains continue to emerge, making this tailwind a sustained new layer of our product portfolio going forward. Our business is clearly firing on all cylinders. Our innovative portfolio of proteomic research reagents and analytical tools, tissue biopsy and spatial products are meeting the productivity needs of the scientific community to drive research and discoveries forward. Our emerging cell and gene therapy workflow solutions are set to enable the next class of biological therapies with increased efficiency at lower cost. And our liquid biopsy platform is expanding with the best-in-class assay for kidney transplant patients in need of a better solution for detecting allograft rejection. Layer on this, a favorable research funding environment, and I believe Bio-Techne is in the best position ever, or at least since I\u2019ve been with the company, to deliver on our long-term revenue and profitability aspirations, which keeps getting bigger every year. With that, I will turn the call over to Jim. Jim Hippel : Thanks, Chuck. I will provide an overview of our Q3 fiscal 2021 financial performance for the total company, provide some additional details on the performance of each of our segments and give some thoughts on the remainder of our fiscal year. Starting with the overall third quarter financial performance, adjusted EPS was $1.79 versus $1.39 1 year ago, an increase of 29% over last year, representing a new company record. Foreign exchange negatively impacted EPS by $0.04. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $1.12 compared to $0.92 in the prior year, representing a 22% increase year-over-year. Q3 revenue was $243.6 million, an increase of 25% year-over-year on a reported basis and 22% on an organic basis. Foreign exchange translation had a favorable 3% impact on our revenue. All geographies had strong growth in Q3, led by China growing nearly 50%, followed by EMEA with over 30% growth and in the Americas with growth north of 20%. The rest of the world grew in the low teens. You will recall that last year was the start of a pandemic, which severely hit China and, to a slightly lesser extent, Europe in our Q3 fiscal year \u201820. Our business in the U.S. was not materially impacted by pandemic shutdowns until April of last year. Hence, the comps in Q3 this year were easier in China and Europe than the U.S. That being said, China\u2019s revenue in Q3 of this year was still nearly 60% higher than the same quarter in fiscal year \u201819, and Europe\u2019s revenue was over 20% higher than Q3 of fiscal year \u201819, while the Americas revenue is up over 35% from the same quarter in fiscal year \u201819. By end market, biopharma continues to be very strong with year-over-year growth well over 25%, while academia continues to make big improvements, growing approximately 20% for the quarter compared to last year. Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin was 72.9% in the quarter compared to 71.5% in the prior year. The increase is primarily driven by favorable product mix and volume leverage. Adjusted SG&A in Q3 was 25.8% of revenue, a 100 basis point decrease compared to the prior year, and R&D expense in Q3 was 7% of revenue, 120 basis points lower than the prior year. While our adjusted SG&A and R&D spend both increased sequentially and versus the prior year, a tight labor market in the life science space did not allow us to fill all planned headcount additions to the team at the pace we had anticipated, especially in the more technical scientific and engineering fields. However, our pace of hiring did increase over the course of Q3, and we still plan to fill remaining open positions in Q4. This investment in critical human capital positioned the company for growth going forward. The resulting adjusted operating margin in Q3 was 40.1%, an increase of 360 basis points from the prior year and 140 basis point sequential improvement from Q2 the highest adjusted operating margin for the company in 6 years. Looking at our numbers below operating income, net interest expense in Q3 was $2.5 million, decreasing $1.7 million compared to the prior year period. The decrease was due to a continued reduction of our bank debt during fiscal 2021 as well as lower floating rates. Our bank debt on the balance sheet as of the end of Q3 stood at $215.4 million. Other adjusted non-operating expense was $4.1 million for the quarter compared to $3 million of income in the prior year, primarily reflecting the foreign exchange impact related to our cash pooling arrangements. For GAAP reporting, other non-operating income included unrealized losses from our investment in ChemoCentryx. Moving further down the P&L, our adjusted effective tax rate in Q3 was 20.2%, a 110 basis point improvement over the prior year, with the improvement primarily driven by geographic mix. We expect our effective tax rate going forward to be consistent with Q3, barring no changes in corporate tax law. Note that the GAAP effective tax rate in Q3 was favorably impacted by the discrete timing of stock option exercises. As a reminder, during Q2, we made a strategic equity investment in China-based Eminence, a company focused on providing media as well as custom cell line development and media formulation services to the Chinese biopharmaceutical market. The $380,000 non-controlling interest line item on the P&L reflects the loss on the portion of Eminence we do not own. The impact to other lines of the P&L as a result of consolidating Eminence was immaterial in Q3. Turning to cash flow and return of capital, $74.9 million of cash was generated from operations in the quarter, more than a 50% increase over the prior year. In Q3, our net investment in capital expenditures was $10.6 million. And during Q3, we returned $55.6 million of capital to shareholders by way of $12.4 million in dividends and $43.2 million in stock buyback. We finished Q3 with 40.7 million average diluted shares outstanding. Our balance sheet finished Q3 in a very strong position with $276.2 million in cash and short-term available-for-sale investments and essentially 0 net debt leverage position. Next, I will discuss the performance of our reporting segments, starting with the Protein Sciences segment. Q3 reported sales were $185.6 million, with reported revenue increasing 28%. Organic growth increased 24%, with foreign exchange having a favorable impact of 4% on revenue growth. Within the segment, the strong growth was very broad-based with double-digit growth in nearly all reagent assay and instrument platforms. As Chuck described in his remarks, platforms of notable mention include Simple Plex, Simple Western, biologics and cell and gene therapy, especially pertaining to GMP proteins as well as our core proteomic reagent business. Operating margin for the Protein Sciences segment was 47.6%, an increase of 290 basis points year-over-year due primarily to favorable volume leverage and cost management. Turning to the Diagnostics and Genomics segment, Q3 reported sales were $58.1 million, with reported revenue increasing 18%. Organic growth of the segment was 17%, with foreign exchange translation having a favorable 1% impact on revenue. Similar to the first half of our fiscal year, our Genomics division led this segment in the quarter. We experienced strength across the entire ACD-branded portfolio with RNAscope, miRNAscope, BaseScope and our diagnostic partnership with Leica, all driving growth. Exosome Diagnostics\u2019 Q3 revenue increased over 20% from last year, with strong revenue from our companion diagnostic partnerships, driving the growth as our ExoDx Prostate test continue to recover from the pandemic lows experienced in our fiscal Q4 of last year. And as Chuck mentioned, our Diagnostics Reagents division continued its growth streak by executing on COVID-related opportunities to offset the headwinds many of its traditional OEM diagnostic customers are facing with patients forgoing routine visits to the doctors. Moving on to the Diagnostics and Genomics segment operating margin at 17.9%, the segment\u2019s operating margin improved 360 basis points compared to the prior year. The increase reflects strong volume leverage in our Genomics division as well as strong cost management across the segment. In summary, the momentum we experienced in the first half of our fiscal 2021 accelerated during Q3. With 17% organic revenue growth year-to-date, our products remain at the forefront of science, enabling cutting-edge scientific and therapeutic discoveries, while our key growth drivers remain under-penetrated in large and growing markets. We believe that COVID pandemic has elevated the profile and market awareness of our tools and solution offerings, positioning Bio-Techne to exit the pandemic stronger than before the pandemic hit. This brings us to our thoughts on how we might close the year. In short, for our base business, we see Q4 looking very strong and similar to Q3, both on the top line in terms of absolute revenue and on bottom line in terms of adjusted EPS. With most of our customers, both in biopharma and academia, now back to work, and with the need and priority to fund medical research still high in both the private and public sector, we see the strong revenue run rate we experienced in Q3 continuing into Q4. To fuel and support further revenue growth in fiscal year \u201822 and beyond, it is critical that we catch up on the growth investments that were in our strategic plan to accomplish this year. As I have already mentioned, we made good progress at the end of Q3 on hiring the human capital needed, and we see that continuing into Q4, as we fully expect our adjusted operating margins to finish sequentially lower than Q3 but still significantly higher than the prior year as well as higher than previous analysts\u2019 consensus estimates. Also, we expect the acquisition of Asuragen in April to contribute 2% to 3% sequentially more revenue on top of our base business in Q4. However, as Asuragen has just recently become profitable, it will likely be dilutive to our overall adjusted operating margins in Q4 by approximately 100 basis points. That concludes my prepared comments. And with that, I will turn the call over to Maria to open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is with Dan Arias with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Dan Arias : Hi, guys. Good morning. Congrats on the performance that you are seeing here. Very strong. Can you just talk a bit about the early days of servicing your customers with the expanded GMP capabilities? Are you seeing the orders come in the way that you had hoped and then how should we think about building out the portfolio there? And the reason I ask is because if I am thinking about the situation right, it sounds like one of the key factors that will influence the ramp will just be the pace of expansion of the catalog? So, can you just sort of touch on growing the product set there such that you feel like that will be less of a limiting factor than it might be in the near-term? Chuck Kummeth : Yes. I will start kind of from the back forward. It won\u2019t be a limitation of the catalog. We have got the most full GMP catalog already in the world. It\u2019s just a matter of qualification and getting in inventory. So, the issue is all commercial and it\u2019s all waiting for this industry to really happen. So we have had a really good quarter. We are further along with a dozen or so customers. We have talked about a couple of we have locked in already. It\u2019s hard for them to talk about forecasts and numbers and stuff. So we\u2019ve contracted in terms of percents, and we\u2019ve had no issue with contracting at 95% of their needs, whatever their needs be. And I have talked in the past about they range anywhere from $10 million a year to over $50 million of just like a single protein. So we\u2019re making progress. We\u2019re also getting help because with ScaleReady out there, we have got a dozen different people in commercial between sales and technical. They are starting to drive more interest and awareness, and that\u2019s also helping find our way to more potential business more quickly. It\u2019s still a J curve like we have talked about. I mean \u2013 so you\u2019ve been keeping track of the model, and we\u2019ve been talking about the growth rate. So you can do the math and you will see that we\u2019re at a $15 million, $16 million run rate right now at GMP proteins. I\u2019ve talked in the past that even on this site here, Minneapolis headquarters, we can make as much as $40 million. So we\u2019ve got plenty of time here before we exhaust our capacity before we have to have this factory turned on. And we\u2019ve slipped a couple of months, but we\u2019re looking at September, October to be selling out inventory, but we\u2019re qualifying and making lots right now. So we\u2019re in good place. It\u2019s more about what do we got to do for commercialization to accelerate, and they come in two varieties. They come in new specs for new indications coming, which you\u2019ve got a pretty good pipeline of stuff and then doing a conversion of things that are in clinicals right now and going through \u2013 talking them into equivalency studies. So if they have nothing else at least a backup protein. So we are making progress on all those fronts, and it has really nothing to do with the catalog. We have got the best catalog and the best proteins. We can make anything you heard about that\u2019s needed out there for GMP proteins. And as I have mentioned also before, I think what the world thinks they need today, I think in 5 years will be radically different. And who would you rather put your trust in, the world leader in protein design or people who focus more on instruments or other parts of the workflow? I think over time, these proteins are going to continue to differentiate themselves for different reasons and where it\u2019s going to play to our strength, because we make the best protein in the world period, so... Dan Arias : Okay, helpful. And then maybe just moving over to Simple Plex, I mean, you are going to be rounding out a pretty big year there. How are you feeling about carrying that strength into next year? My initial thought a couple of quarters ago was that a lot of those systems were being driven by COVID, but it also sounds like cell and gene and some unrelated areas are in \u2013 at least been right there? Chuck Kummeth : You may have noticed that our numbers are even bigger this quarter. So we have found ways to make more. We\u2019ve been throttled because of just we couldn\u2019t make anymore. It\u2019s hard to grow an instrument business at 90%. So talk to anybody. And now we have also beefed up our cartridge lines. We have more flexibility. We keep expanding our analyte lines, so the things that go in the cartridges for the customers. So we are giving them more flexibility, but it really comes down like I said, it\u2019s biomarker discovery. It\u2019s QC applications. It\u2019s being looked at and being highly received by cell and gene therapy applications. So, all these things are way beyond our expectations 4 or 5 years ago. And then there are diagnostics applications that we really are just getting started on. We\u2019re in the middle of a 510(k) per process. Of course, we\u2019ve got the partner in China, and they\u2019re going through their own. So this thing is one of the big sleepers of our company and we\u2019ve got to get a new building. We have got to expand capacity. It\u2019s more than just adding shifts. We are all over this, right up there with exosome being the number one \u2013 number two priorities in the company, and we expect momentum to continue. We are now well over 500 boxes out there. That\u2019s kind of a tipping point where things start selling themselves. People start seeing them. The word of mouth gets out. Just like we did with Simple Western a couple of years ago, there was a tipping point where it just got a lot easier and we are reaching that point now with Simple Plex. Dan Arias : Okay. And just I guess a simple way of thinking about it would be to say that if you are expanding manufacturing the way that you are there, then obviously you have got a decent line of sight into some out-year demand that should pickup? Chuck Kummeth : Yes. And I think you got to look at the competition here is Quanterix and they have done a good job. I just read their print this morning and they beat as well. It just speaks to the need what this industry is opening up. There is a need for highly sensitive multiplexing immunoassay systems. And right now there is only a couple of really good ones out there. It\u2019s kind of us and Quanterix that are sensitive enough and ours just happens to be about one-tenth the size and one-tenth the price and still highly sensitive. So we are catching up to them, but I think there is room for both of us. I think it\u2019s a really expanding market for all these different applications I just mentioned. It\u2019s kind of unknown. It\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s going to get big. Dan Arias : Yes, okay. Okay, thanks Chuck. Operator : Our next question is with Puneet Souda with SVB Leerink. Please proceed with your question. Puneet Souda : Hey, great. Thanks. Thanks, Chuck. So first of all, congrats on a strong quarter here, great to see the strong growth and really impressive operating margin here. The key question is how sustainable is that? And Jim addressed some of that is based on what you expect to see here in the fourth quarter, but given the sort of the pent-up demand that\u2019s already there, the reagents and consumables, which are more easier to order and if you look back into the sort of the second half of the calendar year or the next fiscal year, obviously comps get tougher. So, maybe just speak to us in terms of how long of a sort of sustainable tail that you see here? Chuck Kummeth : Yes. Well, first of all, we put a pretty key phrase in the commentary from Jim. We talked about revenues being similar in Q4 to Q3 on a dollar basis, when you do the math, that\u2019s a big growth rate, that\u2019s going to give us something north of 20% if we hit that and momentum looks very strong right. So, whether you talk about for the year or take it for 2 years, it\u2019s double-digit for 2 years too almost teens. So \u2013 and then you got to talk about, well, we are hitting on all cylinders. Everything is growing amazingly well. It speaks to the industry. It speaks to the funding. It speaks to us crossing all these tipping points as a company. It speaks to our digital presence and our investments and just the awareness of our company and our platform. The quality has always been there in a lot of our brands, but we are expanding it. It speaks to us being able to entice companies to come on board like Asuragen. I don\u2019t think we could have talked them they come on board 3, 4 years ago. They see the candy in the store, and they want it. They want to help out. So we see in the Q1 and Q2 and our further next year, probably is not a 20% year, but it\u2019s going to be strong. And right now, it\u2019s too early to talk about what that could be. We\u2019ve listened to all the other peers out there, and everyone is staying kind of shy about next year. Comps are going to be tough, but you got to look at the market indicators. They are crazy good and we are going to be good. Jim Hippel : Puneet, I would just add, I think we\u2019re a bit beyond the point of pent-up demand. I think at the end of our Q2, we had a 19% quarter. We had some questions among ourselves to how much that might have been some pent-up demand. But I think by the time we get here into Q3, that\u2019s no longer the case. What we\u2019re seeing is a really sustainable run rate. In fact, if anything, the momentum accelerated throughout Q3 as opposed to leveling off or sloping downwards. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s pent-up demand at this point. I think it\u2019s ongoing funding. Puneet Souda : Got it. And then, Jim, on operating margin, you are suggesting that these are sustainable in the near-term, but how are you thinking about those longer term given the level of investment that you want to do in the business? And obviously, you have done successful acquisitions here in the past and so how should we think about that operating margin profile longer term? Jim Hippel : Yes. So, if that\u2019s how you define long-term and short-term, but I think the message I am trying to convey here is that the fact we were able to hit 40% well ahead of our \u2013 well ahead of schedule, some of it for some reasons that like travel and things like that were unforeseen a couple of years ago. But the point being is that we have a highly profitable business model and it shows that we can get to 40% and we have that much more confidence we can get that on a sustained basis going forward in the long-term. In the short-term, we need to catch up on some investments and that short \u2013 that catch up on investments will bring that rate down for a while in the short-term until we grow back up and get back to 40%. Chuck Kummeth : But still on plan for our previous guidance. Jim Hippel : I would argue ahead of plan. Chuck Kummeth : Ahead of plan. Jim Hippel : So, I think compared to fiscal year \u201819 and definitely compared to fiscal year \u201820, we are well ahead of plan on that trajectory. Things look good. We are getting great leverage. And we have \u2013 this quarter was a lot more investment than in the previous quarter. So, we have got great leverage as you saw in our numbers off of our scale and that\u2019s going to continue. Puneet Souda : Okay, okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And Chuck, on proteomics obviously proteins are very much core to you, great to see the growth here in Simple Plex and all the platforms and ProteinSimple. And when you think about the antibodies portfolio that you have, the combination with Simple Plex, how are you thinking about proteomics now? Obviously, there \u2013 in linker technologies, Olink and others that are emerging on the market after MERS and other approaches that are coming onto the market, so how are you thinking about proteomics overall? Are there opportunities that you think where you can potentially expand into and how do you see the benefit flowing from that to \u2013 broadly to the antibodies portfolio? Chuck Kummeth : Don\u2019t forget, most of these people you mentioned are also our customers, first off \u2013 first and foremost. And we enjoy great relationships with almost anybody in the field of proteomics. I think the core underlying growth level for just on the basic research is phenomenal. I do think that avenues like Soma and Olink are high-plexing kind of different niche, high-value applications that drive a lot of value and \u2013 but I think we will reach into those spaces as well to work with them and probably compete with them, but we will be never giving up our core and we will be king of the core in terms of antibodies and proteins for some time to come I think. Puneet Souda : Okay. And then last one, if I could squeeze in on Asuragen. Obviously, a very interesting asset and it appears to be Intel inside for the \u2013 some of the NIPT assays. So just getting \u2013 I wanted to get your sense on the contribution this year and sort of next year if anything you can provide there, that would be very helpful? And we expect this to be April 6 close, so I suppose it\u2019s going to add to the next quarter, too? Thank you. Jim Hippel : Yes. So Puneet, in my comments, I addressed what we thought I would add for Q4, roughly 2% to 3% revenue on top of our base \u2013 of our core business for next quarter. Minimal EBITDA contribution, they just broke into profitability, and we will provide more guidance as to what that might mean for fiscal year \u201822 as we wrap up our Q4 earnings call next quarter. Chuck Kummeth : I think what you got to remember is they are \u2013 they have got a great pipeline there, about to launch a trio of new assays along when you get the cystic fibrosis out and that \u2013 we\u2019re seeing that as a potential home run. So it\u2019s a \u2013 they have got great credibility. They are known for great quality there. In some cases, their indications are unique. In some cases, they have got competition, but we seem to be best-in-class. So stay tuned. I think as we launch these new things in their pipeline, which is really imminent over the next few months to a year, you\u2019re going to see some immediate help and support. And we\u2019re not used to buying companies that are already in the black to begin with. So this is all good. Puneet Souda : Got it. Thank you. And yes, clarifying that was more carrier screening in that versus NIPT. Thanks for the comments, Chuck. Operator : Our next question is with Jacob Johnson with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Jacob Johnson : Hi, thanks. Good morning everybody. Maybe first, just a broader question on Dan\u2019s on cell and gene therapy. Chuck, I lost count on the number of times you mentioned cell and gene therapy in your prepared comments. Can you just remind us the size of the end market across the portfolio today, what this could be in a few years? And then are you seeing more applications for this end market across your portfolio outside of things like GMP proteins, TcBuster? It seems like you are. Chuck Kummeth : Yes. You\u2019re right, Jake, we probably overdid it, but it is a pretty exciting area for us, and it starts really paying for us in a year or two out here. But right now, it\u2019s on about a $50 million run rate across all our portfolio, and that\u2019s \u2013 probably, we still are a little bit dark on just what potential is coming on with ScaleReady, but our TcBuster is really starting to land a lot of deals, starting to become significant. You already know the fabulous growth in GMP proteins, but we also have media that\u2019s really growing well as well and other things. So we see it as a $500 million plus market within 5 years for us is addressable, to be honest. And then, as we talked, we alluded to all the different synergies across the company, they are just \u2013 there is a lot of unknowns. We have put in place a \u2013 as you know, the company we designed here as a team is a subsidiary model, multinational model. We have five divisional businesses right now, six, if you want to call Asuragen one. We will probably do some synergistic work to get all the diagnostics platforms over the next year or two. But looking forward, it\u2019s going to be 6, 8, 10 different divisions. They are going to be synergistic, and we run a tech console kind of process. We make sure all these scientists are actually working together. We have a strong pipeline of new things that nobody else can do because you add platform A to platform B, we have come up with new things that nobody else can do because they don\u2019t have all the things together. This goes back to my past and a lot of other people\u2019s past in this company and to some fabulous companies we come from. Innovation rains supreme here. And I \u2013 we probably over said cell and gene therapy, but it is probably the most exciting future market for our company. We have\u2013 in terms of size, I think \u2013 I still think exosome as a platform is the biggest potential, but it\u2019s going to take years to really get all these things through because it\u2019s just so much more regulatory aligned with most of those. But we\u2019re really excited there, too. Don\u2019t be surprised in a year or two, you see ExoTRU lap prostate. I mean the ExoTRU is just \u2013 there is crazy interest in it, and we\u2019re doing really well, as you saw in our report, so... Jacob Johnson : Got it. Thanks for that. Chuck and I\u2019ve probably been called out for saying cell and gene therapy too much as well. So we\u2019re in the same camp there. And the other question, Chuck, my second one, just the last two quarters, I think you\u2019ve called out robust growth in custom products and proteins. Can you just remind us how much of proteins is custom work? And maybe just talk about the kinds of customers that demand those custom products? Chuck Kummeth : Yes. It\u2019s as much about custom antibodies. We have a custom group. It\u2019s really a great development situation for our leaders. We\u2019ve taken some of these people who worked in those areas because they are very strong technically, but they have to be very articulated with customers, etcetera. And they turn out being great businesspeople \u2013 technical businesspeople. So we\u2019ve been going into that camp. That said, it\u2019s roughly under $20 million. We don\u2019t want it too big because we got a \u2013 it\u2019s hard to scale everything. If we can get things in the catalog, it\u2019s great, but not everybody wants things in a catalog. They want them unique built for them. So we charge an awful lot to get access to our really great intellect. But it\u2019s not something that we want to make a division or see a road map to $100 million, $200 million. I think the scalability issue around our custom model because its service is difficult. If I would tap too many of our star people and I\u2019d rather have them working on products that we can sell to everybody. Jacob Johnson : Got it. Chuck Kummeth : So \u2013 but it\u2019s good. It\u2019s very profitable. It\u2019s very good. It\u2019s growing very nicely. And it\u2019s an incubator. It feeds into everything else we\u2019re doing, so... Jacob Johnson : Okay. That makes sense. I will leave it there. Congrats on the quarter. Thanks for taking the questions. Operator : Our next question is with Alex Nowak with Craig-Hallum Capital Group. Please proceed with your question. Alex Nowak : Great. Good morning everyone. Chuck, one item that didn\u2019t get any mention was the OneWeb. And as you look through the metrics there, are you seeing a big step-up, either increased traffic, increased cart sizes or just ways that research labs can put multiyear products together that fit into a solution, anything that can help explain the broad-based growth in the quarter? Chuck Kummeth : Well, here\u2019s the funny thing. We know it. You\u2019re right, we\u2019ve talked a lot about our digital presence and our investments in digital and SEO and how it\u2019s driven a lot of our growth, and it\u2019s explained a lot of our growth outside of our peers. And every time I talk too much about it, all my digital people come to me and say, you\u2019re telling all our competition way too much. And they show me data showing that some of our competitors are actually paying for AdWords on Bio-Techne. They are buying Bio-Techne\u2019s AdWords. So they are trying to creep it on our flow of customer contact. They are actually trying to lock up our own company name. So that was pretty clear to me that we\u2019re certainly got their attention, and they are trying every avenue they can to get into our model because we\u2019re taking share from everybody in our core areas, everybody. And because it\u2019s working, right? If you look at our website lately, it\u2019s phenomenal. And we just keep making it better. And the OneWeb is really \u2013 it\u2019s really an umbrella term over really a complete one-basket approach to buying. And we\u2019re not there yet, but we\u2019ve made big improvements. So you can \u2013 where instead of \u2013 you saw many things we sell. I mean we continue to have an issue of demystifying and talking about all the different potential single unicorn platforms in this company, and yet can you buy them all together on one site, you couldn\u2019t. Now more increasingly you can. And we\u2019re not going to talk as much about it going forward because it\u2019s one of our differentiators as a company. But it\u2019s going very well. It\u2019s clear by the numbers, right? So... Alex Nowak : That makes sense. Okay. And then a ton of success in ACD right now. Is there really any new innovations or research-specific projects that are propelling that business unit forward? And then I guess to take a step back there, is it fair to put ACD in a similar position as ProteinSimple was maybe 5 years ago or would you say you don\u2019t expect ACD to hit the levels that, that ProteinSimple is doing today? Chuck Kummeth : To the contrary, I think that\u2019s very prolific of you \u2013 prophetic. But there is RNAscope. There is BaseScope. There is DNAscope. There is HiPlex. There is XPlex. We\u2019ve got a hell of a portfolio coming. And all of our new extensions of our platform are higher plex strategies. So also to be aware all the HiPlex guys out there, and they know it. You don\u2019t need 0.5 million boxes with our technology. It doesn\u2019t destroy morphology. There is a lot of benefits to the \u2013 to what we have, and we have strong IP protecting it. So no, we\u2019ve always said this could be 200, 300 or more larger divisions. So it\u2019s very much at a tipping point. It\u2019s going to be knocking on $100 million next year, probably, real close, if not exceeding, and very profitable because at end of the day, it\u2019s kits, right? Great gross margins. And the team is unbelievable. They are really good in terms of cross-linking other people in the company technically and getting help and also helping them, one of the strongest technical teams I\u2019ve ever seen in my career, to be honest. And if anything, our issue is how do we keep acquiring talent in the Bay Area and keep this machine moving. It\u2019s really competitive out there for people. And that\u2019s probably the bigger concern is can we fuel the growth with more investment in key people. Jim Hippel : I\u2019d just add, Chuck, the recent launch of our DNAscope, the market for DNAscope basically doubled our addressable market from just RNAscope. Chuck Kummeth : And we\u2019ve been asked for it for you, very difficult. It\u2019s probably about a year late because it\u2019s just so technically difficult but we cracked it. Alex Nowak : No. That\u2019s great. Appreciate the update. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is with Catherine Schulte with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Catherine Schulte : Hey, guys. Congrats on the quarter, and thanks for the questions. I guess, first, in the core reagents business, your last 5-year outlook had a 5% to 7% growth rate there. Can you just talk through some of the newer growth drivers that you\u2019ve referred to earlier, whether it\u2019s mRNA or proteomics, and the potential for those to be additive as you think about that next 5-year outlook? Chuck Kummeth : Yes. And that\u2019s very astute, and it\u2019s true. I mean going back and even with us a long time, in the early days, we talked about getting into a healthy mid-single-digit growth and \u2013 because the markets aren\u2019t really growing anymore in that anyway in terms of antibodies and proteins, even assays. But it\u2019s not what\u2019s happened, right? So the markets have all improved. There is a lot more funding out there. There is a lot of halo effect of stimulus. I\u2019ve talked a couple of quarters ago about don\u2019t be too worried about a 3% NIH budget. They are probably going to come back next year with something much bigger. Sure enough, they are talking 21% starting fiscal October. It\u2019s going to be big. And this is without infectious disease. This is just oncology and neuroscience, the traditional funding from NIH. COVID is going to be another layer, and there is a halo effect of all of this. The vaccine mix, they are all buying. Everyone is exploding. There is a halo effect off of all that. And it all starts with proteins and antibodies and assays. What can I say? I think high single-digit growth at a minimum going forward, and we\u2019ve been exceeding that, as you know, we kind of look silly, because we have been double digit here for quite a few quarters, so... Catherine Schulte : Alright, great. And then maybe on ExoTRU, I can see your excitement there. Can you just talk about your commercialization strategy and building out a sales force for the launch later this calendar year and maybe the time line for Medicare coverage? Chuck Kummeth : My number one question is guidance, why don\u2019t you start with that? So it\u2019s a lot fewer barriers. We don\u2019t have to worry about 20,000 urologists. We don\u2019t have to worry about the pathologists that drive the urologists with being paid per sample off a biopsy. There is a lot of converting to do in Exosome Diagnostics. And we\u2019re doing it. We\u2019re growing and cranking. It\u2019s going to be sticky, but it\u2019s going to take some time. The ExoTRU, kidney rejection, there is only 100 centers. They are very regionally located. 85% of all the work is just in the top-tier of them. So this is why it\u2019s important to have an at-home collection potential because a lot of these patients are going to actually traveling a lot every couple of months to get these \u2013 to get their new kidney checked, and now they don\u2019t have to. Now they can send in urine. It\u2019s simple. So we don\u2019t have a big commercial plan. It\u2019s going to be like a key account model. There is going to be a half a dozen different reps. We will probably hire some heavy hitters that are well-known in the industry and go to work. So \u2013 and right now, we got some good news, right? I mean we got MolDX offering up via \u2013 being CareDx as a solution. There is a lot more, I guess, acceptance of the LDT just in general for this issue of kidney rejection. And if we can get our \u2013 if we get NGS to abide by this opening, it\u2019s going to actually accelerate our process, all this process. So we don\u2019t know yet, but we\u2019re talking to NGS, and they have been very supportive so far and very open and they are very, very interested. They like the data. They like the publication we\u2019ve done already. And I\u2019m hoping and expecting this will be a much smoother commercial transition than ExoDx was for prostate, to be honest. Jim Hippel : As most transplant patients are covered by Medicare, you don\u2019t have to worry about trying to convert a bunch of private payers. Chuck Kummeth : Yes. 85%. So that\u2019s another nice thing. Catherine Schulte : Yes, okay. And then last one for me, maybe on the Xencor agreement, how should we think about the time line for those antibodies, then move to clinicals and potential magnitude of milestones for those agreements? Chuck Kummeth : Yes. Well, it\u2019s unknown. As you know, working with therapeutic companies, you \u2013 they won\u2019t tell you everything anyway. But we\u2019re on our third different antibody. They are well along in the first one. I don\u2019t know. All I know is that it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re getting paid upfront. We\u2019re getting paid milestones. We get royalties. We hope that they are successful with their clinicals. But we don\u2019t have their schedule for clinicals or what\u2019s going on, but it certainly won\u2019t be 6 months or a year or two, not sure, to see much come back from that beyond the milestone payments and everything else, but we have got a list. I mean we are \u2013 we have got quite a few of these going out. And it\u2019s not $10,000, $20,000 here. We\u2019re talking bigger \u2013 much bigger numbers upfront just to get access to our technology whenever you have to do that. And that\u2019s becoming a nice new layer of new reps, as we mentioned. Catherine Schulte : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question is with Patrick Donnelly from Citi. Please proceed with your question. Patrick Donnelly : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Chuck, maybe just on ExoDx, obviously, you got a nice payer on board, I think, in the beginning of April. I know you\u2019ve talked often about maybe if you get a big one, it\u2019ll be the first of a few dominoes to fall relatively quickly. Can you just talk about the conversation pace since then with payers and what we should expect over the next couple of quarters and the flow there? Chuck Kummeth : Yes. It\u2019s certainly accelerating. We have much more \u2013 many more of the satellite Blue Cross Blue Shields now in the final throes of contracting with us. And of course, we\u2019re still going after United and all other big ones. And it\u2019s always \u2013 it always starts like this. One of the big ones has to go. And then eventually, the other one is not going to be left behind. And it gets to a point where patients are demanding it, right? So it\u2019s going to happen. It\u2019s way too good at technology. It works way too well, and we\u2019re just going to keep grinding away at it. And it\u2019s just too bad that this is a patient set that just aren\u2019t leaving their homes and going to see their urologists and getting checkups. But they are coming back now, and our numbers are improving dramatically, as we mentioned, in March, for sure. And we\u2019re getting there. I mean I think all in, from the beginning, we\u2019re well north of 50,000 tests administered. So we\u2019re \u2013 this is not \u2013 this is getting more than being a secret. So we\u2019re getting there. Patrick Donnelly : Right, okay. And then on the COVID side, I know you talked about a few different product lines that played into the mRNA vaccines. Are you able to quantify what the impact was in the quarter, even at a high level would be helpful? Chuck Kummeth : Well, we had \u2013 as I mentioned, we had 90% growth, and some of that growth is mRNA. It\u2019s vaccine related. I don\u2019t even have a number in front of me. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s half or anything, but it\u2019s just the component of the growth on all fronts, so... Patrick Donnelly : Okay. And then maybe last one, just on a geographic basis. China has been a source of strength for much of the group here. Can you just talk through your performance there and then the outlook? Certainly, seems like things are moving up. Chuck Kummeth : Well, as you remember, China fell off the table first, so they have the easiest comp, so 50% here being the number, and they are back strong, and the momentum is good. So we\u2019re kind of back on track, level it all out or looking back a year or 2 where it\u2019s a 25% grower, so at least 2022. We\u2019re pushing them for \u201825, and I think that\u2019s going to happen. We fared better than most last year in China where we still grew into single-digit growth as opposed to the typical 20% plus. So we had an easy comp for China, but not an easy comp compared to much of our competition in China. Patrick Donnelly : Understood. Thanks, Chuck. Chuck Kummeth : And we\u2019ve been hiring there. The group is expanding. It\u2019s kind of business as usual in China, to be honest, except for some of our management trying to get in to help. Basically, going through quarantine, it\u2019s tough. And then there aren\u2019t any Chinese extended visas yet. So you can only go in for 2 months and they kick you back out and you got to start over again. So no visits for a while for any of us. Patrick Donnelly : Right. Thanks, Chuck. Operator : Our next question is with Paul Knight from Janney Montgomery Scott. Please proceed with your question. Paul Knight : Hi, Chuck, you\u2019ve emphasized how your catalog is the very best in a long time for any threat to it. Is it the annotation now that you have around it along with the content? How would you describe the barriers to your catalog now? Chuck Kummeth : There really aren\u2019t. I mean in the beginning \u2013 and you\u2019re pretty up on this, I know, Paul, but IL-2 is kind of the first thing being sold. It\u2019s probably still a leading protein being sold, and we make that as well. But we\u2019re in the IL-7, IL-10, IL-15, and there is more. There is others. We have a catalog of roughly 50. Our competition is half to less than that. I\u2019m just saying we have a strong catalog. We are not the largest GMP protein provider yet, but we will be. Paul Knight : Right. And the... Chuck Kummeth : We kind of have to wait and see where these guys go with the process and the next spec and their next clinical. Are they looking for IL-27 or IL-37 or whatever? We have all the hardest to make proteins from research to kind of lead the way for the whole world following on what proteins come about when. How many of these become asked for or put in a GMP format is unknown. And to be honest, we will probably have to work with them. They\u2019ll have to use us more than they have been if they want to understand the benefits of an advanced new protein that they don\u2019t really understand or don\u2019t know about because we will always have the most early information in the world on a new protein. Paul Knight : Is that also the profile of your St. Paul customer? Is it a technical product? What are they finding in your facility to book capacity? Chuck Kummeth : Well, right now, it\u2019s all about qualification. They want to see that \u2013 they know our R&D Systems brand is a high-quality protein. They want to see, instead of a couple of hundred thousand dollars of purchases for research needs, then they get $10 million of it at the same quality level, large lot, consistency and lot. And all the paperwork that has to go with it for being GMP, right, because it\u2019s regulated. So they are coming and do audits and all that. It\u2019s not really about checking us out if we can make the protein or not. They kind of get that. It\u2019s more about all everything else. Can you make enough of it? Is it consistent? Have we done all the GMP regulatory stuff correctly? Do we have the bandwidth of the teams in place, the leadership? The typical audit stuff and it\u2019s gone very well. And when you guys can start traveling again, you \u2013 we will bring tours. It\u2019s a deal close a facility. It\u2019s amazing. Paul Knight : Yes. And then lastly, there has been a lot of M&A in the industry with diagnostics assets. Are \u2013 is the pipeline \u2013 are the candidates out there much more attractive than they used to be due to maturity of the industry? What\u2019s behind your M&A? What do you think is behind the activity in the industry? Chuck Kummeth : Well, I think the growth for the industry is driving the activity. And now we\u2019re going to have a bunch of very difficult comps, and a lot of companies with work chest of COVID cash, and so it\u2019s going to drive a lot of M&A, I think, starting probably now, but certainly being the next fall. I mean start doing the math and what the big guys are now interested to have cash than anything. And they are not going to want to shrink that. They are going to want to grow. So they are going more M&A. If it turns out, we will be in there swinging like we always have. We\u2019re not trying to compete with Thermo or Danaher. And Asuragen is a perfect example of yet another private deal we did, getting a great team, a bolt-on energy is in place and we will be able to grow much better with them than they would be on their own. We have certainly come in second and third on a few of the past year, some staying. I really wanted them, but we\u2019re not going to overpay. And things are pricey right now. It\u2019s just because that\u2019s the industry we\u2019re in, and people are demanding innovation and growth, and they can\u2019t do it. It\u2019s just classic make versus buy in the end, I guess. But it\u2019s driving valuations. And the growth we\u2019re seeing in our company \u2013 and we\u2019re not the only one, right? It\u2019s driving valuations as well. Paul Knight : Yes. Okay, thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I would like to turn the call back over to Chuck Kummeth for closing remarks. Chuck Kummeth : Alright. Well, thank you, Maria. It was a great quarter. What\u2019s not to like with a 25-year record. So as you guys all know, Q4 should be even maybe more fun to talk about and I look forward to next quarter when we\u2019re all together again. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning and welcome to the Bio-Techne Earnings Conference Call for the Fourth Quarter of Fiscal Year 2021. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to David Clair, Bio-Techne\u2019s Senior Director, Investor Relations and Corporate Development. Please go ahead, sir. David Clair : Good morning and thank you for joining us. On the call with me this morning are Chuck Kummeth, Chief Executive Officer and Jim Hippel, Chief Financial Officer of Bio-Techne. Before we begin, let me briefly cover our Safe Harbor statement. Some of the comments made during this conference call maybe considered forward-looking statements, including beliefs and expectations about the company\u2019s future results as well as the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and financial results. The company\u2019s 10-K for fiscal year 2020 identifies certain factors that could cause the company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements made during this call. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of any new information or future events or developments. The 10-K as well as the company\u2019s other SEC filings are available on the company\u2019s website within its Investor Relations section. During the call, non-GAAP financial measures maybe used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. Tables reconciling these measures to most comparable GAAP measures are available in the company\u2019s press release issued earlier this morning on the Bio-Techne Corporation website at www.bio-techne.com. I will now turn the call over to Chuck. Chuck Kummeth : Thanks, Dave and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter conference call. With 39% organic growth in the quarter, the fourth quarter closed out a record year for Bio-Techne, where we achieved 22% organic growth for the full 2021 fiscal year. What a difference a year makes. We ended fiscal 2020 on a much different note, as lockdowns and disruptions to our academic and biopharma customers took hold and changed the way research was being conducted. In the quarter following the initial COVID pandemic spread, there has been a record level of interest in Bio-Techne\u2019s portfolio of reagents, analytical tools and services that enable researchers to make discoveries and push science forward. With robust research demand from biopharma end markets and expectations for a favorable government research funding environment, we believe a multiyear research tsunami is upon us. Bio-Techne is incredibly well-positioned to ride this wave. For the second quarter in a row, the Q4 growth rate was the best organic growth the company has delivered over 25 years, both on a year-over-year and over a 2-year CAGR basis. The accelerated Q4 growth was broad-based across our end markets and geographies, although most of our customers experienced the worst of the pandemic-induced lockdowns during our fiscal Q4 last year. The growth within our product category was also broad-based and continue to be led by our analytical instrument platforms, cell and gene therapy solutions and genomics tissue spatial analysis tools. EMEA had a strong finish to a record year with 25% organic growth for the full fiscal year. Given that our main distribution hub for Europe is in the UK, Brexit was quite a distraction with multiple supply chain and logistics surprises to conquer between the UK and Mainland Europe. The team did an excellent job navigating through this and ensuring the strong demand from our European customers was delivered. China is a similar story. As you may recall, China was the first to lockdown due to COVID and the first to come out. But China for us is essentially back to business by our fiscal Q4 of last year. So the year-over-year comps for China were tough this year compared to the U.S. and EMEA. Yet China delivered 30% growth for the quarter and the full fiscal year. We are very close to seeing $100 million of annual revenue in China if not this coming fiscal year, most certainly the year after. Across the company, we delivered this record quarter with a continued focus on profitability as our operating margin expanded by over 740 basis points year-over-year. And during the quarter, we made progress investing in the human capital necessary to position the company for its next leg of growth, although demand for talent in the life science industry remains very high. Encouragingly, some of the business practices we took for granted in the pre-pandemic world, including business travel, are slowly returning, but remain below normal levels. Consistent with our results throughout fiscal 2021, the deferral of these investments accelerated our profitability. Now, let\u2019s discuss the performance of our growth platform, starting with the Protein Sciences segment, where organic growth accelerated to 46% in the quarter and 24% for the full fiscal year. During the year, we made great progress with our cell and gene therapy initiatives. We opened our GMP protein facility and signed several large customers. Going forward, we will continue to broaden our GMP portfolio with the planned introduction of GMP-grade recombinant antibodies, cell and expansion media and other critical reagents. The demand for GMP proteins is likely to expand beyond T cell-based therapies to include gene-edited natural killer cells and progenitor cells that fill the regenerative medicine therapies workflow. All of these areas are gaining momentum and increasingly relying on our products. As evidence of this growing interest, Catamaran Bio and Bio-Techne recently broadened the scope of their collaboration to include the development of novel cell expansion technologies for use in the manufacture CAR-NK cell therapy products. Additionally, Catamaran secured a broad worldwide license for TcBuster, our gene editing platform, and has integrated the technology into its tailwind platform for CAR-NK cell therapies. Importantly, our cell and gene therapy relationships, such as this example, are having a broader impact throughout the company, driving adoption of our media, assays, instrumentation, antibodies and other offerings in our portfolio. We are leveraging our digital marketing capabilities to build awareness and the customer funnel for our expanding portfolio of cell and gene therapy workflow solutions. During the quarter, we made enhancements to our website, including promotional videos and additional images to more effectively showcase our complete offering. I would encourage all of you to visit the cell and gene Therapy section of Bio-Techne\u2019s website to view a video providing a virtual tour of our state-of-the-art GMP protein facility. Now let\u2019s discuss the analytical instruments we sell within the Protein Sciences segment. If you would have asked me in the past, if we could grow our three main platforms : Simple Western, Jess, Simple Plex, Ella and Biologics Maurice by 30% to 80% all year long, I would have said impossible. What happened this past year, a number of things. First, these instruments are great tools for productivity. If labs redesign themselves around working partially from home, it became more important to increase output while in the lab. Our tools are perfect for this and add a great value. Second, proteomics-based applications are on fire. Research in this area is strong, and our tools are not only the best in class, and in some cases, the only type of tool you can purchase that conducts a specific analysis. For example, Simple Western is the only fully automated Western blot solution on the market. The productivity enabled by our Simple Western instrument combined with our growing installed base has led to a significant increase in market awareness for this product. In fact, we believe this awareness has reached a critical tipping point as almost 90% of the Simple Western instruments sold in the quarter did not require a demo. Simple Plex continued its streak amazing results in Q4 and with our automated multiplexing platform, Ella, delivering over 65% growth in the quarter as demand for neurology, immunotherapy and cell and gene therapy research applications drove instruments placements and utilization within the installed base. This result is even more impressive considering the particularly challenging year-over-year comp Ella faced when high demand for the system for COVID-related applications drove an almost 100% increase in the same quarter last year. We took several steps to meet ongoing demand for this platform, including additional shifts and are in the initial stages of adding incremental manufacturing capacity to meet forecasted demand. During this quarter, we announced the collaboration with India-based ophthalmic healthcare provider, Narayana Nethralaya, for the evaluation of Ella as a diagnostic tool for to analyze LASIK vision correction patients for post surgery complications. This is another example of the untapped potential of Ella as a clinical diagnostic platform. We also recently announced collaboration with ProGen for the launch of the Simple Plex adeno-associated virus, or AAV2, viral titer assay on our Ella platform. AAV2 is commonly used in gene transduction due to its ability to infect a variety of cell types. During the viral vector production process, a series of robust analytical measurements are required to determine the viral titer. Combining the efficiency and the reproducibility of the established AAV2 ELISA from the ProGen with the convenient workflow and robust performance of the Ella platform creates an assay with a broad dynamic range along with hands-free automation to accelerate cell and gene therapy quality control process. Our biologics portfolio also had a very strong showing with growth over 30% for the quarter and the year. We are excited about the recently announced collaboration with 908 Devices, where our Maurice Biologics platform provides reproducible quantitative analysis of identity, purity and heterogeneity profiles for therapeutic proteins will be paired with the 908 Devices ZipChip. For the collaboration, Maurice will enable the measurement of molecules that have a similar charge or isoform and collect tractions of these isoforms for purification and the preparation on the ZipChip prior to being introduced to a mass spectrometer creating a seamless sample prep workflow. Finally, our core portfolio of proteomic research reagents increased over 50% for the quarter and nearly 20% for the fiscal year. During the fiscal year, we expanded our market-leading portfolio of research reagents, including the addition of over 300 new research proteins to our expanding catalog of over 6,000 proteins. For antibodies, biopharma is increasingly recognizing our capabilities in immunooncology targets and immune cell labeling. Now, let\u2019s discuss our Genomics and Diagnostics segment, where the team delivered 22% organic growth in the quarter and 18% for the full fiscal year. Our spatial genomics and tissue pathology business branded ACD, remained extremely strong with the team delivering over 60% growth in the quarter. Growth was broad-based within the portfolio and across geographies with RNA scope remaining strong and the emerging high-plex BaseScope and microRNA products all gaining traction as new marketing campaigns and deeper account penetration benefited the business. We fortified our RNA scope offering with the introduction of the latest version of our multiplexing spatial genomic technology, HiPlex v2. This latest iteration of HiPlex adds the ability to visualize that the 12 targets simultaneously in our formalin-fixed paraffin embedded or FFPE samples and continues to offer the flexing of up to 48 targets in fresh or freshly frozen tissue samples available in the legacy version of the assay. FFPE is an important sample type for human samples, especially for studying diseases. And we anticipate demand for HiPlex v2 as a tool for cancer and neuroscience applications as well as immunooncology studies. Next, our diagnostic reagents business faced large headwinds this past year with the pandemic dramatically reducing doctor visits and in turn, diagnostic controls to OEM customers. However, this business successfully overcame these headwinds by supplying COVID-related antibodies to COVID-related test and vaccine manufacturing, realizing eight consecutive quarters of positive growth. With people returning to see their doctor again in a post-vaccinated world, future is bright for our diagnostic reagents business with a strong product and OEM pipeline. Our Exosome Diagnostics business unit continues to make progress despite a very soft urology market. During COVID, patients were not leaving the home to do annual checkups or seeing their urologists. This dramatically reduced their level of PSA test. The tool used by urologists to identify a need to prescribe an ExoDx test for prostate cancer risk analysis and possible biopsy. The market is now recovering. We have staffed up our commercial sales force and our growth is accelerating. We also made progress on the EPI reimbursement front during the quarter, following our request for reconsideration, our Medicare administrative contractor, National Government Services, or NGS, issued an updated ExoDx prostate local coverage decision, or LCD. This updated LCD removed many of the ExoDx prostate restrictions included in the original LCD including limitations for test utilization among certain necessities, excluding patients with first degree relative with prostate cancer as well as removing the restrictions for patients with a persistently elevated PSA score. The reconsidered LCD became effective on August 1st. Following the removal of these EPI usage restrictions, the LCD better reflects the NCCN guidelines and positions the test for improved utilization among the Medicare population. In addition to the ExoDx prostate test, we continue to advance our pipeline of innovative exosome-based diagnostic tests including our noninvasive kidney transplant rejection assay, ExoTRU. As a reminder, our initial ExoTRU data was published earlier this year in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, showing a negative predictive value of 93.3% and a positive predictive value of 86.2%, which we view as best-in-class performance versus the competition. We remain on track to launch this noninvasive urine-based assay later in calendar 2021 and have held preliminary discussions with our MAC on the pathway for Medicare reimbursement. Finally, I\u2019d like to highlight the acquisition of Asuragen we made this past quarter, a 15-year-old diagnostics company with strong competencies, great leadership and domain knowledge and diagnostic regulations. They also bring kitting expertise, molecular oncology diagnostic kits as well as a strong portfolio of carrier screening diagnostics like Fragile X the world\u2019s best-in-class test for identifying prenatal intellectual disabilities. During the quarter, Asuragen published the results of a multi-site evaluation study known as AmplideX, PCR SMA Plus kit in the Journal of Molecular Diagnostics, validating its performance in delivering accurate, reliable information to support carrier identification for the diagnosis of spinal and muscular atrophy or SMA. Asuragen\u2019s kit simplifies existing methods for identifying relevant variance in the SMN1 and SMN2 genes by identifying all variants in a single reaction. I want to be clear on our direction for diagnostics. It is not our goal to be simply a CLIA lab service model. We prefer to sell kitted products, primarily in the oncology, neuroscience and prenatal markets. These markets have strong growth due to strong needs as well as good margins and better-than-average reimbursement levels. Since closing the acquisition on April 6, we have made significant progress with the integration efforts with Asuragen and are in the initial stages of building out the commercial team to increase penetration in the largely untapped EMEA market. We have also begun a coordinated R&D and marketing strategy to identify synergistic projects across the company, especially with Exosome Diagnostics as we position our entire diagnostic offering to penetrate high-value markets with kitted and LDT assays. Lastly, I\u2019d like to give an update on the impact of our COVID-19 initiatives. Since the start of the pandemic, Bio-Techne\u2019s reagents and instruments have facilitated studies that allow a better understanding of the virus, including ACD probe\u2019s detected virus and tissue, sales of bulk diagnostic reagent shields and COVID testing applications as well as pathogen-specific antibodies and proteins to known variants of the COVID virus. COVID was an estimated 3% tailwind to our business in Q4 and approximately 4% tailwind for the year, including revenue from sales of the Kantaro IgG antibody serology kit. Encouragingly, there is growing interest in niche markets forming around our COVID serology assay offering, specifically as a tool to identify immunocompromised individuals that may not have the antibody response following vaccination to neutralize the virus. We expect the COVID research and diagnostics will be around for many years, particularly as new viral strains continue to emerge, making this tailwind a sustainable new layer of our product portfolio going forward. Wrapping up, we have reached the tipping point in several of our high-growth businesses, including the ACD Spatial Genomics business and our ProteinSimple branded portfolio of proteomic analytical tools and remain in the early innings of penetrating the nascent cell and gene therapy and liquid biopsy markets that are in the front of the company. Layered on to this is a strong funding environment for our market-leading catalog of research proteins and antibodies and the scientific know-how that has been built around them for over the last 40 years, and I believe we are incredibly well positioned to remain one of the most innovative, high-growth, highly profitable life science tools and diagnostic companies going forward. We are closing in on an important milestone crossing $1 billion in annual revenue. And with our existing portfolio, see a pathway to double that in the years to come. On that note, I want to remind everyone that Bio-Techne will be hosting an Investor Day event on September 10 in New York City. At the meeting, we plan to dive deeper into all our growth drivers and provide an update on our long-term aspirations. We hope to see everyone there. With that, I will hand over to Jim. Jim Hippel : Thanks, Chuck. I\u2019ll provide an overview of our Q4 fiscal \u201821 financial performance for the total company, provide some additional details on the performance of each of our segments and give some thoughts on the year ahead. Given the anomaly that occurred in Q4 last year with the pandemic-induced customer lockdowns, I will also provide certain growth rates expressed as 2-year CAGRs as these are likely more representative of our midterm underlying growth momentum. Starting with the overall fourth quarter financial performance, adjusted EPS was $1.87 versus $1 a year ago, an increase of 87% over last year, representing a new company record. Foreign exchange positively impacted EPS by $0.08. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.37 compared to $1.48 in the prior year. The biggest driver for the decrease in GAAP EPS was unrealized losses on our investment in ChemoCentryx this year compared to unrealized ChemoCentryx gains in the prior year. Q4 revenue was $259 million, an increase of 47% year-over-year on a reported basis, 39% on an organic basis and an organic CAGR of approximately 13% since Q4 of \u201819. Foreign exchange translation had a favorable 4% year-over-year impact and acquisitions also had a favorable 4% impact to revenue growth. For the fiscal year \u201821, revenue was $931 million, an increase of 26% on a reported basis, 22% on an organic basis and an organic CAGR of approximately 13% since fiscal year \u201819. Foreign exchange translation and acquisitions had a favorable year-over-year impact of 3% and 1%, respectively. All geographies had a strong growth in Q4, led by the U.S. growing nearly 60%, which represents a 13% CAGR since Q4 fiscal year \u201819, followed by EMEA with over 35% growth or a 2-year CAGR of 15%, and in China with growth north of 30% for the quarter, representing a 2-year CAGR in the high 20s. The rest of the world grew almost 30% or at a 10% 2-year CAGR. Q4 of last year was the start of pandemic in the U.S., with shutdown severely impacting this geography, while European customers have begun to emerge in the shutdowns and China was largely reopened in Q4 for fiscal year \u201820. Hence, the comps in Q4 this year were easier in the U.S. compared to China and Europe. That being said, the 2-year CAGRs across the globe are impressive and illustrate that we\u2019ve emerged a pandemic even stronger than before it started. By end market, biopharma continues to be very strong, growing nearly 50%, while academia growth was impacted by the shutdowns \u2013 was most impacted by the shutdowns last year, growing nearly 60%. The 2-year CAGR, we believe, illustrates the real relative strength with biopharma growth nearly 20% and academic growing approximately 5% per annum over this period. We expect academia to continue to improve as national funding budgets get approved and dispersed throughout the next year. Moving on to the details of the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin was 72.5% in the quarter compared to 69.5% in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by volume leverage, operational productivity and favorable product mix. Adjusted SG&A in Q4 was 26.1% of revenue, a 200 basis point decrease compared to the prior year, and R&D expense in Q4 was 8% of revenue, 150 basis points lower than last year. While adjusted SG&A and R&D spend both increased sequentially and compared to the prior year, a tight life science labor market did not allow us to fill all planned headcount additions to the team at the pace we had originally anticipated, especially in the more scientific and engineering fields. However, our pace of hiring did increase over the course of Q4, and we plan to make additional progress in fiscal 2022. This investment in critical human capital will position the company for growth going forward. Additionally, Q4 was the first quarter that included a surgeon\u2019s operating costs. The resulting adjusted operating margin for Q4 was 38.5%, an increase of 740 basis points from the prior year and a 340 basis point improvement from Q4 of fiscal \u201819. For the full fiscal year \u201821, adjusted operating margin was 38.9%, an increase of 560 basis points from fiscal year \u201820 and a 470 basis point improvement from fiscal year \u201819. Looking at our numbers below operating income, net interest expense in Q4 was $3 million, decreasing $1.4 million compared to the prior year period. The decrease was due to a continued reduction of our bank debt during fiscal 2021 as well as lower floating rates. Our bank debt on the balance sheet as of the end of Q4 stood at $341.3 million. Other adjusted non-operating expense was $0.7 million for the quarter compared to $0.5 million of income in the prior year, primarily reflecting the foreign exchange impact related to our cash point arrangements. For GAAP reporting, other non-operating income includes unrealized losses from our investment in ChemoCentryx. Moving further down the P&L, our adjusted effective tax rate in Q4 was 20.3%, a 110 basis point improvement over the prior year, with the improvement primarily driven by geographic mix. Note that the GAAP effective tax rate in Q4 was favorably impacted by the discrete timing of stock option exercises. As a reminder, during Q2, we made a strategic investment in China-based Eminence, a company focused on providing media as well as custom cell line development and media formulation services, the Chinese biopharmaceutical market. The $316,000 non-controlling interest line item reflects a loss on a portion of Eminence we do not own. The impact to other lines of the P&L as a result of consolidating Eminence was immaterial in Q4. Turning to cash flow and return of capital, a $122 million of cash was generated from operations in the quarter, more than 170% increase over the prior year. The increase was driven by strong working capital management while meeting our customer commitments on much higher demand. In Q4, our net investment in capital expenditures was $12.8 million. And during Q4, we returned capital to shareholders by way of $12.4 million in dividends. We finished Q4 with 41 million average diluted shares outstanding. Our balance sheet finished Q4 in a very strong position with $231.6 million in cash and short-term available for sale investments and a total leverage ratio of well under 1x EBITDA. Next, I will discuss the performance of our reporting segments, starting with the Protein Sciences segment. Q4 reported sales were $192.3 million, with reported revenue increasing 51% compared to the prior year. Organic growth was 46% with foreign exchange having a favorable impact of 5%. The organic CAGR since fourth quarter of fiscal \u201819 was approximately 14% per annum. Within this segment, the strong growth was very broad-based in nearly all reagent, assay and instrument platforms. Looking at 2-year CAGRs going back to fourth quarter of fiscal year \u201819, standouts in the group would be Simple Plex with approximately 75% annual growth, cell and gene therapy with approximately 50% annual growth, with the GMP protein component growing well over 100% annually. Biologics was approximately 25% annual growth and Simple Western with approximately 20% annual growth. Operating margin for the Protein Sciences segment was 46.7%, an increase of 780 basis points year-over-year, due primarily to favorable volume leverage, operational productivity and cost management. Turning to the Diagnostics and Genomics segment, Q4 reported sales were $67.1 million, with reported revenue increasing 38%. Organic growth for this segment was 22% with acquisitions contributing 15% and foreign exchange translation having a favorable 1% impact on revenue. The organic CAGR since the fourth quarter of fiscal year \u201819 was approximately 11% per annum. The ACD-branded spatial analysis portfolio, together with the Exosome Diagnostics, led the segment in the quarter with 2-year CAGRs of nearly 20% and 70% per annum, respectively. As Chuck mentioned earlier, our Diagnostics Reagents business did a very nice job executing on both COVID-related antibody opportunities to cover for the softness in the general diagnostics market, resulting in a mid single-digit CAGR over the last 2 years since the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201819. Moving on to the Diagnostics and Genomics segment operating margin at 16.7%, the segment\u2019s operating margin improved 430 basis points compared to the prior year. The increase also reflects strong volume leverage, operational productivity and strong cost management across the segment. In summary, we finished fiscal \u201821 on a very strong note. Our products are clearly addressing the current needs of the research and clinical communities we serve, providing the proteomic, genomic and diagnostic tools necessary to drive science forward. With some of the largest opportunities still in front of the company, we believe we are just getting started and are looking forward to updating everyone on our vision for the future during our upcoming Investor Day. In the more near term, with favorable life science research funding as a tailwind, we expect the organic growth momentum that we\u2019ve experienced over the last 2 years to carry on into fiscal year \u201822. We foresee continued strength across our entire portfolio. With cell and gene therapy, our analytical instrument portfolio and spatial genomic analysis tools, leading the way once again, while 4 reagents maintained their market leadership position and the Exosome Diagnostic prostate test continues to ramp. We also anticipate Asuragen to add approximately 3% growth to our top line during fiscal year \u201822 and begin to be accretive to our organic growth in the fourth quarter. As Chuck and I mentioned in our prior commentary, we have recently made progress in making the investments needed to support our future growth, but have further to go to catch up to our strategic plan and enable the acceleration of growth in the future. Additionally, with our biopharma and academic customers now back to work, increasingly more receptive to in-person interaction, we are expecting a return of pre-pandemic activities, including corporate travel to normalize as fiscal year \u201822 progresses. Finally, Asuragen is still in the initial stages of profitability and making the investments necessary to fully realize the synergies and global potential of this business. All these considerations taken together, we expect our adjusted operating margin going forward to be sequentially lower compared to our Q4 fiscal \u201821 results, but returning back to this level in the back half of fiscal year \u201822. That concludes my prepared comments. And with that, I will turn the call back over to open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Dan Arias with Stifel. Dan Arias : Good mornig, guys. Thanks for the question. Jim, I appreciate the color there on the business, did I hear you give an organic growth guidance number for the year for 2022? Jim Hippel : What you heard me say was that our CAGR for the past 2 years has been approximately 13% and we expect that kind of momentum to continue into fiscal year \u201822. Chuck Kummeth : We always give it. Dan Arias : Okay, obviously, a lot of room for interpretation or just a range of outcomes for double-digits or just expecting the CAGR to continue. Is there anyway you could comment just on maybe where the Street is? The Street is looking for, I think right around 15%. I hear what you are saying on 13% is the fair assumption that something... Chuck Kummeth : Yes. We will have more commentary at the Investor Day. And we will get into more specifics and kind of break down where things are at. But right now, it\u2019s kind of hard. And we typically \u2013 we don\u2019t give guidance. We give target ranges. And we went many years talking about 10 to 12 and numbers like that and stuff. We\u2019re certainly at 13ish right now, and it could be much higher, and we certainly are over a 5-year target, a range we\u2019re guiding higher than that and to reach our stated goal as it has to be, but we\u2019re very bullish right now. It\u2019s just kind of hard to put too much more than that. But by September, we will. I mean it\u2019s a good story, but as Jim said, the momentum continues. We don\u2019t see anything changing. And since we\u2019ve been beating quarter after quarter, maybe that\u2019s a good sign. Dan Arias : Yes, that\u2019s true. Okay. Maybe just a high level question, I mean, obviously, you guys have a portfolio that\u2019s pretty well-positioned in a bunch of areas and you\u2019re growing in certain areas and you\u2019re expanding capacity in certain areas. Are we \u2013 are you able to sort of parse out for us where in the business or what portion of the business you think growth is most likely to be limited by just your own capacity or you\u2019re still ramping capabilities versus what the customer base might bring in terms of demand? Chuck Kummeth : Well, first, I comment \u2013 it\u2019s one thing to grow double digits and deal with which you need to expand because nobody does expansion for ways to double your business very quickly. You go in increments, so it makes sense. You don\u2019t want to have your facilities empty. It\u2019s a competitive world, right? You start growing at 20% plus and the kind of growth rate you\u2019re seeing and you get kind of caught. On top of that with the shortage and talent is just the whole economy or life sciences kind of kind of booming right now, funding looking good. It\u2019s kind of a race. So we\u2019re kind of \u2013 we\u2019re expanding and kind of ahead of it for now, looking for continued and accelerated growth per our last discussion here. And to be frank, we\u2019re virtually expanding every business we have. We don\u2019t have a single thing we\u2019re doing that we\u2019re not behind and don\u2019t need to expand and invest in. They are all doing great. We also are not behind to your question, we can meet. I think we\u2019re there in time. We have the capital, we have the talent, we have the consultants, we have the land, and we have the buildings. We have the supply chain figured off what we need for instantiation, but we don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to get caught behind and throttle in any business that we have. Last year, the one that\u2019s been the toughest has been Simple Plex, right? We have been... Dan Arias : Yes, that\u2019s what I was going to talk about. Chuck Kummeth : Certainly a little under that. But 65% growth on top of 100% a year earlier, that\u2019s phenomenal. Now that one, we\u2019re going to pretty much blow it out with the new building, new everything this year, and we will be online in a year. So I don\u2019t predict that we will be able to not ship every order that we have, to be honest. Dan Arias : Okay. Appreciate it. Thank you. Chuck Kummeth : And that growth rate will take only over 13% on that one. Operator : Thank you. We take our next question from Jacob Johnson with Stephens. Jacob Johnson : Hi, just one quick follow-up, not to belabor the \u201822 outlook. The 13% growth number you referenced, Jim, that\u2019s an organic figure and you expect that momentum to continue plus Asuragen is about a 3% inorganic benefit. Is that kind of the way to think about it? Jim Hippel : That is correct. Jacob Johnson : Okay, perfect. And maybe for Chuck, following up on your comment on Simple Plex, you seem to be finding more and more uses for Ella. I think I heard you mention neurology. And I think your competitors talking about the opportunity for the use of their instrument and screening and testing for Alzheimer\u2019s drugs. Is that maybe an opportunity you could find for Ella? Chuck Kummeth : Yes, absolutely. It\u2019s fast. It\u2019s microfluidic. It has incredible sensitivity. So yes, we\u2019re definitely involved in those kinds of applications. It\u2019s a biomarker discovery tool for therapy creation, for drug discovery. It\u2019s primarily what\u2019s used for. And now we\u2019re \u2013 it\u2019s morphing into all these possible clinical applications too, which we\u2019re working on, as you know. So probably the biggest sleeper we have there. It\u2019s probably the biggest sleeper we have at really identifying all the different addressable markets and potential things we can do with it. So that\u2019s why you see the growth rates you see with it. It\u2019s just kind of off the charts. Jacob Johnson : Got it. If I can just squeeze one more in, just, Chuck, on the expansion in the GMP median antibodies. Is that something you\u2019ll implement at your existing GMP facility or is this something that requires additional capacity? And two, is this something that is contemplated kind of in the $140 million of capacity you brought online for proteins or is this something that\u2019s added into that opportunity? Chuck Kummeth : No, it\u2019s all the same discussion. We have the capability of doing a roughly $40 million in revenue at headquarters. It just would be in smaller lots. We\u2019re GMP here, but it\u2019s primarily research. So therefore, we built the new facility which is open now, and we\u2019re going to get started selling out of inventory, qualified lots here in the coming months here. And that is $140 million to $200 million in capacity depending on which product mix you have. It\u2019s further expandable very quickly within 6 months inside the current building, which we haven\u2019t used out space yet or on site as well, so\u2026 Jacob Johnson : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Operator : Thank you. We take our next question from Catherine Schulte with Baird. Catherine Schulte : Hi guys. Congrats on the quarter and thanks for the question. I guess, first, in your core Reagent Solutions Division, just curious what you\u2019re seeing in terms of lab activity levels, how has the reopening varied by geography? And do you think there is still improvements to be had out there? Chuck Kummeth : Well, as we mentioned last quarter, kind of probably near the end of the quarter, but it became apparent that we\u2019re probably back to full strength. I think there is confusion over just because people aren\u2019t in the lab and maybe doing their analytics and their math and their paper writing at home, it doesn\u2019t mean they are not bad. Their experiments are ongoing and they are being productive in the labs. And so we think we\u2019re academically kind of back to full strength. They are just working differently. They are working smarter. They are being a little more biopharma like. And that would be a comment for both U.S. and Europe. China is full on, has been for quarters. And we\u2019re into the next 5-year funding cycle in China. And the first year, we\u2019re actually going into the second year at pretty soon, and that\u2019s usually a big ramp year for China. Catherine Schulte : Alright. Got it. And I was curious if you could just talk through M&A priority areas. You\u2019ve done a lot on the diagnostic side and cell and gene therapy over the last couple of years. And you mentioned in your prepared remarks about proteomics being on fire from a research application area. Are there applications like that where you\u2019d be interested in adding on to your capabilities through M&A? Chuck Kummeth : Yes, we\u2019re hunting all the time. We\u2019ve probably never spent the quarter with so much activity and so little to show for it actually. We were \u2013 we came in second and third on a lot of deals in this quarter. So as you know, prices are high and we can be picky. We\u2019ve got great numbers. We\u2019ve got great growth. We\u2019ve got a great balance sheet, and there is no sense for us to overpay or take too stupid a risk or confuse the Street with something too adjacent that people don\u2019t understand. So we\u2019re being kind of true to our strategic plan, and we\u2019re hunting within those guidelines and within the math we want to find. And finding double-digit ROIC on deals have been very difficult right now. So we will be patient, and it means we\u2019re probably still lean more towards private deals where we can kind of get something with a management team and investors that understand this and want to come on board versus public auctions, which are \u2013 seem to be still in a friendly mode and going too high. Yes. We are focused on tools probably more so than diagnostics. I think we\u2019ve got enough things integrated now in diagnostics, and we see a great plan coming together between Exosome diagnostics, Asuragen and even our ACD platform. So there is a lot of growth coming there and also the Ella application. So we\u2019ve got quite a franchise forming and diagnostics that you\u2019ve probably got to start focusing back on tools and core areas if we can find it. They are just isn\u2019t enough out there and they are going very high, as you saw BioLegend went for over $5 billion. I mean, that\u2019s unbelievable. We have a comparable antibody business here that tells you something about our valuation. Catherine Schulte : Great, thanks. Operator : Thank you. We take our next question from Alex Nowak with Craig-Hallum. Alex Nowak : Great. Good morning everyone. Chuck, going on the diagnostics side, it seemed to be a little bit of a tone shift with the Asuragen acquisition closing, including Bio-Techne being more of a kit diagnostics company than a clear lab. Did I hear that correctly? And maybe expand on what you plan to push through the Asuragen kittable model that could include the EPI test, the Exosome TRU test that all the Exosome test they have in the pipeline? And then I guess the bigger picture in a couple of years here, do you think Bio-Techne\u2019s going to have both a CLIA lab and a kittable diagnostics model? Chuck Kummeth : Well, you\u2019re a diagnostics guy. So I know you get it. And yes, first of all, they are focused on their panel, right? Their panel here, what\u2019s Fragile X SMA and CF, which will be coming out here this fall. That will be a really kind of a best-in-class only thing you can get in the world kind of a panel. With that experience, of course, we want to kit as much as we can because we have a home kit version of our EPI test right now. We\u2019re launching that. We\u2019re in Europe, going through distribution with a kit. And we\u2019re expanding that model and probably deemphasizing the CLIA side over time. But CLIA is certainly important right now, we\u2019re doing the work. But over time, it will be a mix. I don\u2019t think, we probably totally ever out of CLIA. I think you need to be in CLIA because that\u2019s the way a good way to start these things, these tests of an LDT. And I think we will just see how the mix goes, but I think better scale potential. I think better faster acceleration exists with kitting if you can get it done. But as you know, it\u2019s a bit of an art to kit. And you need people who know how to do it, and there is a lot of details to get kitting successful and then channel issues, at which Asuragen team are really expert at. So they are definitely grueling over the chance to get at the Exosome portfolio, to be honest. So we\u2019re just trying to hold them off until we can integrate completely. We want to make sure that we take care of them fairly as part of the Asuragen deal first. It\u2019s all coming, spot on. Alex Nowak : No, that makes sense. And one just on ExoTRU, maybe any update on the commercialization plan there that could be a direct sales team, you\u2019re going to go through a partner. And then you mentioned the reimbursement on ExoTRU and you\u2019re currently working through NGS. Any update if you plan on seeking out in the lab to go after more of a MolDX MAC or just any update on the reimbursement progress there? Chuck Kummeth : Well, with Asuragen, we have the opportunity to be in their MAC district. So that\u2019s being evaluated. We also have a site near Atlanta, so we can be in the Palmetto area, which has the favorable jurisdiction here around CareDx. So that\u2019s \u2013 so we\u2019re not breaking ice there. That\u2019s also a very strong possibility. There is \u2013 with the numbers we\u2019ve shown in our papers, it\u2019s best-in-class, we beat everybody out there by far as far as I can tell. There is a lot of interest. All the main players are talking to us right now, and there is a potential for a partnership. We won\u2019t do a bad partnership. So if you see one, it will be great terms. Otherwise, we will go it. In my mind, this will be a hell a lot easier than the prostate test because, again, these are organ transplant centers, and we\u2019re not talking about a channel of 20,000 urologists. We\u2019re talking about less than 100 centers that we can deal with in almost like a key account model. We also don\u2019t have the wall to climb over of talking docs out of doing test like biopsies, right? So it\u2019s commercially should be somewhat simpler, especially to the great test a great number. So we\u2019ve done surveys with these rejection centers or these transplant centers. And they have come back over 90% positive. They want to try out the test, but they don\u2019t see what they are using today is being perfect by any means, and there is a more room for improvement. And what they have seen understand about the simplicity of a mail and type kittable test like we have with urine that they want to try it. So we\u2019re pretty gun hole. I think we had in our commentary, we expect to be out within a year here. Alex Nowak : No, that\u2019s great. Chuck Kummeth : I also think \u2013 I think the MAC will be easier on us too. This isn\u2019t the like prostate, the cancer you live with and not die from, like a perception is, which is inaccurate. This is a big bad one out there with double the market size. And as you know, half of all kidneys fail in 10 years and roughly 30% fail on the first 5. So it\u2019s an awful, awful condition. So finding something that\u2019s more upstream like exosomes can provide versus cell-free DNA could really help that primary physician or that the docs figure out what\u2019s going on before you have trouble. It is going to be really important to sustaining that thing or that organ long-term for the patient. Alex Nowak : Yes. Multi-exosome is very favorable there. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We take our next question from Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Patrick Donnelly : Hi, thanks for taking the question guys. Chuck, I know you called out China in the prepared remarks. I think you talked about 30% growth, approaching $100 million a year. You\u2019re usually pretty bullish on that, but how are you thinking about \u201822 setup there? Again, it seems like all things are pointing in the right direction for you guys, but would love your take on trends there in the quarter and then again the expectations for this year. Chuck Kummeth : Yes. Well, I think Jim was spot on going through the analysis and providing color on a 2-year look back, not just 1 year. It\u2019s just such a goofy year last year. And when you look at all our numbers on 2-year pre-pandemic, then you see, I think, still best-in-class results for our industry. And China is no different. So that\u2019s a near 30% high 20s for 2 years. We see that consistent. We\u2019ve always kind of said we expect China to be a 25% grower. And I guess we see no reason why not to stay with that game. And even as we get past $100 million, it\u2019s only $100 million. So we\u2019ve got a long way to go in China before we\u2019re going to take any victory laps. And the brand is a gold standard brand. There is no let down there. I think if anything, we\u2019re going to see things accelerate in China around research around our products, to be honest. There is this point of \u2013 we mentioned that we\u2019re tipping points in our commentary. I love the term because I think it\u2019s really accurate. Things need to get to a certain size before they get easier to sell. And we\u2019ve reached that point in a lot of our stable of unicorns here. We\u2019ve got a dozen different platforms that are all hitting and achieving and getting over that tipping point and becoming almost simpler to accelerate. So China is going to be very good at selling the whole stable and they have been and they are going to continue. So I think the numbers will be better going forward. Patrick Donnelly : That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe one on just the GMP order pace, you touched on it a little bit, but how is that trending relative to your expectation? I think last quarter you talked about plan to sell out inventory by September, October. I think you touched a little bit on it earlier, but would love just kind of a ground floor view there and expectations, how we should think about that piece? Jim Hippel : Well, we\u2019re closer and landing some more big customers, we land another one, another bigger one. I think 145% growth in the quarter coming out of our little headquarters facility, I think, is an amazing execution by the team to be honest. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve been over 100 before that, just we\u2019ve hanging on 100, so that\u2019s like record growth. We will start transitioning to the factory here come this fall. We\u2019re just \u2013 we\u2019re getting close right now, and there is a lot of excitement. The product looks fabulous. It\u2019s peer. It\u2019s the lot-to-lot consistency at the volumes we\u2019re going to be able to create are going to be best class in the world. No one is going to be able to compete with us in terms of that. So I really \u2013 we mean when we say get online and look at the video, you\u2019re going to see this factory and go, that\u2019s a deal closure for sure. And people who are coming in are amazed, and it\u2019s going to all come down to [indiscernible] testing and how fast we can ramp these bigger customers as they come off the other end. And there, as you know, hundreds of clinical. It\u2019s going to take a couple of years to get this thing really going. But I mean, to be honest, I think we\u2019re going to have an amazing business, but I don\u2019t think we will be alone. I think it\u2019s an everybody wins market here for 5 years, to be honest, so\u2026 Patrick Donnelly : Okay, got it. And maybe one last one for Jim, just on the op margin commentary. I think you said entering \u201822 will be a little lower than 4Q than the second half getting back to these levels. Can you just talk about, I guess, the key levers as we get into \u201822 again, some of the spend coming back? Maybe talk about the impact of exo and then kind of the underlying expansion as well would be great? Jim Hippel : Yes. I mean some of the factors on the margin. First of all is the acquisition of Asuragen, right? So for three out of the four quarters next year, it will be dilutive to overall margins to the tune of 70 to 100 basis points. So that\u2019s kind of a big headwind inherent right there. Of course, we even talked about getting back in front of customers and business travels somewhat returning. That\u2019s a pretty hefty number in itself in terms of a headwind year-over-year, assuming that that activity ramps back up. With regards to your comment on exo, I mean exo will become less dilutive going forward but still be dilutive. But as we continue our growth trajectory, despite those headwinds in the near-term, and let me back up for a second. We did hire pretty successful here in the \u2013 towards the end of Q4. So not necessarily representative in our fiscal year \u201821 run rate much less even the Q4 one, to be honest with you. And that will provide some headwind that you\u2019re not currently seeing. So all those factors combined, we see in the near-term the margin dipping slightly. But again, because as we continue to grow the back half of the year with the leverage we get from that growth, we see it normalizing back to Q4 level by the end of the year. Patrick Donnelly : Great. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We take our next question from Paul Knight with KeyBanc Capital. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, guys. It\u2019s Mike on for Paul. Just following up on Patrick\u2019s question on the operating margin line, I guess it sounds like the diagnostic genomics is going to take most of the impact with Asuragen. So I\u2019m guessing Protein Sciences kind of maintains the level that you saw in 2021. Can you kind of just talk to the dynamics between those two a little bit deeper? Thanks. Chuck Kummeth : Yes, I\u2019ll start and Jim can finish. I think that\u2019s right on. And clearly, our investment portfolio to when scaling it, it\u2019s going to help the overall mix. But our core continues to scale and continues to find leverage too. I would, quite frankly, amazed at how well we execute this year on our core. In the past, this hasn\u2019t been the kind of business model where you get as much leverage as other manufacturing models I\u2019ve been involved with. But we have found incredible productivity internally, and we have found more scale leverage than I thought possible. It\u2019s been helped, in fact, by, I think, as we talked about the hiring needed and the headcount shortages. I think we\u2019re a little lean there. We\u2019re catching up fast, started last quarter and travel, of course, has helped everyone. But the fact remains, even on gross margin is really strong, and we\u2019re finding leverage. I think it will continue. We\u2019re all pretty well Six Sigma trained here and PPI from Thermo and every other flavor of this productivity therapy you want to do, and we use them all here. We\u2019ve even talked about coining our own version, the Bio-Techne version because we do it, and we target and task our teams of productivity every year, and they find it. And I see it going forward. And maybe Jim wants to comment for that. Jim Hippel : Yes. In terms of how that margin might look like by segment, actually, right now, we think it might be slightly the opposite in terms of the impact. Protein Sciences already had a very high operating margin. And a lot of the hiring that we\u2019re behind on to accelerate growth in cell and gene therapy in other areas as well as the instrument portfolio will be in that Protein Science segment. So they\u2019ll be more heavily impacted by the actual investments that we need to make. You\u2019re correct in that the diagnostics genomics segment will be impacted by the Asuragen acquisition. But again, they have the lowest overall operating margin and that\u2019s where we\u2019ve gotten the most expansion in the past with leverage, and we expect that to continue and, frankly, overcome the Asuragen headwinds in that segment. So that\u2019s kind of how we see it playing out as of right now. Chuck Kummeth : Don\u2019t forget that that\u2019s an 80% plus gross margin kitting kind of model, which we understand. And so as that scales, that will reach up and won\u2019t add some to until near 40%, and we\u2019re in the high teens right now. So we\u2019ve got a ways to go. Come up 1,000 points in a year, but it\u2019s just starting to stride and it\u2019s on roughly a $90 million run rate. So we always said it\u2019d be probably at $40 million to about $200 million or so. And I don\u2019t see any reason to change that tone right now. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Very helpful. And then, Chuck, just on Asuragen, it looks like it came in a little bit ahead of expectations of what you were guiding back in Q3. So can you kind of unpack some of the trends you saw with the business there? Was that just organic growth within Asuragen? Was it some synergies playing out being underneath the Bio-Techne umbrella or some maybe easy comparables back in 2020? Chuck Kummeth : Yes. We\u2019re not breaking down division numbers anymore for competitive reasons I would say it\u2019s more or less on track. It wasn\u2019t really too much ahead. We\u2019ve given them a lot of homework. And if anything, keeping them and focused on their business and not over integrating with Exo too fast, I think, has been the challenge. They just know so much. They are so experienced. I can\u2019t also tell you how good this integration has been out of 17 acquisitions. This has been the easiest, these guys, a 15-year-old company. They all came and there was a spin-off of a bigger company, as you know. And so their financials are all auditable. It\u2019s just been more or less this team. They are all keepers, and we\u2019re working hard on doing that. Going forward, I think we bought them like we\u2019ve done a lot of acquisitions, been pretty good and sometimes clever in reaching some things just before that inflection point up. And these guys are no different. They have been working on this SMA and cystic fibrosis for a while and they are launching. So over the coming years as they launch, yes, I would expect there\u2019ll be some accelerated growth. That\u2019s what we\u2019re hoping for. It\u2019s where we bought them, among other things. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thanks for the time guys. Operator : Thank you. And as we have no further questions in the queue, I would like to turn the call back over for any additional and closing remarks. Chuck Kummeth : Okay. Well, thanks, everyone. It was a year we\u2019re all behind us in a lot of ways. But business-wise, we\u2019re quite happy with the results and that we\u2019re able to execute and provide the world with a lot of badly needed things this past year with the problems we\u2019ve all faced. We\u2019re ready to go in the future. We are investing. We are catching up in terms of headcount, the numbers look pretty good. The momentum, as Jim has said, is stable, and we see no reason to change our tone. And we will give you more transparency when you all show up in New York and attend. So thanks a lot. Bye. Operator : Thank you. That would conclude today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation, ladies and gentlemen. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning and welcome to the Bio-Techne Earnings Conference Call for the First Quarter of Fiscal Year 2022. At this time all participants have been placed in listen-only mode and the call will be open for questions followed by managements prepared remarks. During our Q&A session, please limit yourself to one question and one follow up. I would now like to turn the call over to David Clair, Bio-Techne's Senior Director, Investor Relations and Corporate Development. David Clair : Good morning and thank you for joining us. On the call with me this morning are Chuck Kummeth, Chief Executive Officer and Jim Hippel, Chief Financial Officer of Bio-Techne. Before we begin, let me briefly cover our Safe Harbor statement. Some of the comments made during this conference call maybe considered forward-looking statements, including beliefs and expectations about the company's future results as well as the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and financial results. The company's 10-K for fiscal year 2021 identifies certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements made during this call. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements because of any new information or future events or developments. The 10-K as well as the company's other SEC filings are available on the company's website within its Investor Relations section. During the call, non-GAAP financial measures may be used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. Tables reconciling these measures to most comparable GAAP measures are available in the company's press release issued earlier this morning on the Bio-Techne Corporation website at www.bio-techne.com. I will now turn the call over to Chuck. Chuck Kummeth : Thanks, Dave and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter conference call. The Bio-Techne team kicked off our fiscal 2022 on a very strong note, as we continued the momentum we experienced during our last fiscal year. Our first quarter 21% organic growth rate reflects broad strength across geographies and ongoing penetration and demand for our proteomic research reagents, diagnostic reagents, analytical tools and services especially within our biopharma end market. The standouts in the quarter included our instrument portfolio, namely our Biologics, Simple Western and Simple Plex offerings, broad strength across our research reagents, and triple digit growth for our burgeoning GMP protein business. Not only were these significant growth drivers for the quarter, but these platforms as well as our spatial biology and molecular diagnostics portfolio remain at the forefront of under penetrated high growth markets to position the company for future growth. I'm very proud of the global team's execution and the company is off to a great start as we march forward to the longer term targets we provided during our recent Investor Day event. We deliver this strong Q1 revenue performance with a continued focus on profitability with an adjusted operating margin of 37.8%. During the quarter, we made progress hiring to our growth plan. Although the tight labor market remained a constraint to us building a team at our desired pace. We anticipate making continued progress with our hiring plans as fiscal 2022 unfolds, supplementing the commercial and technical teams that will enable execution of our long-term growth plan. From a geographic perspective, we experienced robust growth across all geographies. China especially was a standout where the team delivered record organic growth of over 50% in the quarter. The government authorities there are strongly encouraging the development of therapies in the areas of stem cells, organoids, regenerative medicine, and immunology. All areas that have a strong need for our reagents and analytical solutions. For the first time this quarter our business in China annualized at over $100 million in revenue. While this is an important milestone, we believe we remain in the early innings of realizing our potential in this important geography. Turning to our end market. Demand for our unique high quality products and solutions continues to be very strong for our biopharma end users with revenue growth increasing approximately 25%. Performance within our academic end markets also remain solid overall delivering organic growth in the mid-single digits. Now let's discuss the performance of our growth platform starting with the Protein Sciences segment where we delivered organic growth of 26% in the quarter. We made significant progress with our cell and gene therapy initiatives as growing awareness and demand for our portfolio of workflow solutions led to over 60% organic growth in the quarter. We are nearing completion of the qualification process for initial lots of GMP grade proteins out of our state of the art GMP protein manufacturing facility in Saint Paul, Minnesota, and anticipate commercial orders to be shipped from the facility in the coming weeks. As a reminder, GMP proteins are critical ingredients for growing both autologous and allogeneic cell therapies and we anticipate increasing demand going forward as the rich pipeline of therapies make their way through the regulatory approval process. Our GMP protein business increased over 160% in a quarter. And with our new GMP manufacturing facility open for business, we are well positioned to meet the anticipated growing demand for these critical reagents. Continuing in cell gene therapy, we added to our portfolio especially cell culture products with the launch of ExCellerate iPSC Expansion Medium, a new medium for the expansion and maintenance of induced pluripotent stem cells or iPSCs for use in both research and translational workflows. The ExCellerate iPSC Expansion Medium builds on Bio-Techne's portfolio products and services in regenerative medicine and fits seamlessly into our offerings for stem cell workflows, including cell isolation, reprogramming, genome engineering, cell expansion, differentiation and characterization. Importantly, ExCellerate iPSC Expansion Medium is manufactured without using components derived from animals or humans, making it ideally suited for use in translational research to produce iPSC based cell and gene therapies. This latest offering builds on our growing portfolio especially cell culture products addressing customer needs across natural killer or an NK, T cell and B cell media. Momentum in our core research use only protein and antibody businesses also continues to be very strong, with growth in the low 20s in the quarter. We believe that continued success in our core is a reflection of our best in class development of a new high quality relevant reagents that address our customers' current research needs, while making them increasingly aware of our capabilities through our strategic digital marketing efforts. Moving on now to our proteomic analytical tools, where we continue to see strong demand across our portfolio of cost effective productivity solutions. In Q1 our instruments and related consumable pull through grew over 30%. Reflective of a very strong biopharma environment, our Biologics instruments led the way growing nearly 50%. These analytical tools, namely our Maurice instrument, enable the reproducible and quantitative analysis of therapeutic protein identity, purity, homogeneity, with ease of use fast results, and reproducibility all qualities that continue to represent a compelling proposition for new and existing CROs, CDMOs large pharma accounts and we are now also seeing adoption in cell and gene therapy quality control applications. Demand for our Simple Western instruments also continues to be strong with over 20% growth compared to the prior year. Encouragingly, we are seeing significant lead generation for Abby and sold several of these systems during its first full quarter on the market. As a reminder, Abby is a lower cost fully automated chemiluminescence western platform that we introduced in April to further penetrate Simple Western technology into our academic customer base. Separately, we saw real robust adoption, of Simple Western within cell and gene therapy market and view this is a significant and largely untapped opportunity for this technology going forward. Our Simple Plex multiplexing amino acid system Ella, also had a strong quarter growing over 20%. This result is especially impressive given the challenging year-over-year comparison where Simple Plex increased more than 75% in the prior year period. We are experiencing a significant uptick in Ella accounts using or evaluating the platform for neuro degenerative applications specifically for neurofilament light chain or neuro NFL and neurofilament heavy chain or NFL detection in serum and plasma. Ella continues to be the platform of choice for customers requiring excellent sensitivity and assay speed. Now let's discuss our diagnostics and genomic segment where organic revenue increased 6% in the quarter. Our spatial biology business branded ACD increased mid-single digits in the quarter as continued demand from our biopharma customers, especially CROs was partially offset by lower reorder rates from our academic customers. I would note our ACD business and especially in the academia market faced a challenging comp in the prior year when the business increased over 30%. Within biopharma, the emergence of gene therapy and RNA interface or RNAI therapeutics has created a shift toward an animal model based projects, driving larger order sizes and increasing custom probe design projects making for a little more lumpiness in our spatial biology business. Our menu of process is now approaching 50,000 targets over many species and publications have crossed over 4500 demonstrating the continued academic interest in the platform. Next, our diagnostics reagents business delivered its ninth consecutive quarter of growth, with organic revenue increasing in the upper single digits. Encouragingly, the pandemic related headwinds that impacted his business in recent quarters are starting to diminish and we are experiencing a reacceleration in the chemistry, glucose and hematology controls product lines. The diminishing headwinds combined with new product launches, and additional penetration within existing OEM customers, we believe are just at the beginning of accelerated growth in this business. During our Investor Day, we highlighted some organizational changes within our diagnostics and genomics segment, designed to fully realize across developmental opportunities and synergies within our liquid biopsy and molecular products businesses. The new molecular diagnostics division is a combination of our Exosome Diagnostics business, and the recent Asuragen acquisition and is being led by Matt McManus, the former CEO of the legacy Asuragen business. This new division structure includes an Exosome center of excellence as the Exosome based liquid biopsy innovation engine, developing lab developed test, companion diagnostics as well as kitted Exosome based diagnostic products. We will leverage the established Asuragen channel as well as our two CLIA labs to commercialize these products. Our ExoDx prostate cancer test continues to make progress despite ongoing challenges with the urology market. During COVID patients were not leaving their home to do annual checkups or seeing urologists. This dramatically reduced the volume of PSA test the primary tool used by urologists to identify the appropriate patients for our ExoDx test for prostate cancer risk analysis and potential biopsy. With patients' beginning to return to their doctors for routine checkups or follow ups, the diagnostic market is continuing to recover and encouragingly our Q1 ExoDx volume was the highest since the onset of the pandemic and continues to show improvement early in Q2. I would also note that our sales reps are increasingly getting in person meetings and hosting educational and awareness events with the physician community, which we expect to be a strong impetus to testifying going forward. We also made progress on ExoDx reimbursement front during the quarter. We added to contracts with multiple regional payers expanding both a network of private payers reimbursing for ExoDx and men with covered access to test. We are very excited about the opportunity to present at an overview of the science and publication supporting ExoDx to 600 medical directors and policy decision makers this week during NAMCP's 2021 Live Fall Managed Care Forum. The confirmed audience includes representatives from the largest national and regional payers. Events like this are an excellent opportunity to drive awareness and acceptance and eventually reimbursement of this important test among the private payer community. Our recent publication of a pooled analysis of over 1200 patients in the journal of prostate cancer and prostatic diseases demonstrated ExoDx's ability to discriminate between high grade, low grade and benign prostate cancer. Using ExoDx's validated 15.6 cutoff score would have avoided 23% of all prostate biopsies and 30% of unnecessary biopsies with a negative predictive value of 90%. We have a pipeline of additional studies and anticipate a steady cadence of publications to drive reimbursement and adoption going forward. In addition to the ExoDx prostate tests, we continue to advance our pipeline of innovative Exosome based diagnostic tests including our non-invasive kidney transplant rejection assay Exo TRU Kidney. As a reminder, initial Exo TRU Kidney data was published earlier this year in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, showing a negative predictive value of 93.3%, and a positive predictive value of 86.2%, which we view as best in class performance versus the competition. We are preparing additional studies for publication on Exo TRU assay performance, and remain on track to launch this non-invasive urine based assay later in our fiscal year. With regards to the products from the legacy Asuragen business, we continue to gain market traction with our leading portfolio of genetic and oncology molecular diagnostic products, including our kits for FMR1 and Bcr-Abl. This business is largely US centric today and we see significant potential for these products outside the US and have taken initial steps to position the business to penetrate the European markets. In addition to the geographic expansion, this business has a very full pipeline, including the expected launches of a cystic fibrosis or CFTR kit as well as a hard to do panel, which combines carrier screening assays for FMR1, SMA1 and 2 and CFTR in one user friendly kit. To conclude my opening comments, our fiscal '22 is off to a great start. Our end markets remain strong, and our portfolio of differentiated proteomic tools reagents and electrodiagnostic products are meeting the needs of our customers in growing and under penetrated markets. Our cell and gene therapy initiatives continue to gain acceptance from biopharma customers, and the deepening relationships with these end users are driving adoption of our proteins, media, assays instrumentation, antibodies and other offerings in our portfolio. During our recent Investor Day in New York City, our leadership team and I laid out the vision and strategy to bring Bio-Techne from 1 billion revenue company it is today to a target of $2 billion over the next five years. Our first quarter end we are off to a great start in this journey, and I'm excited to share our progress as we realize this vision over the many quarters to come. With that I'll hand the call over to Jim. Jim Hippel : Thanks, Chuck. I'll provide an overview of our Q1 fiscal 2022 financial performance for the total company, provide some additional details on the performance of each of our segments and give some thoughts on the remainder of the fiscal year. Starting with the overall first quarter financial performance, adjusted EPS was $1.83 versus $1.43 one year ago, an increase of 28% over last year. Foreign exchange positively impacted EPS by $0.07. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $1.69 compared to $0.83 in the prior year. The biggest driver for the increase in GAAP EPS other than from business operations, was unrealized gains on our investment in ChemoCentryx this year compared to an unrealized ChemoCentryx loss in the prior year period. Q1 revenue was 257.7 million, an increase of 26% year-over-year on a reported basis and 21% on an organic basis. Foreign exchange translation had a favorable 1% year-over-year impact and acquisition had a favorable 4% impact for revenue growth. All geographies had strong growth and one led by China growing over 50% followed by the US and EMEA both growing over 20% for the quarter, the rest of the world grew in the upper teens. By end market biopharma remained very strong growing near 20% while academia increase mid-single digits year-over-year. Moving on to the details of the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin was 71.2% in the quarter compared to 71.9% in the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by unfavorable product mix within the protein sciences segment partially offset by favorable volume leverage. Adjusted SG&A in Q1 was 25.1% of revenue, a 70 basis point decrease compared to the prior year, while R&D expense in Q4 was 8.3% of revenue, 40 basis points higher than the prior year. While adjusted SG&A and R&D spend both increase sequentially and compared to the prior year, a tight Life Sciences labor market not allow us to fill all planned headcount additions to the team at the pace we originally anticipated, especially in the more technical, scientific and engineering fields. However, our pace of hiring continues to increase and we plan to make additional progress in our fiscal second quarter. This investment in critical human capital will position the company for growth going forward. The result in adjusted operating margin for Q1 was 37.8%, a decrease of 40 basis points from the prior year period. However, excluding the impact of the Asuragen acquisition made last April, adjusted operating margin increased 40 basis points over the prior year. Looking at numbers below operating income, net interest expense in Q1 was 3.1 million, decreasing1.1 million compared to the prior year period. The decrease was due to a continued reduction of our bank debt as well as a lower blended interest rate. Our bank debt in the balance sheet as of the end of Q1 stood at 300.2 million. Other adjusted non-operating income was 1.2 million for the quarter compared to 1.1 million in expense in the prior year, primarily reflecting the foreign exchange impact related to our cash pooling arrangements. For GAAP reporting, although non-operating income includes unrealized gains from our investment and ChemoCentryx. Moving further down the P&L, our adjusted effective tax rate in Q1 was 21%. As a reminder, during the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we made a strategic equity investment in China based Eminence, a company focused on providing media as well as custom cell line development and media formulation services to the Chinese biopharmaceutical market. The $634,000 non-controlling interest line item reflects the loss from a portion of Eminence we do not own. The impact of other lines of the P&L as a result of consulting Eminence was immaterial in Q1. Turning to cash flow and return of capital. 48.4 million of cash was generated from operations in the quarter compared to 66 million in the prior year period. The decrease was primarily driven by the timing of cash payments for payroll, income taxes and other accounts payable. In Q1, our net investment in capital expenditures was 6.1 million, and during Q1, we returned capital to shareholders by way of 12.5 million in dividends. We finished Q1 with 41.2 million average diluted shares outstanding. Our balance sheet finished Q1 in a very strong position with 235.1 million in cash and short-term available for sale investments, and a total leverage ratio of well under one times EBITDA. Next, I'll discuss the performance of our reporting segments starting with Protein Sciences segment. Q1 reported sales were 197.2 million, with reported revenue increasing 28% compared to the prior year. Organic growth increased 26% with foreign exchange having a favorable impact of 2% on revenue growth. Within this segment, the strong growth was very broad based in nearly all reagent assay and instrument platforms. As Chuck mentioned, cell and gene therapy increased over 60%, including growth over 160% in our GMP protein products, while biologics grew almost 50% and our Simple Western, Simple Plex, proteins and antibodies all grew at least 20%. Operating margin for the Protein Sciences segment was 45.7%, an increase of 10 basis points year-over-year due primarily to favorable volume leverage, largely offset by strategic investments to support future growth. Turning to the Diagnostics and Genomics segment, Q1 reported sales worth 61 million, with reported revenue increasing 22%. Organic growth for this segment was 6%, with acquisitions contributing 15% and foreign exchange translation having a favorable 1% impact on revenue. The diagnostics reagents business increased upper single digits, and the ACD branded spatial biology portfolio increased mid-single digits. Although spatial biology had a challenging year-over-year comparable this quarter, we view this business unit as being in a high growth area within life science tools, and are extremely well positioned to capitalize on this growth with our multi-omics product portfolio. For Exosome Diagnostics, revenue was lower year-over-year, but this was mostly due to cash to accrual revenue recognition accounting change in the prior year for Medicare patients. Timing of companion diagnostics projects with biopharma customers also negatively impacted growth for the quarter. Exosome Diagnostic prostate cancer test volume continues to improve with more patients now going back to see their physicians. Test counts increased 20% year-over-year in Q1 and are continuing to ramp as we enter Q2. Moving on to Diagnostics and Genomics segment operating margin, at 12.2% the segment's operating margin decreased 510 basis points compared to the prior year. The decrease reflects the impact of strategic investments to support future growth as well as the Asuragen acquisition. In summary, our research oriented end markets remain strong. And as our Q1 performance indicated, we are executing extremely well on serving these markets. The diagnostics end market is also improving and we believe will continue to be a tailwind going forward. Our end markets have been on an upward march since the depths of the COVID crisis in the fourth quarter of our fiscal 2020. This means our comps become increasingly more challenging and our growth rates will likely be tempered proportionately in the near term. However, given our strong performance out of the gate in Q1, we have increasing confidence that we can achieve a growth rate in fiscal year 2022 that is greater than our two year CAGR at the end of fiscal year 2021. As Chuck and I mentioned in our prior commentary, despite progress executing to our hiring plan, there is more to do in order to support our long-term growth plans. We anticipate continued progress in our hiring objectives to put downward pressure on our adjusted operating margins sequentially in the near term, before returning to prior year levels by the end of our fiscal Q4. That concludes my prepared comments. And with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Puneet Souda of SVB Leerink. Please proceed with your question. Puneet Souda : Hi, thanks, Chuck, Jim. Thanks for the questions here. So first one on GMP proteins, clearly strong. Just wondering if you could parse that out was that due to qualifications of new orders or additional orders sort of shipping out in the quarter. 160% is really strong and obviously maybe it seems like it's coming off of small comparisons of last year. But just trying to understand the sustainability of the GMP growth and how should we think about an annualized growth rate here for GMP proteins in 2022? Chuck Kummeth : Yeah, we've been pretty clear in the past that their growth rate for next couple of years is probably at 100% level. So we're ahead of that. But we're still - as of today, we're actually open for business. The factory has an inventory of lot qualified material, products and we've been gaining more and more, I guess, customers. You saw the slides in the investor deck talk about the potential domain of customers, we're got a couple dozen already. And we're getting a lot of help from our scale ready partners to dramatically increase that. So we're getting more scale for existing customers, and we're getting more customers. So therefore the lift. We're well over a $20 million run rate, which is really just the beginning right Puneet, so kind of we're on track. We're ready to start transitioning as much as we can of our orders into the new factory. As you know, we have the largest catalogue out there for GMP proteins, but we know we're only set up for a handful right now in the new factory, and in the majority of businesses really in under 10 type of product versus the 50 or so we have in our catalogue. We still - a lot of capacity back at headquarters, it's just in small lots. So we are ready to go on the bigger lots for a few of the more important products that are being asked for being put into clinicals, et cetera. And I see the growth rates to be largely consistent with our guidance and I think it'll continue. Puneet Souda : Okay, great. Thanks for that details, Chuck. So on ACD, wondering if there's something we need to keep in mind for sort of second quarter. Just it seems the comments you made were around lumpiness. But this is the first time we're seeing sort of mid-single digit growth here after the leadership change to happen in that business. And just trying to understand is this - should we just continue to expect lumpiness in the business and/or is there any competitive dynamics that we need to be aware of, just trying to think about the full year number that's traditionally been more than 10% here historically for ACD. Chuck Kummeth : We're as bullish as ever on this platform, you got to remember, the comp was amazing they were coming off of, and then we had - the lumpiness primarily in the service area. But we do a lot of custom work. And that part was - just balances, it's just kind of ebbs and flows. So that combined with - as you know, we're a couple 100 people right in our hiring plan, just like the rest of the world. I mean, we added 275 people last quarter, and we lost 240, we're net 35 ahead, which is even better than average out there. So it's been really crazy, especially in the Bay area, and guess where ACD lives in the Bay area. So we are we are shorter there than most other business units. We are also the largest spatial business out there. So we're a target as well, especially for our reps and we're definitely shorthanded in our reps, we've put additional focus on it now. And we're correcting that. But those are the kind of the one, two and three issues of why this was mid-single digit growth and why it wasn't 15 to 20. It's - there's no issue, it's all there. It's actually looks better than ever. DNA scope is coming on. We have X-Plex coming on. We are working forward with other partnership ideas with automation. We're stronger than ever with Leica. We're getting going with Antenna. The leadership changes we made year, year and a half ago, have done pretty well. And it's more an issue of comps, lumpiness, especially in services, and probably a handful of sales reps short in some key areas that we need to get refilled. But we'll do we'll do that. That's kind of nature of the beast in SPD. It's a hot area, spatial and generally, so a lot of movement right now. So we'll win, don't worry. Puneet Souda : Got it. And last one quickly on China if I could. 100 million really great to see that number, but just in terms of what can you do in China now at the current scale versus you couldn't do before? And how should we think about the sustainability of growth there in China? You obviously highlighted, strong long-term, but just how should we think about this year? Thank you. Chuck Kummeth : We're not saying it over and boat. So inventory. So that's a good thing. We ship it in. We can sell as much there as they can. We can ship as much in as they need to sell. The growth rate - forever we've talked about - my goal of getting this growth rate in China over 25%. And being told consistently, it's just impossible to grow more than that in China. It's hard. And we've been roughly about 25% over the years here and today is just to remind you it's my is my 35th earnings call for this company. So we're just ecstatic that we just knock it out of the park and all cylinders are now instrumentation is just flying. Big part of it. But it's also in our regions. So we're on all cylinders. We are increasing our inventory levels. We are looking at shipment schedules. We're giving them all the help they need. We didn't have any supply issues last quarter and we're trying to work on that going forward. Everyone's talking about supply chain problems. We haven't had any to date, knock on wood we won't have in the future, but we're trying to be as careful as we can. I would just say it's broad based. And this is one year, we had great growth for SPD by the way. It was a strong growth there. It's just small, but it's a good sign of the future. I would love to see us be safely at 25% or better in China, which we've always said 20 to 25. And for this year 25, or better, looks pretty good now, when you start out at 50, over 50. Puneet Souda : Great, super helpful Chuck. Thanks. Chuck Kummeth : I don't think I've seen any peer so far, having numbers this great as good in China. So we're definitely in the right areas. And we're taking sharing antibodies, which is great to see. Puneet Souda : Great, congrats on the growth there. Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from Dan Arias with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Dan Arias : Good morning guys. Thanks for the questions. Chuck, on Simple Plex, can you just talk about how system utilization there looks like attracting the quarter relative to the first half of the calendar year. And then when you look at the instrument portfolio, I'm sort of curious where if anywhere you think we should think about growth in consumables pull through per instrument this year? It feels like it's easier to envision that for Simple Western and Biologics more than Simple Plex, but I'd love to hear what's your take on . Chuck Kummeth : You're right, Dan. And by the way, congrats. I think your predictions for our quarter are like within 1%. So we should be using you more often on our staff maybe, but - Dan Arias : I couldn't agree more Chuck. Chuck Kummeth : Yeah. Simple Flex is the lumpiness of the bunch. Now we have $12,000 a pull through per instrument on Simple Western, we have roughly 15 on Biologics, it's 50 on Simple Plex, it's huge. This is a closed system, we made the cartridge for the customer and less, it's an open cartridge, which some customers use especially to start to figure out their assay. So that that makes it lumpier by definition. We actually had over 50% growth in instruments this quarter. So we're well on track for instrument deployment. And with that kind of pull through, it's all about getting boxes out there. So we're very bullish. It's just coming off a huge comp from last year is one thing. So we studied all that. We're sitting pretty good. I think, in a lot of the use of large studies. And so some of the instruments - some of the cartridge orders get very large and then that's what makes it somewhat lumpy. So we could have, a complete turnaround in cartridges next quarter, and then all of sudden, we're you know, back to 50%, 60% growth. It didn't really help us much in the instrument front. Because we've been right against the rail of trying to finish out our orders every quarter. And this quarter wasn't much different, because instrument growth was still 50%. We're having to build a whole new factory just down the road from Arad. We will be done in a year with that. So that's off and running. We did take cartridge manufacturing up last year. And then we've got a couple 100 a week, I think this last quarter of forgiveness of which will hopefully fill back up but it's still very strong year-on-year. So I think all things aside, it's still full steam ahead. It's a $50 million plus run rate or better now and probably over more than half the size of Quanterix. And we're gaining traction on them and others out there. Dan Arias : Yeah, okay. All right. That's helpful. Thank you. And then Jim, if I'm hearing your comments on the outlook correctly, it sounds like you're calling out the comps that are obviously getting harder, but the confidence in getting above the historical average is higher. And that average that you're thinking about is the 13% number that you alluded to last on, I believe you talked about at the Investor Day, is that right? Jim Hippel : That is correct. Dan Arias : Okay, thanks a bunch. Jim Hippel : Thanks, Dan. Operator : Our next question is from Jacob Johnson of Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Jacob Johnson : Hey, good morning. Maybe chuck on the cell and gene therapy side, I think you've been clear that that end markets an opportunity for you and a lot of initiatives there. But it seems like yourself, and maybe some others saw some pickup in activity from that end market this quarter. Is there something that's changed in the end market? Or was the kind of performance you put up this quarter, just a function of kind of your internal efforts and GMP? Chuck Kummeth : Yeah. I think so. Yeah, I can answer that. It's plain old fashioned critical mass. So this is getting bigger and bigger. Our scale ready partners are doing better and better out there and they're providing additional visibility to our agents to be embedded within their solutions in clinicals. And we're just getting more and more traction, more and more reorders. The orders are going up in size, but it's just we aren't even to the pregame warm ups yet for the size of this market. It's all preclinicals and clinicals, and it's already getting sizable. I mean, this, I've mentioned the word tsunami in the past this, this is going to be a hallway that I think is just going to be hard to stay on top of, it's a couple of two, three, four or five years. So in our - we've talked in the past about this division of the future being in five years, 300 million or so, it might be dramatically larger than that. We don't see a lot of people catching up to us or doing we're doing with total workflow, and we've got like 10 stops on the flywheel here for cell and gene therapy workflow. I think we're going to be nearly unstoppable. And the lead position, of course, as GMP proteins, and being a protein leader in the world, we expect to fully capitalize on that first, and then follow with everything else we have to our customers who are amazed at all the things we are able off already. So it's a one stop shop now as a portfolio. We had our first customer, I wouldn't call it a full audit, but a great tour and partial audit of our new factory and they were blown away. Jacob Johnson : Got it. That makes sense. I guess maybe Chuck, the natural follow up to that I guess, you've got the capabilities you have today. But it seems to me you probably like to add to that at some point. Can you just talk about your thoughts on adding cell and gene therapy capabilities? The potential to do that organically and maybe thoughts on inorganic efforts there as well? Chuck Kummeth : Well, I think there's the antibody side, we're going to continue to build out. We just talked about the launch of the medium. We're definitely are looking beyond T cell and NK. So there's a lot of expansion just in the therapeutic side. I think instrumentation wise, we're in great shape. It's amazing. We've had over $2 million of revenue this quarter and Simple Plex being designed into call a QC type of applications for cell and gene therapy. And Maurice is going to be used in purity as expected. So we've got a lot going there. There, we don't have everything. I mean, the non-viral future that we're trying to be part of will use electroporation. We do not have an electroporation partner at this point we're using we're kind of ubiquitous. We have our favorites, but there's more than one out there. That'd be an area. I think there's always room for more spatial interrogation. I think we have RNA scope. And that'll be used, but I think with the right automation, we can probably get into the production side of that, QC sides. So there's a few spots we're looking at. But we got a lot of it covered and with great partners like Wilson Wolf bioreactors who have hundreds of customers and the new cube platform from Fresenius, which we think out does the competition on all fronts. I think it's going to be an amazing future and hopefully we'll be talking about billions in revenue in a few years, not just hundreds of millions. Jacob Johnson : Alright, I'll leave it on that point. Thanks, Chuck. Operator : Our next question is from Alex Nowak of Craig-Hallum. Please proceed with your question. Alex Nowak : Great. Good morning, everyone. Chuck, as we reached the end of the calendar year, what are you hearing beyond the US about life science budget next year specifically thinking Europe and China any reason to suspect a slowdown are these budgets as strong as ever? Chuck Kummeth : We're not hearing anything negative yet. I mean, Europe you saw the numbers, over 20% growth seems to be really good country by country. We're kind of through all the Brexit stuff. We're opening up an entirely new warehouse facility in Dublin. We're working to be probably seen some tax savings and other mainland Europe type of changes going forward that will help us. Asia really looks good on all fronts except India. India, even is dramatically good for hell with trouble they're still in. Japan is stable. Korea's growing well, Southeast Asia is really back on track better than it's been in a while. And China again, we talked about the numbers they're kind of off the charts. We're in the China's second year now going into their five year plan, which is just a big spend here, so for the next couple of years, it should be big spending in China. And we'll see. Alex Nowak : Yeah, that's good. And now that Matt McManus has been - you just had the ExosomeDx. And then the Asuragen business now under him through this new molecular diagnostics unit, has him or the team recommended any changes to the ExosomeDx sales strategy with either Abby or the upcoming Eco TRU. Any push to kid those tests or really any changes to the pipeline focus? Chuck Kummeth : Not really No, I mean, they provide incredible help for us on the regulatory side as well as kidding, which you saw mentioned that you and saw us mentioned to CLIA labs, not one because they have one too. You saw us mention the center of excellence, so that really is implying partners. So we're going to be able to focus on a lot more call them indications, different tests, because this is a platform not a one trick pony. And we're going to be doing some ourselves and we're going to be going in parallel with other partners and other channels. So those negotiations, those relationships are well underway and forming and new ones happen. There's a lot of interest in all of these things we're talking about, and I think it's going to be amazing future. And that's the right guy. Alex Nowak : No, get it. And I understand you're not shipping stuff via boat to your customers. But I guess at the customer level on the supply chain, is there anything that's getting shore basic materials, and obviously labor that would cause maybe your customers to see a slowdown and thus, push the slowdown up to you? Chuck Kummeth : Well, I think killer growth we've been seeing in the last few quarters, our biggest issue has been labor, for sure. It's hiring. And we've made some - we've made improvements. We're catching up. But we keep seeing in 20% plus growth, which we'd love to see. We've got to stay in the game here on that first. In terms of supplies, we put the word out early on and we're not making cars here, right. So it's a supply chain issues, aren't that complicated. Our instrumentation, I think we've looked into, are we going to see a chip shortage or something like that? Well, again we're making hundreds of a certain instrument per year, it's not 1000s. So it's not too big a deal. And these are not million dollar instruments, either. These are great productivity tools that are roughly $100,000 to $50,000, in that range. So it's doable. Not to say we won't see a problem next quarter whenever, I mean, if things don't start getting better there's mundane things like labels and paint and chassis ease and everything else, but we're staying on it. All we can say is we had no issue last quarter. And we don't foresee a problem this quarter. But you can promise everything we'll see. Jim Hippel : Chuck, if I could add from our customers' perspective, one of the things we keep an eye on is our daily sales of our reagents. And we talked about our core reagents, proteins, antibodies were up 20% year-over-year. So that's a good indication of the activity that's going on in our customers labs, so it doesn't appear as though any supply chain issues are slowing them down. Alex Nowak : That's great. Thank you appreciate it. Operator : Our next question is from Catherine Schulte of Baird. Please proceed with your question. Catherine Schulte : Hey, guys, congrats on the quarter and thanks for the questions. Is first on Exo TRU, have you made a decision on whether you'll commercialize the test on your own versus finding a partner there? And then I believe your previous target had been to launch it in calendar year '21. So is that still the plan and if not what's driving the delay there? Chuck Kummeth : Yeah, it's going to be close to calendar year. I think it's possible. I mean, it all comes down to the LET and there isn't anything regulatory wise we have to really commit to now which is working with NGS, so it's anyone's guess. So we're kind of ready to go. There's a - we have the second study being written now. The data is all been collected. So we're often running on more data than we need to launch. On the partnership front, there's been a lot of interest. So we're kind of, to be honest, we're kind of waiting through the interest here and seeing what makes sense from us strategically, as well as business wise, but good chance it could happen, but stay tuned. Catherine Schulte : And then you talked a bit about government funding for life science research, but if we think about the pharma and biotech side of the business we've seen robust funding over the last couple of years, but some volatility in in biotech financing over the last few months. So what's your outlook for that end market? And how much of that is driven by what we see on the biotech financing side? Chuck Kummeth : It was a tremendous quarter. And that's been followed up by previous tremendous quarters. I think, everything from vaccine makers to bioteches in general, there's been big demand. We had roughly flat on COVID. But there's a lot of halo stuff coming off of all that it's creating more investment opportunities by all of biotech, biopharma and we're participating all that because we work in all levels of the food chain and those businesses, so it's been good for us. I mean, you don't look any further than - you have 20% growth in proteins and antibodies doesn't get more fundamental than that, it's just proof that the funding is strong. Catherine Schulte : Great, thank you. Chuck Kummeth : I should make a comment to that. Our digital strategies are also continuing to work and work really well. We had just in our antibody channels alone. We had in our Novus brand over 50% year-on-year traffic increases. In our R&D systems brand our premier products 75% year-over-year traffic increases on our websites. That's pretty amazing. That's why we're taking share. Operator : Our next question is from Patrick Donnelly of Citi. Please proceed with your question. Patrick Donnelly : Hey, guys, thanks for taking the questions. Chuck, you touched a little bit on some of the inflationary pressures, labor, et cetera. Jim, I was wondering if you could just talk through kind of the moving pieces on the margin side, as we work through the rest of the year between again, some of the rising costs, Exo and then obviously, again, you guys pushing some of that price over to the customers just want to make sure we talk through that. Jim Hippel : Yeah. On the inflationary aspect of it, we're trying to manage that through combination of productivity as well as selected price increases. So we're not necessarily forecasting the margin pressure as a result of that. You may recall, last quarter, when I talked about the margin view for fiscal '22. We said initially, that we expected a sequential hit to our margins. I think I messaged roughly a percentage point due to the acquisition of Asuragen and roughly a percentage point due to getting caught up in our hiring for strategic growth. And that was going to impact us in the first half of the year. And given that we did make some successes around hiring. We didn't go - we didn't hire as much as we had planned. And therefore, actually, our margin was better than we internally thought it would be for Q1. And we think we will catch up in Q2. So I think the message that I left you with at the end of last quarter is the same and that by the time we get to the end of the first half of this fiscal year, we're expecting our year-over-year margin to be down roughly two percentage points, one - as one point as a result of a surgeon and the other point as a result of strategic growth investments, then that'll start to rapidly recover in the second half of the year, so that by the time we get to the end of Q4, we think we'll be year-over-year pretty comparable. Patrick Donnelly : Okay, that's helpful. And then Chuck, just on the Exo side, encouraging to hear about the volume recovery there, sales seems like it's get - the reps are able to get into the docs. Where do you think we are there in terms of the recovery? What are you hearing from customers, again, as the pandemic hopefully lifts, I just want you to talk through expectations on that front? Chuck Kummeth : Well, it's coming back fast, especially this quarter. I mean, we had 1700 docs order last year with about two thirds on a reorder rate. And already this year, this fiscal year-to-date, one quarter, and we're over 1100. So it's really picking up steam. And we see that really from just more customer touch, the reps are being like that back in. If the reps aren't seeing the docs, it's hard to get orders, it's just that simple. And the patients have got to be seeing them and getting PSA tests. So there's something to talk about. So it's all coming back pretty quickly. So I still think we're really in early innings here. It's just getting started. And there's like 15,000, 20,000 different docs out there. So we've been we've really addressed like 20%. So it's just a matter of getting it going and imagine dilution, which we're doing a really good job of, and Matt and team are going to be helping a lot as well. And there's leverage there. So that's also probably part of the improvement already in a quarter is just by the McManus team taking over, but stay tuned. We're really excited. Got one out there ramping Exo TRU ready to come and we're in discussions on a bunch more that we are doing and can do. And it's an amazing technology and its way more predictive than cell free DNA way more upstream. Patrick Donnelly : Great, thanks, Chuck. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Paul Knight of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Paul Knight : Chuck, when you see customers gain, let's call it maturity at your GMP protein production facility. What do you think the average size will be? Chuck Kummeth : For a customer? Paul Knight : Yeah. Chuck Kummeth : Well, I can tell you right now, it's hard for them to forecast. And so we've done our contracting in terms of percentages. So the deals we put in place, which are quite a few at this point. As they get beyond clinicals and go into production, we are contracted to receive 95% of the volume they need. This is such a critical area. They're always going to have backups and we're going to get backup for some probably as well. But that's good. Most of come in with the requirements before they get started with us and they range from between $10 million a year annualized per protein all the way to a couple over 50 million. Of course this is for them getting through their clinicals and surviving and meeting their sales forecasts, of course, but this is orders of magnitude beyond proteins for REO, right. So I don't think you'll see anything in production of a therapeutic for probably less than a $1 million per protein, to be honest. Paul Knight : And these cost is what, starting out at preclinical Chuck? Chuck Kummeth : Most of these are preclinical, some in clinical at this point, but we're at we're at a couple of dozen in, we're being looked at by our scale ready partners. As an example, go from Wolf bioreactors becoming a de facto standard, it's in well over a couple 100 different accounts out there in clinicals. And they're out there putting pressure and talking to their customers about, if you just choose the proteins from Bio-Techne, we can actually deliver them already encapsulated, ready to be reconstituted in the bioreactor. So it takes a bunch of risk, and a bunch of cost off the table for you. And their eyes are lighting up. So we're getting that process going, it'll take a year or two. But that's the kind of opportunity we have by being part of scale ready. Paul Knight : Okay. And then what's your read on the mRNA market? Number of candidates, customer interest, whatever metric you see or feel since we've had, obviously the COVID vaccine success? Chuck Kummeth : Well, if you land at Moderna, there'd be 20 different drugs they are working on that are going to use mRNA, right. So good premier wise, they've landed a great - they've been in the right place at the right time and have a great product and they've got Cap technology IP to get around. So mRNA is probably tougher for the rest that's out there then plasmids per se. But we're working on all these I think in a couple of years, we'll be in all this stuff at some level. It's not rocket science is read down our alley. So it's just a matter of investment in going. Now, if we were to get large in mRNA to the same kind of vision that we're talking about with proteins, we would need another factory the size we have now, so it would take some investment. But first things first, to make sure we have the science right. We'll get around the IP and we have working products and then we'll do what we need to do. Paul Knight : Yeah, okay, thanks. Operator : We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Chuck Kummeth for closing remarks. Chuck Kummeth : Well, thanks, everyone. It was a great start to our year. Love seeing over 20% organic growth as always. I'm sure you do as well. We look forward to next quarter and hopefully we can keep it all going. Thanks again. Bye. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation. Have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Bio-Techne Earnings Conference Call for the Second Quarter of Fiscal Year 2022. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to David Clair, Bio-Techne's Senior Director, Investor Relations and Corporate Development. David Clair : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me this morning are : Chuck Kummeth, Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Hippel, Chief Financial Officer of Bio-Techne. Before we begin, let me briefly cover our safe harbor statement. Some of the comments made during this conference call may be considered forward-looking statements, including beliefs and expectations about the company's future results, as well as the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and financial results. The company's 10-K for fiscal year 2021 identifies certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements made during this call. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements because of any new information or future events or developments. The 10-K as well as the company's other SEC filings are available on the company's website within its Investor Relations section. During the call, non-GAAP financial measures may be used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. Tables reconciling these measures to most comparable GAAP measures are available in the company's press release issued earlier this morning on the Bio-Techne Corporation website at www.bio-techne. com.  I will now turn the call over to Chuck. Chuck Kummeth : Thanks, Dave and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter conference call. The Bio-Techne team once again executed our global growth strategy at a high level, continuing the momentum from last quarter and the last fiscal year. We crossed an important milestone during Q2 as our trailing 12-month revenue exceeded $1 billion for the first time in the company's 44-year history. Our 17% second quarter growth rate reflects continued robust demand for our portfolio of high-quality products and unique analytical solutions, especially within the biopharma end user base. Within biopharma, our positioning with self and gene therapy customers continues to accelerate, with this end market growing north of 80% and our GMP proteins grew over 180%. Our portfolio of innovative reagents, tools and solutions remain incredibly well positioned to enable the biologics revolution currently underway as transformative technologies like cell and gene therapy, facial biology, and genetic and proteomic biomarkers drive research discoveries, the emergence of transformative diagnostics and therapies and ultimately impact better patient care and outcomes. I'm extremely proud of our team of scientists that continue to develop innovative technologies necessary to advance and enable next-generation diagnostics and therapeutics. This performance in Q2 was once again delivered with a focus on driving profitability as our adjusted operating margin increased 50 basis points sequentially to 38.3%. While the demand for human capital remains high and the pace of our own hiring to meet current customer demand and support our future growth programs remains challenging, we continue to make progress in adding talented people to our organization at all levels in each of our businesses. During the quarter, we filled several key open positions within our technical and commercial organizations. We are utilizing referral bonuses, career fairs as well as leveraging industry awards like our recent recognition in Inc. Magazine's inaugural list of best led companies to attract and retain talent. At the most senior level in our company, I'm very pleased to have Will Geist and Brenda Everson join our leadership team. Will is our new President of Protein Sciences and most recently served as Chief Operating Officer for Quanterix. Prior to that, Will held multiple leadership positions running large business units for Thermo Fisher Scientific. Will\u2019s transitioning into his new role from Dave Enzer who will be retiring in Q3. Brenda is our new Senior Vice President of Human Resources, with extensive experience successfully leading HR functions at large organizations, including 18 years at Apple. Brenda will be transitioning into renew role from Struan Robertson, who will also be retiring in Q3. The contributions of both Dave and Struan have made to the dynamic growth and culture of Bio-Techne over the past eight years have been immeasurable. And I wish him all the best in the retirement. It is largely due to the legacy created by Dave and Struan and the remainder of Bio-Techne's 2,700 strong employees that has enabled our company to attract such great talent to lead our businesses on to a decade of success. Now let's get to some of the specifics around Bio-Techne's spectacular business performance for the quarter, starting with our regions and end markets. We once again experienced global strength across the portfolio. China led all territories where the team delivered yet another quarter of organic growth above 20%. Close behind with the US growth also north of 20% and Europe was in the mid-teens. As I mentioned earlier, this growth was driven by a very strong BioPharma market as it has been for many quarters, and we don't see that momentum slowing down. Similar to Q1, academic growth was significantly lower than BioPharma, where Omicron-induced do shutdowns occurred over the holidays and lack of funding clarity impacted larger bulk orders. However, our daily run rate reagent demand from academic customers was strong for most of the quarter, indicating a healthy underlying academic research environment. We anticipate this relative low and academic growth will gradually accelerate the remainder of the calendar year as the Omicron peaks the size and the spending budget is finally passed in Congress. Now let's discuss the performance of our growth platforms, starting with Protein Sciences, where we delivered organic growth of 19% in the quarter. As I mentioned in my opening comments, we continue to experience broad acceptance of our innovative tools, reagents and analytical solutions to improve the efficiencies within the cell and gene therapy workflow. During the quarter, we initiated commercial availability of GMP proteins, manufactured in our state-of-the-art GMP protein manufacturing site and are now actively shipping to our customers from this facility. We will continue to expand the number of GMP proteins manufactured in this facility, focusing first on scaling the GMP proteins with the highest anticipated demand within our catalog of over 30 GMP protein. However, our cell and gene therapy business extends far beyond GMP proteins and includes serum and media for cell growth. Our non-viral gene editing technology as well as our cloud polymer-B-cell separation technology. In addition to uptake with our cell, our core cell and gene therapy products, we are experiencing a halo effect on several other Bio-Techne product lines, including our proteomic analytical tools and spatial biology franchises. We also continue to explore external opportunities to expand our cell and gene therapy offering in addition to our organic efforts. In December, we struck an agreement with St. Paul, Minnesota-based Wilson Wolf for a future investment and eventual acquisition of this rapidly growing company. As background, Wilson Wolf manufactures a GRx product line, a leading single-use cell culture device, which has enjoyed rapid adoption and is quickly becoming the cell and gene therapy industry standard for. bioreactors Wilson Wolf is a very synergistic fit with Bio-Techne with GRx cell culture devices requiring GMP proteins is a key input to scale immune cell growth. Terms of the agreement include the right to make a 20% ownership investment upon Wilson Wolf for each $92 million in trailing 12-month revenue or $55 million in EBITDA. This is followed by an agreement to fully acquire the company upon achieving $226 million in revenue or $136 million in EBITDA for an additional $1 billion, representing a total acquisition price of $1.26 billion. If these milestones are not reached by the end of calendar year 2027, Bio-Techne has the right to purchase Wilson Wolf at a set multiple of 4.4 times trailing 12-month revenue. As a reminder, Wilson Wolf along with Fresenius Kabi, are already biotech partners in a scale-ready cell and gene therapy joint venture. Today, Wilson Wolf annualized revenue is greater than $50 million and growing rapidly. We are looking forward to them hitting their milestones and eventually becoming official members of the Bio-Techne team. With all the excitement around cell and gene therapy opportunities, we haven't taken our eyes off the ball of the core of our company, RUO proteins and antibodies. Our core research use only protein antibody businesses continued to perform extremely well, growing double-digits in the quarter. Our broad catalog of RUO proteins is widely recognized as the industry-leading portfolio with our R&D Systems brand delivering the highest level of quality, bioactivity and lot-to-lot consistency. In fact, we created a category of research use cytokines more than 35 years ago and have amassed a catalog of over 6,000 proteins over this time frame, including several hundred that are exclusive to Bio-Techne. Our in-house expertise and broad offering in both proteins antibodies creates opportunities for Bio-Techne to participate broadly in emerging applications, including high-throughput proteomics and the development of engineered proteins and positions us to possibly expand into adjacent opportunities, including mRNA and plasma DNA manufacturing. Moving on to our proteomic analytical tools, where the team once again delivered robust growth across our portfolio of novel instruments and leading immunoassay solutions, our ProteinSimple branded instrument portfolio increased 25% as Biologics, Simple Western and Simple Plex all grew north of 20% in the quarter. Biologics once again led the way, growing over 30% year-over-year. Recall our biologics instruments, namely our Maurice platform, enable the identification, purity testing and charge analysis of proteins and bioprocessing. Maurice is also gaining traction in cell and gene therapy applications with its ability to characterize capsid proteins enabling AAV serotype identity and stability testing. Our fully automated Western blotting solution, Simple Western continues to gain acceptance within the research community as its ability to convert the messy, cumbersome and unreliable process of a manual western blood into a three-hour highly accurate push button process and continues to resonate, particularly with our biopharma customers. Simple Western is also gaining significant traction for cell and gene therapy applications with stem cell therapy, regenerative medicine, gene-modified cell therapy and gene therapy customers all using Simple Western for viral vector identification, purity testing, an empty versus full capsid detection. The recent launch of the stellar NIR/IR detection models for our just Simple Western system is a great example of enhancements we continue to deliver on this platform. Stellar fluorescence modules enable the detection of low abundance proteins and the multiplexing of multiple targets, including multicolor immunoassays alongside total protein staining within the same detection lane. Following the commercial availability of Stellar modules, just now offers low picogram sensitivity in both chemical luminescence and fluorescence channels. For Simple Plex, for Ella, we are also experiencing increased demand in the cell and gene therapy applications with the instrument increasingly being used to detect wholesale-related impurities. The Ella assay development road map remains very full with additional neurological biomarkers, cell and gene therapy, bioprocessing and immuno-oncology assays in the pipeline, layer the untapped clinical opportunity onto this rich assay pipeline, and we believe Ella remains in the early stages of reaching its potential. Now let's discuss the Diagnostics and Genomics segment, where organic revenue increased 6% for the quarter. Our spatial biology business, branded ACD, increased 10% in the quarter. While this growth is not up to our long-term expectations, it was a nice improvement over Q1, which was impacted by key open commercial positions, a higher exposure to a softer academic market and a tougher year-over-year comp. All those same headwinds remain in Q2. However, we did make progress in filling some of the open commercial positions and expect for continued progress in growth rates as new commercial team members on board and the academic environment improves. As a reminder, over recent quarters, we have expanded our spatial biology portfolio beyond RNA scope, adding kits for the visualization and quantification of DNA, microRNA, short RNA targets as well as higher plexing RNA capabilities. We are also very encouraged with the continued market traction we are experiencing with base school, a kit for the detection of short RNA targets, 50 to 300 basis, enabling the detection of splice variance to circular RNA and gene fusion. Our menu of probes is now greater than 50,000 targets over many species and publications that have almost crossed 5500, demonstrating the growing interest in this platform. Cell and gene therapy has also been a new market for our spatial biology business with ACD being used to track genes of interest in the cellular environment and determine the quantity of gene uptake in therapeutic cells. We recently announced a nonexclusive partnership with fellow spatial biology company, Akoya Biosciences, pairing our RNA scope HiPlex V2 assay for RNA imaging with Akoya's protein imaging assays to run on Akoya's phenocyclar fusion system. This single cell spatial multiomic workflow has potential to accelerate scientific understanding of human health and complex diseases like cancer, unlock new biomarker diagnostic signatures, improve patient stratification and ultimately improve treatment outcomes. We are excited about the automation of the RNAscope HiPlex V2 assay enabled by the Akoya partnership. Moving on to other parts of our diagnostics and genomics portfolio within our molecular diagnostics division. Our ExoDx prostate cancer test continued to make progress in the quarter, as patients returning to the doctors for routine checkups or followers, led to a strong improvement in diagnostic testing volumes. Q2 test volumes for ExoDx prostate cancer test returned to pre-pandemic volumes and have continued to increase year-over-year by strong double digits as we begin Q3. In addition to the ExoDx prostate test, we continue to advance our pipeline of innovative exosome-based diagnostic tests, including our noninvasive kidney transplant rejection assay, ExoTRU Kidney. As a reminder, ExoTRU is a noninvasive multigene urine-based liquid biopsy assay that provides critical, allograft health information to assist clinician decision-making in managing kidney transplant patients in optimizing patient care. We continue to work a dual pathway for the ExoTRU commercial launch, focusing on discussions with potential commercial partners and taking steps to prepare for potential commercialization on our own. With regards to the products with from the legacy surgeon business, our leading portfolio of genetic and oncology molecular diagnostic products, including our kits for FMR1 and BCR-ABL continue to gain market traction. During the quarter, we strengthened our genetic kit offering with the launch of the AMPODEX-PCRC-CFTR kit. Cystic fibrosis is a life-limiting autosomal recessive disease caused by variants in the CFTR gene. This research-use-only kit provides broader coverage of the diverse US population than any other commercially available targeted CFTR testing assay. Finally, our Diagnostics Reagents business delivered its tenth consecutive quarter of growth, with organic revenue increasing in the upper single digits. The pandemic-related headwinds that impacted this business in recent quarters continue to diminish, and we are experiencing a reacceleration in the chemistry, blood gas and hematology control product lines. Improving doctor office visit trends and the resulting diagnostic test volumes, combined with new product launches and additional penetration within existing OEM customers, position this business for sustainable growth going forward. In conclusion, the favorable trends we experienced in recent quarters continued in our Q2 as execution from the global team, favorable end market conditions and robust demand for our portfolio proteomic research reagents, analytical tools and molecular diagnostic products remain strong. Our cell and gene therapy initiatives are resonating with our biopharma customers. There's increasing demand for our GMP proteins, cell culture and media products are translating into demand across our portfolio, particularly for our protein simple branded proteomic and analytical solutions. We have our sights firmly focused on hitting our $2 billion 2026 revenue target and following the signing of the Wilson Wolf purchase agreement, I'm even more confident in our ability to deliver and potentially exceed this goal. With that, I'll hand the call over to Jim. Jim Hippel : Thanks, Chuck. I will provide an overview of our Q2 fiscal 2022 financial performance for the total company, provide some additional details on the performance of each of our segments and give some thoughts on the remainder of the fiscal year. Starting with the overall second quarter financial performance, adjusted EPS was a record $1.88 versus $1.62 one year ago, an increase of 16% over last year. Foreign exchange negatively impacted EPS by $0.04. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $1.94 compared to $1.15 in the prior year. The biggest driver for the increase in GAAP EPS, other than from business operations, was unrealized gains on our investment in ChemoCentryx. Q2 revenue was $269.3 million, an increase of 20% year-over-year on a reported basis and 17% on an organic basis. Acquisitions contributed 3%, and foreign exchange translation had an immaterial impact to revenue growth. From a geographic perspective, we experienced a strong and balanced performance with China and the US growing over 20% and EMEA increasing in the mid-teens for the quarter. The rest of the world grew in the upper-single-digits. By end market, biopharma remained very strong, growing 30%, while Academia increased low-single-digits year-over-year. Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin was 72.3% in the quarter compared to 71.5% in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by volume leverage and favorable segment mix. Adjusted SG&A in Q2 was 26.5% of revenue compared to 25.2% in the prior year, while R&D expense in Q2 was 7.5% of revenue, in line with the prior year. The increase in SG&A and R&D was due to the acquisition of a surgeon in the fourth quarter of last year as well as investments made to support our long-term strategic growth. The resulting adjusted operating margin for Q2 was 38.3%, an increase of - I'm sorry, a decrease of 50 basis points from the prior year period but an increase of 50 basis points over Q1. Excluding the impact of the Asuragen acquisition made last April, adjusted operating margin was in line with the prior year. Looking at our numbers below operating income, net interest expense in Q2 was $2.6 million, decreasing $0.8 million compared to the prior year. The decrease was due to a continued reduction of our bank debt. Our bank debt on the balance sheet as of the end of Q2 stood at $282.1 million. Other adjusted non-operating expense was $1.9 million for the quarter compared to $1.3 million expense in the prior year, primarily reflecting the foreign exchange impact related to our cash pooling arrangements. For GAAP reporting, other non-operating income includes unrealized gains from our investment in ChemoCentryx. Further down the P&L, our adjusted effective tax rate in Q2 was 21.4%. Turning to cash flow and return of capital. $101 million of cash was generated from operations in the quarter, compared to $89.3 million in the prior year quarter. In Q2, our net investment in capital expenditures was $10.2 million, and during Q2, we returned capital to shareholders by a way of $41.3 million in stock buybacks and $12.6 million in dividends. We finished the quarter with 41.2 million average diluted shares outstanding. Our balance sheet finished Q2 in a very strong position with $279 million in cash and short-term available-for-sale investments, bringing our net debt position to near zero. Next, I'll discuss the performance of our reporting segments, starting with the Protein Sciences segment. Q2 reported sales were $205 million, with reported inorganic revenue, both increasing 19% compared to the prior year. Within this segment, the strong growth was very broad-based in nearly all assay and instrument platforms. As Chuck mentioned, cell and gene therapy increased almost 80%, including growth of over 180% in our GMP protein products, while Biologics grew over 30%, Simple Western and Simple Plex both increased over 20% and proteins and antibodies all grew low double-digits. Operating margin for the Protein Sciences segment was 45.5%, a decrease of 120 basis points year-over-year due primarily to favorable volume leverage more than offset by the timing of strategic investments to support future growth. Turning to Diagnostics and Genomics segment, Q2 reported sales were $64.5 million, with reported revenue increasing 23%. Organic growth for the segment was 7%, with acquisitions contributing another 16%. The Diagnostics Reagents business increased upper single-digits, and the ACD-branded spatial biology portfolio improved sequentially, achieving double-digit year-over-year growth in the quarter. For Exosome Diagnostics revenue growth was hampered by the timing of companion diagnostic projects with big pharma, but importantly, prostate cancer test counts improved almost 30% compared to the prior year period, now surpassing pre-pandemic levels. We are encouraged with the volume trend and anticipate continued improvement as patients return to their physicians for checkups and our sales force gets more in-person interaction with the physician community. Moving on to the Diagnostics and Genomics segment, operating margin, at 16.9%, the segment's operating margin increased 140 basis points compared to the prior year. The increase reflects the favorable impact of volume leverage and product mix, partially offset by the impact of strategic investments to support future growth. In summary, our research-oriented end markets remain strong and the diagnostics end market continues to improve. As our Q2 performance shows, our research reagents and analytic tools remain in high demand, and we are executing extremely well in serving these markets. Our comps become increasingly more challenging in the second half of this fiscal year as they reflect the massive rebound that occurred last year from the COVID lows the year before. However, given our strong performance during the first half of our fiscal 2022, we have increasing confidence that we can achieve an overall organic growth rate in the mid-teens for the full fiscal 2022. That concludes my prepared comments. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Lisa to open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Puneet Souda with SVB Leerink. Please proceed with your question. Puneet Souda : Hi, Chuck, Jim, thanks for taking the question. So first one, really, I think Jim already covered some of that as really mid-teens growth that you expect here for the year despite the tougher comps. I just wanted to clarify, Jim, on the op margin side, given the hiring that's been somewhat delayed, how should we expect hiring to - how should we account for hiring through the year and op margin performance throughout the year within this context? Jim Hippel : We more or less expect the hiring to continue at the pace that it has been. But how that translates into adjusted operating margin? We said at the beginning of the year that we expected to end the year in Q4 at the same relative operating margin that we ended Q4 of last fiscal year, and we still see that as being the case. So that's really only about 50 basis points higher from where we ended Q2. So we see a continued gradual towards that mark. Puneet Souda : And on capital deployment, I just wanted to understand. Obviously, you have the new a $400 million buyback that you placed. Given - traditionally, Bio-Techne has prioritized growth M&A, and I think that continues to remain a priority. But just trying to understand how are you balancing that versus the buyback? If you could just walk me through the puts and takes this year? Chuck Kummeth : I'll take that, Puneet. So up to this point, we've been doing buybacks for stock option dilution, which is minor. And we've done 16, 17 acquisitions the last eight years, but we've never gone beyond two times leverage. We've never been able to. We've never done well in the public auctions, and we tend to do them with things more private and which tends to be more smaller. Currently, valuations still remain quite high, and they might be getting cheaper, but we'll wait a few months for settling until we even know that. But today, they're very high. So we thought that was - given the status of our stock price, we feel very undervalued. We thought it was probably appropriate our Board, especially to make that message and since we have an extra 2 or 2.5 that we never use anyway. So we've got - as Jim pointed out, we're net debt zero. It's time to act and do something here and put some leverage to work. Puneet Souda : Got it. That's super helpful. Chuck Kummeth : It's really important you guys understand that we're not changing our priority on our capital plan, still M& A. We - but us going to 3.5, 4 times leverage is probably not a high - not likely. So we've got room here. It's still number one though. Puneet Souda : Okay. Thanks for that. Yes. That makes sense. Chuck, a question that we've been getting from investors is about demand - in overall demand in GMP proteins and the recent acquisition in the space. As you saw, there was an acquisition of GMP cytokine manufacturer by one of your larger peers. Given the valuation paid for that asset, it appears that the interest is going to be likely going to be scaling of GMP proteins business and by that peer. So just wanted to understand, how do you see your competitive position now in that market and the overall demand you're seeing in that market with the one potential competitor scaling up as well? Thanks. Chuck Kummeth : Well, we think we're years ahead for starters. That entity hasn't been very up to date with their work, and they're like fourth or fifth on the list out there. So that's one issue. They don't have a lot of assets in place. Their expansion has been real slow. I mean, they've been trying to be sold for the last two years, they haven't been doing much. We have hundreds of proteins they can't even make. We think over time the drift in GMP proteins would be like - like the drift has been in RUO proteins and towards quality, lot consistency, bioactivity, et cetera. I think we'll be uniquely positioned in, say, 5, 10 years to probably have again, proteins that nobody else can even make more than likely. We're going to go well beyond the IL-10s and IL-15s, we think as this industry matures and people get smarter and use these proteins for different things. We just think that we're in the best position we have been. We've been at this for four years or five years now. And you can - I think the move on the Wilson Wolf even more than strengthens that because we'll be able to position full solutions to the industry, bioreactors that have proteins already embedded sterilely. So we're going to have novel innovative concepts to actually improve the whole cell and gene therapy workflow. And again, a new landlord for these guys, it's not going to help them. So they have no domain knowledge in the space beginning. So they all have money to help them with, but again, there are years behind us, we feel. Puneet Souda : Got it. Okay. Super helpful. And congrats on the Wilson Wolf deal, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Chuck Kummeth : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Arias with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Dan Arias : Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. Chuck, on GMP proteins and to your last point on scaling there, I'm just curious how many proteins that you make are driving the bulk of the demand? Is there like an 80-20 rule that we should think about? Or is it more diverse than that? And then relatedly, when you think about what's important over the next 12 months or so for growth, is it more a critical factor related to just scaling up the ones that you make now? Or is it expanding the menu? I mean, I'm sure it's both, but I'm just sort of looking for each one is a bigger lever on growth this year? Chuck Kummeth : Yes. Thanks for the question. It's a very good one. We started early trying to expand and have the largest breadth catalog in GMP protein. We went to beyond 50. We have now since moved that back to roughly 30, 35. There just isn't a lot of demand right now. It's a very embryonic nascent industry. And you're right, there's literally a dozen that are really being made and sold, and that's about it. We have got our first three totally launched in multiple lots, a lot consistency verified and in the middle of selling them and also having them audited by customers. These are the IL-7, 10, 15, 2 is coming. We have a vent coming soon. So we're going to go after first double in the first year or two years, probably. I doubt we'll ever scale across the board to 30, 40, 50 plus for probably years to come. I doubt anyone will. It will depend on how the industry - how that workflow matures and what they're looking for, I guess. The big deal for us, of course, for everyone, is to how to make how to make these and beyond an RUO fashion, so in lots that are sizable and then lot-to-lot consistency, which is near perfect. And that's where the focus has been. That's what we're good at the RUO level, and we've been able to replicate that now at an extreme multiple in lot size with this factory. And that's what we're known for. And that's what we think is going to differentiate us. And so far, the customer input and the audits have been stellar. They're blown away, quite frankly, what they see for the ability of our quality and lots - a lot consistently at the size of lots we can produce. They want to be assured that if they come out of clinicals, and they go into therapeutics, they can buy millions of dollars of a single protein in a near perfect consistency. And we're able to do that. Dan Arias : Yes. Okay, I appreciate that. And then maybe just on ACD. Can you just help us with how you see that business trending across the year? I mean, you had been pretty confident in a rebound. Last quarter, which I guess you saw a little bit of, but this quarter was slightly softer than what we were looking for, what I think you were looking for. So, number one, how much of what you saw in the quarter was related to sales force versus market factors? And then two, can you maybe help us with the landing zone for growth this year, just given that list in our model, this is kind of like one of the wing segments? Chuck Kummeth : Well, we were mid-single-digits last quarter, and we were double-digits. So we like the recovery, especially when taking into account that there was an Omicron factor. There is an academic tenancy to this franchise. There's a lot of academic customers and that was softer. The comp on top of that is near 30% and that's continuing for a while. So, as we go through the rest of this year and then last, of course, is the sales force, spatial biology is all the rage, right? There's a lot of - and we're the biggest business out there in it right now. So, guess for other up-and-comers target. But we've had - especially this business is located in the Bay Area, we've had some attrition. I mentioned that last quarter, we've covered over half of that back. We're in pretty good shape now. And the results reflect that, especially when you take in account comp and where Academia is a little bit softer still. And another even in that area have also mentioned the same kinds of market conditions. So, throughout the rest of the year, we see improvements, continued improvements. And we still have always said we've had brief periods of 20% and 30% growth. We've always said this is a 15% to 20% grower for many years. We still stand by that. I think we're on our way back to that, and we're not too worried to be honest. It's kind of on plan. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jacob Johnson with Stephens Inc. Please proceed with your question. Jacob Johnson : Chuck, a lot of focus on GMP proteins and understandably so. But I think in your opening comments, you mentioned serum and media as an opportunity cell and gene therapy market. Are those candidates for GMP manufacturing 1 day? And when could that occur? Chuck Kummeth : We're working on expanding our Atlanta facility for BME right now. We have exploding growth there, primarily because the market leader is kind of tripped recently and so we're finding out of business. So, we're expanding on that now. But yes, regular GMP media will be putting into the current GMP factory now proteins. We're going to probably do GMP antibodies and GMP media there. And probably in parallel, probably a little bit some here, some at the headquarters, but over the next year, we'll be getting all that online. We see that as a natural adjacency to GMP proteins and part of the workflow. So - and we're being asked. Customers are asking, why can't you do this, too? So - and we are selling some. It's just like we were doing GMP proteins in the last few years. We're doing all this in our research facility and kind of make do GMP type of quarters, we have to scale itself. So, the way to scale is to put it in our GMP factory where we have the room. Jacob Johnson : Thanks for that Chuck. And then maybe following up on Puneet's question on capital allocation. Chuck, I think you - that at some point last year that at some point, interest rates are going to rise and maybe multiples will come down and you would be ready to act. Obviously, we've seen some of this play out in the public markets. But do you think it's flowed through on the private side? And do you think you'll see more opportunities come to you as a result of this? Chuck Kummeth : Do you think in terms of M&A? Jacob Johnson : Yes, in terms of M&A. Chuck Kummeth : I mean I think every - humans are human. Nobody is going to take their current price of where it is today versus a month ago and say that's our value. I doubt anyone will, no matter what size of the company. So things have to settle out. And probably acquirers aren't going to be that, that mean anyway. They're probably going to wait as well, knowing it's probably foolish even try and just upset the target. But if interest rates go up, it affects your check treasury yield, it affects the DCS out there. The model they all come down, our too, if this is the new world that your shaving 10 points off their multiple, then we'll deal with it. But we'll deal with it effectively like we always have. During Trump, there was 2.5%, 3% interest rates, and we were carrying at times of 40 multiple. There is a flight to quality too. I mean we're a company that makes money, double-digit growth, stable unicorns. It's just - we're hoping that this will end up being a winner in all this when things do settle. Right now, I think we're all still in a bit of a don't-catch-a-falling-knife kind of scenario, right? So - but we know there's a lot of interest. There's a lot of - we get a lot of reasons our company for people to be interested and we'll be ready to capitalize and M&A as well. And believe me, I'm looking forward to acquiring things at a little better price tag as well. So Jim, do you want to add anything else? Jim Hippel : Yes. I think the only thing I would add would be that if anything, what it might do in make the environment more favorable for M&A is one of our big competitors in the past 1.5 years hasn't been other companies, it's been going IPO. And this volatility that we're experiencing now, particularly with the IPO market might make owners think twice about that being a viable option and make a private deal more accessible. Chuck Kummeth : To be honest, you actually had some inbound inquiries from potential targets that said they were more into an IPO and they've called back. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Patrick Donnelly : Thanks for taking the question. Chuck, maybe just to expand on some of the kind demand questions earlier on things like GMP. Obviously, people keep a pretty close eye on general biopharma funding and you kind of mentioned the IPO market, areas like that. Curious how you're feeling about kind of the sustainability of the demand, obviously, at your Analyst Day, talked about a few years of really strong growth from some of those high-growth more biologic areas. So just curious, if conversations have changed at all? Or do you still feel really confident sustainability of strength from some of those markets? Chuck Kummeth : I feel better ever. Can I say 180% growth one more time? Patrick Donnelly : Yes. Chuck Kummeth : It's - we're killing it. We can't keep up, and we can't get this off the ground fast enough. We're being throttled actually. And the most exciting thing you saw in the transcript, you put a lot of extra detail around the applications for cell and gene therapy from the rest of our portfolio. All the way - we're finding all our instruments are being - we're having an incredible growth. Biologics isn't supposed to be growing continue at 30%. We kept digging, why is this happening? It's being used in specked inferred cell and gene therapy applications. AAV purity and stuff. And on all 3 of our platforms are being specked in the cell and gene therapy applications going well beyond the TAMs that we are positioning these instruments for in the beginning. So yes, we see this being a juggernaut for years. And our $2 billion target out there in 2026, the largest component of that was cell and gene therapy. And guess what? It's just gotten a lot bigger when you add Wilson Wolf revenue to it. So it's going to be - it could be roughly half the company or more by then, which should take a well beyond $2 billion too. So ,yes. And the new things coming, we're definitely going to do media. We're definitely doing antibodies. We have more and more demand for antibodies that are being used in these areas as well. This halo effect is - it's broad. And it's because I think we did all the right things starting four years ago with doing more than a one-trick pony-type of approach. We have about 10 different products that can affect the workflow of cell and gene therapy. And then the things we couldn't get, we created the JV to give us more power in the channel and it's really working. Both of those entities Wilson Wolf and Fresenius are doing quite well. Patrick Donnelly : Okay. That's helpful. Yes. And then speaking maybe a sustainable growth. China has been a great spot for you guys, again, over 20% again this quarter in spite of maybe some minor dislocations with things like the rolling blackouts. Can you just talk about the strength there? And then again, expectations for that to continue as we go throughout this year and even next? Chuck Kummeth : China is - yes. China is rinse and repeat. It was 22%, and it's going to be there 2022, 25% in that range, we think, for some time. We'll cross $100 million this year, which is great for our company and for the size we're at, but it's only $100 million in China. So when we're out there at $2 billion plus as a company, it's going to be twice that or more. So I see nothing stopping the growth of China - unless - if the entire country shuts down and locks up and stuff there may be a momentary blip, but I don't - nothing is going to change the long term.  And the geopolitical things, too, just like before with - in the Trump era, all the product stoppages and stuff, it didn't affect us. We're the only game in town. They aren't local suppliers there. So if they want to do research in China, they're going to have to buy our stuff. They knew that, then they'll now continue going forward. So no issues. Patrick Donnelly : Okay. That's helpful. Maybe just a quick last one on Exo. You mentioned prostate at pre-pandemic level volumes, that's certainly encouraging. Can you just talk through, I guess, the catalyst set there over the next quarters in terms of payers coming on board and continuing to ramp the reimbursement side, what we should... Chuck Kummeth : Yes, sure. So we're something like 96 million lives total, and we're under 1 million for private payers. So we're continuing to grind away in private payers. We're seeing good growth. We've touched 3,500-or-so urologists, of which about 3/4 of our repeat purchasers. So we're not even one-third of the way through the domain of the doctors out there. So it's a continual issue. So we are now starting to ramp and go after. We're seeing these results without still expanding our sales force. We're just starting to get to that now. We have, as you know, a new leadership, a new team in place with Asuragen and it's already have an immediate effect. But we got to get at new putting more people on the street and going after with urologists. They forget fast and you've got to stay on to even be repeat purchasers. So we are now across 75,000 tests total sold. So it's not a surprise now. It's starting to become real and we're seeing the growth for it. But we did have a little bit reverse engines with Omicron, and we're not all the way back here with patients yet. It's coming, though. And again, it's, for sure, a $1 billion platform entirely. And that we're going to do a combination of things ourselves. We're going to have partnerships before anyone asks the ExoTRU program. We definitely are able to do it ourselves. We're talking NGS now, but we are very, very close to a very, very good partnership. And I actually feel very strong that we'll get it here. And if we don't get that one, we've got one or two others waiting in the wings for a shot, so a lot of interest in this platform. And a lot of interest in the other things we have on the drawing board that are already validated assays, things in blood as an example. So it's coming and this is the best quarter in well over a year for Exo. Patrick Donnelly : All right. Thanks Chuck. Look forward to some of those announcements. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Catherine Schulte with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Catherine Schulte : Thanks for the questions. I guess, first on your comments on the academic end market. Can you just quantify the impact Omicron has had on customer activity levels? And any regional differences that you're seeing there? Chuck Kummeth : Yes. I've got a very insightful question. So it isn't - we've had our academic ranged from flat to double digit. It depends on the product. It depends on the regions. We have some academic accounts are fully funded. They're multiyear grants, and there's no issue. Some are not, and they are waiting, and they're waiting on new grants. Some are pulling back because there's no budget yet and they're being careful. We've got all these answers back from our field people because we've dug in hard. The net-net of it all is roughly mid-single digits, maybe a little better than that, roughly like last quarter, but there was no doubt a significant impact from Omicron. They send people home longer than the time period over Christmas, and they haven't come back yet. And just like our own company, we brought people back and we send them all back home again. It's everywhere. So we're not worried. It's coming, right? And this is on top of some regions that are pretty good as well. And the overall macro environment looks good. And then the budget that was already passed in the house is 15%. You add $3 million - $3 billion on top for the ARPA and you've got - that's where you get the 21% number. It's going to be something - in double digits will be a great budget. But Congress a little late this year and getting stuff done as we all know, and they've got to get it done. We hear it's a February deadline, but we'll see. So I think we'll start seeing an uptick in the academic going forward. Even so, we've worked hard in this company mitigating academic risk. It's way smaller than our biopharma segments now. And with the result of biopharma, we are totally swapping out any effect from academia. This is by design, it\u2019s because of this very reason. So going forward, we're not too concerned. It's going to be - it's going to improve the rest of the year, academia. And hopefully, there BA2, variance is not a big deal, and we will get back to normality here by summer or at least get a few months off. And then I think you'll see quite a big snapback everywhere in academia, personally. Catherine Schulte : Okay, got it. And then with Will taking over the Protein Sciences segment, any changes in strategy or opportunities that you see there with the change in leadership? Chuck Kummeth : Well, there's only one Dave in there, and you'll be thoroughly missed, but I won't miss the sparring with them. He's got an edge to them, as we all know. Everyone knows Dave, but Will come with a great pedigree. He has very strong domain knowledge, if not stronger than Dave's in biology. So for us, that's really critical that our leadership here understands science all the way up and down. He's been here a few weeks. He's still residing in California, but he's had a great start. And I just - with quite a long search. We spent a couple of years looking for the right individual for Dave's in retirement, and I think we found them. Catherine Schulte : Okay. Thank you. Chuck Kummeth : We have not made any changes yet. It won't be long. I'll ask for something they all do. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Nowak with Craig-Hallum Capital Group. Please proceed with your question. Alex Nowak : On Wilson Wolf, I think we all understand how strong of a company that is. But I guess what risk do you see in that direct bioreactor business from being the rocket ship that it could be? Just figuring out what could go wrong as you're on track to buy that business? Chuck Kummeth : I think, by far, the biggest risk is you've got John Wilson, who is more of an R&D scientist type of KOL collaborator than an operations guy. So, him not finding a partnership somewhere, getting beyond $100 million of these guys tend to run a trouble growing the company beyond that level. So they're right down the street, they're already integrated because of scale ready JV already. So I've known him for over a decade, and tried buying first time Thermo Fisher 14 years ago. We've been friends ever since. I think this thing is with a customer base of 800, he has, I think, over 20 customers that have already - already over $1 million of annual purchases. There isn't anything out there even remotely close to his level of clinical integration, I don't think, anywhere from anybody. So this is the de facto standard of the future. Are there new ways to do this? Are there going to be copycats? Are there going to be copy cats? Are there going to be people doing crazy new things with bags and stuff? Sure. But the beautiful thing about GRx and it's the way it works, and it's hard wall surface. It's really, really gentle on T cells and NK cells like it. So there are a lot of people chasing this technology with bioreactors that simply aren't going to be - they're going to work very well for T cells and for NK cells, just in fact being. So John learned this years ago. And so he's got a head start. We're not going to let them fail for sure. And - it's a marvelous business. It's growing like crazy. He's got a great team. They work with our great team here. And I've been waiting years for this, to be honest. So we're ecstatic. Alex Nowak : Yes. No, that's great. And then just going back to China, saw the Eminence impairment in the P&L. Just curious what happened there if that impacts China on a go forward or at least in the next couple of quarters? Chuck Kummeth : Well, it's China. We have a lot of cash in China. We took a swing. We know media is going to be big. We looked at two other entities, and we walked away from. We didn't think the management was stable. We picked this one. Guess what? The management wasn't stable. So it's at a point where we're definitely going to do the write-down. We got it more than covered, it's really immaterial. It's not all a loss. There's liquidation. There's assets. We've got a nice spot in the business park there. So there's - there's way to regroup. But at this point, all we can say is that we're just taking the next step of the responsible thing we need to do with the impairment, and then we'll go from there and let you know more later as we see what our options are with that small assets. Alex Nowak : Okay. Chuck Kummeth : As a reminder, Alex, our results that we report for China don't include anything from Eminence, right? So it has a material impact on our growth in China. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of [Mike Rowe] with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, Chuck, just following up on the Wilson Wolf., I mean, in your due diligence, do you think that the current operations there that they have the capacity and then the kind of expertise to reach that $100 million level? Chuck Kummeth : Can I give you a dollar for asking that? I can - you just wouldn't believe what he did at the site. He bought a 100,000 square foot site and it's - he bought over a year, a year-and-a-half of supplies early on for the supply chain risk. Even they're all-in, he decked out facility for his people, it's beautiful. And you can still park a couple of airliners in there with the empty space. It's - there\u2019s - its just a wonderful positioning. So we're not worried at all. I think, if I had to guess - I don't know for sure, I don't want to get too crazy, but it would scale many multiples of their current revenue rate, I'm sure. Unidentified Analyst : And then just, I guess, following up on a couple of the questions around GMP proteins. Are customers coming to you knowing exactly what they want, whether it's IL-2, IL-5 or what other IL protein there is? Chuck Kummeth : Yes. Unidentified Analyst : Or is it more of a consultative process? And given your experience in the industry and your work with other customers in this space, are you really driving customers to the best protein for their process? Chuck Kummeth : Yes. Another great question. So the answer is mixed here. One, we talked about - we have a lot of interest and a lot of our products are actually going into regenerative medicine as well as cell and gene therapy. So that is a very collaborative effort with the customer at our site. So we are doing other kinds of proteins as well. And I mentioned [Indiscernible] is one example. But in terms of the classic T-cell type of work going on for clinicals, we're not the first of the game. You've got Meltani and, CellGenix out there right now in most of the clinicals, right? And we're coming up fast. So these customers come to us looking for equivalency, looking for a U.S. supplier, looking for R&D systems brand lot to lot consistency and they want to do equivalency testing. So they already know what they want, and they're what you'd expect. They're the IL-2 710, 715s to start, of which - and by the way, a learning for us, you need like all - three out of the four at least really get people seriously doing equivalently because no one is using just one. They're using two or three of these, and they don't want to do also the effort on just one when they - and they can't get all three. So we're just getting started into that now, because we really - we've been open for a few months, but now we're just at the point of working on our fourth one for inventory. So we're at that level of now getting serious lot equivalency. Does that make sense? Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Kummeth for any final comments. Chuck Kummeth : Okay. Well, thanks all for attending the call. We really love being a $1 billion company and we're on our way to $2 billion and well - with a great quarter, and we think we have some more ahead of us here. So we'll talk to you next quarter. Thanks. Bye. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

The machine-assisted output provided is partly edited and is designed as a guide.: Operator : 00:04 Good morning, and welcome to the Bio-Techne Earnings Conference Call for the Third Quarter of Fiscal Year 2022. At this time, all participants have been placed in listen-only mode and the call will be opened for questions following management's prepared remarks. During our Q&A session, please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. 00:24 I would now like to turn the call over to David Clair, Bio-Techne's Senior Director, Investor Relations and Corporate Development. Please go ahead, sir. David Clair : 00:34 Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me this morning are Chuck Kummeth, Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Hippel, Chief Financial Officer of Bio-Techne. 00:42 Before we begin, let me briefly cover our safe harbor statement. Some of the comments made during this conference call may be considered forward-looking statements, including beliefs and expectations about the company's future results, as well as the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and financial results. 01:05 The company's 10-K for fiscal year 2021 identifies certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements made during this call. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements because of any new information or future events or developments. The 10-K as well as the company's other SEC filings are available on the company's website within its Investor Relations section. 01:31 During the call, non-GAAP financial measures may be used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. Tables reconciling these measures to most comparable GAAP measures are available in the company's press release issued earlier this morning on the Bio-Techne Corporation website at www.bio-techne.com. 01:50 I will now turn the call over to Chuck. Chuck Kummeth : 01:54 Thanks, Dave and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter conference call. The Bio-Techne team once again delivered outstanding results across segments and geographies with 17% organic growth, continuing the momentum from the first half of fiscal 2022 into our third quarter. Demand from our biopharma end market remains strong, particularly in cell and gene therapy, where our workflow solutions and GMP proteins continue their fantastic growth trajectory. 02:19 Other notable growth drivers in the quarter included our biologics instruments, as well as our best-in-class portfolio of research reagents and assays. Additionally, our prostate cancer test ExoDx Prostate had a record volume quarter as the urologist offices continued the reopening process and we gained increased mindshare in the benefits of this novel diagnostic offering. 02:42 Once again, this performance was delivered with a focus on profitability, leading to a 130 basis point sequential increase in our adjusted operating margin of 39.6%. On the human capital front, Bio-Techne received two important awards during the third quarter. First, Bio-Techne was selected as one of the 500 mid-sized companies on the Forbes 2022 list of America's Best Employers. Additionally, we were included on the Forbes 2022 list of Best Employers for Diversity. These awards are testament to the epic culture and workplace we've built at Bio-Techne and I am proud of the team for these achievements. 03:15 Awards and recognition like these, as well as targeting employee recruitment and retention strategies are fortifying our efforts to build the team necessary to support our future growth plans. I am pleased to report that we filled several key positions in the company during the quarter, including key business, technical, operational and commercial roles. We are still behind our original hiring plan for the year, but I am encouraged with the progress we made in the quarter. 03:38 Given the state of the global supply chain, let me briefly discuss our operations. Once again, the team did an incredible job effectively managing our supply chain. I am pleased to report that we have had -- not had any supply chain related issues that impact our ability to fulfill our customer orders. Also, we continue to leverage our strategic pricing model across our portfolio to combat inflationary pressures on the business. As you can see from our margin performance in the quarter, these strategies are bearing fruit and we are leveraging our value proposition to offset rising labor and other costs in the business. 04:09 Now let\u2019s discuss specifics around our trade performance this quarter, starting with our geographies and end markets. China continued with its banner year delivering over a 30% organic growth in the quarter. This is just tremendous execution by our China commercial team, especially considering the COVID related lockdowns that took hold late in the quarter in Shanghai. As these lockdowns are still currently being enforced, it is difficult to predict what the temporary impact would be for Q4. The impact of these lockdowns to date are primarily on our recurring research reagent business that is dependent on researchers being at the bench to run experiments. 04:41 In the end, our China team will persevere just as they did in the early days of the pandemic two years ago, when they outperformed all of their peers. And there will likely be a spike of demand when the lockdowns are over, and researchers are trying to catch up on their projects. It is also important to mention that we have minimal supply chain and manufacturing exposure in China, so we anticipate any impact on the shutdowns, to be isolated to this geography. Meanwhile our growth across the rest of the Globe continue to be strong. We experienced robust growth in the U.S. where our business increased in the high-teens as well as in Europe where we experienced upper-single digit organic growth. 05:17 From an end market perspective, Global sales to our biopharma customers remains very strong increasing nearly 20% for the quarter. Meanwhile Academia markets started to improve growing mid-single digit as the latest COVID pandemic wave started to wane, and there was more clarity on NIH funding with the federal budget in place. 05:35 Now let\u2019s discuss our growth platform, starting with the Protein Sciences segment, where we grew 16% organically in the quarter. During the quarter, we continued to further our cell and gene therapy strategy as our portfolio of proteomic reagents, technologies and analytical tools continue to deliver the cost-effective solutions needed to push these therapies forward. During the quarter, we increased the number of commercially available GMP proteins manufactured in our state-of-the-art GMP protein manufacturing facility, adding two high-quality, a lot to lot consistent GMP proteins with the scale and capacity to meet current and anticipated demand. 06:07 I would also like to highlight the strong performance of our cell culture portfolio, particularly from our Cultrex line of Basement Membrane Extract, BME. Matrix products which act as scaffolds for the growth of organoid cell structures induced pluripotent stem cell expansion and other 2D and 3D cell culture applications. All in, our portfolio of cell and gene therapy workflow solutions increased over 40% in the quarter with both GMP proteins and cell culture specifically growing well ahead of this rate. 06:36 Once again, demand from our cell and gene therapy customers created a halo effect across our portfolio driving incremental demand of our proteomic analytical tools and spatial biology solutions. We are incredibly well positioned to benefit across our portfolio as research continues in this area and the rich funnel of these next-generation therapies progress through the regulatory approval process. 06:57 Next, I want to provide an update on Wilson Wolf. As a reminder, Wilson Wolf is a manufacturer of the GRx line of single-use devices, which are quickly becoming an industry standard for fast, easy and cost effective cell therapy scaling solution. In our second fiscal quarter 2022, we entered into an agreement with Wilson Wolf where Bio-Techne can make a 20% ownership investment followed by full acquisition of the company upon achievement of certain milestones. 07:20 I'm very pleased to report that Wilson Wolf made continued progress in achieving in the trailing 12 months $92 million revenue or $55 million EBITDA milestone, which will trigger our initial 20% investment. Wilson Wolf exited the quarter at a $72 million revenue run rate as they continue to execute on their growth plan and approach this important milestone. 07:41 Now let's discuss our core research use only or RUO proteomic reagents, including our industry-leading portfolio of RUO proteins and antibodies. Here our growth was also fantastic with these reagents growing at a 20% in the quarter. Researchers continue to rely on our catalog of over 6,000 R&D systems branded proteins for the highest quality bioactive and lot-to-lot consistent proteins on the market. 08:03 Our R&D systems and Novus branded antibodies also continue to deliver the reliable and consistent performance needed by researchers globally and are increasingly being selected as a content to enable the emerging class of next-generation proteomic technologies. 08:16 Moving on to our proteomic analytical tools, which includes our Simple Western, Simple Plex, and biologics instruments, as well as our leading portfolio of immunoassay solutions. Our ProteinSimple branded instruments and consumables increased mid-teens in the quarter. This growth is particularly impressive considering the prior year comparison where ProteinSimple increased over 50%. 08:36 Once again performance of our biological instrument namely Maurice led the way increasing over 30% for the sixth consecutive quarter. Maurice is easy to use, cartridge based format simplifies protein characterization and charge analysis delivering the ideal tool for our biopharma customers. The Maurice results reflect ongoing traction within CRO, CDMO as well as cell and gene therapy end markets. We believe we are taking share not only from competing systems but also converting accounts from high-performance liquid chromatography where HPLC or Maurice offers comparatively higher quality data as well as labor and time savings. 09:14 Our Simple Western portfolio our fully automated western blot solutions continues to penetrate the large manual Western blot market opportunity as a reproducibility and time savings value proposition continues to resonate within our end markets. We are also seeing building interest in the platform for applications that go beyond traditional Western blotting, including cell and gene therapy, protein degradation and even the support of dose response curve. As a reminder, we introduce the Stellar kits for our Jess Simple Western platform in January. These kits enable the detection of low abundance proteins while multiplexing, multiple analyze within the same detection lane. 09:50 In the first partial quarter since launch Stellar Detection kits surpassed legacy Fluorescent detection kits and contributed to a record quarter for Simple Western consumables. We continue to develop new cell and gene therapy applications for the Simple Plex or Ella multiplexing immunoassay system. For example, Bio-Techne and Cygnus Technologies as a part of Maravai life sciences recently announced the launch of the Simple Plex HEK 293 HCP 3G assay for automated process and purity testing on the Ella immunoassay platform. Purification of viral particles to minimize whole cell protein contaminants is a crucial part of the viral production workflow in cell and gene therapy applications. 10:28 The Ella assay development roadmap remains very full with additional neurological biomarker, cell and gene therapy, bioprocessing and immuno-oncology assays in the pipeline, layer the untapped clinical opportunity onto this rich assay pipeline and we believe Ella remains in the early innings of reaching its potential. 10:45 Now let\u2019s discuss the Diagnostics and Genomics segments, where organic growth increased 19% for the quarter. Our spatial biology business branded ACD, remains a largest spatial biology business globally as our highly sensitive biomarker identification technology with single cell detection resolution and quantification capabilities continues to enable the transition from discovery to translational research. Spatial biology increased upper-single digits in the quarter as a soft academic market and a challenging year-over-year comp weighed on performance. Encouragingly, we made progress fortifying our North American commercial team with all our one key sales territory now field. 11:22 We augmented our commercial efforts with a full slate of conferences, including a presentation at the U.S. and Canadian Academy of Pathology or USCAP Conference, as well as the presentation of two posters at the American Association for Cancer Research or AACR meeting and we have a full slate of upcoming conferences, including ASGCT and AGBT. With our sales territories largely occupied a growing presence on the conference circuit to build awareness and expectations for the academic market to improve following NIH budget clarity, we are expecting steady improvement in our spatial biology growth rates in the upcoming quarters. 11:57 Moving onto our Molecular Diagnostics division, let's start with the significant progress our Exosome Diagnostics business delivered in the quarter. ExoDx Prostate or the EPI test benefited from increasing traffic to the physician office for initial or follow up visits, which in turn drove improving diagnostic testing volumes, including PSA test, which is a prerequisite for our EPI test. This improving physician office environment combined with our digital and traditional marketing initiatives drove over 50% year-over-year for ExoDx Prostate test volume growth as testing levels represented a quarterly record. We have several initiatives in place to build on this momentum including renewal of our Fight Like Cal marketing campaign with Baseball Hall of Famer Cal Ripken Jr. 12:38 As a reminder, Cal Ripken Jr took the EPI test and opted for a biopsy based on his results, enabling the discovery of his aggressive prostate cancer in its early stages. Mr. Ripken will be an active component of our live presentations at the upcoming American Urology Association Conference and our ongoing digital marketing initiatives. During the quarter, we continued to publish data supporting the value ExoDx Prostate delivers to men in their prostate cancer journey. A publication in the World Journal of Urology demonstrated the utility of the ExoDx Prostate test to address limitations related to prostate biopsy sampling year, prostate biopsy bias as well as multifocality of the disease with a study suggesting that the test can be used in decision for active surveillance and enabling them to avoid unnecessary radical prostatectomy. 13:26 Separately, we announced an agreement with Thermo Fisher Scientific to exclusively complete the development of and commercialize the ExoTRU kidney transplant or rejection assay. ExoTRU is an non-invasive multi-gene urine based liquid biopsy assay that provides critical allograft information to assist clinical decision-making in managing kidney transplant patients and optimizing care for these patients. Financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed, but include payments for achieving various milestones, as well as an ongoing royalty. The first milestone payment related to a successful technology transfer to Thermo Fisher Scientific was achieved in the quarter. 14:02 The legacy assured in portfolio of leading carrier screening and oncology diagnostic kits continue to gain market traction, including several evaluations of the recently launched AmplideX CFTR kit enabling broad coverage of the gene variant linked to cystic fibrosis. Additionally, we have positioned the business to increase its penetration of the largely untapped European markets adding to and leveraging our commercial presence in this geography. In addition to the geographic expansion, the Asuragen\u2019s pipeline remains full and is positioned for strong growth in the quarters and years to come. 14:35 Finally, our diagnostic reagents business continued its trend of steady growth in the quarter. The return of patients to the doctors' office is sparking demand for hematology, coagulation and clinical chemistry test, which is driving demand for our clinical controls and reagents. Improving patient office visits trends a full pipeline and opportunities to additional share gains within our OEM partners set the stage for sustainable growth in our diagnostic reagents business going forward. 14:59 In conclusion, we are incredibly well positioned for the Proteomics evolution that is in the initial stages of unfolding, with high demand for our content rich research reagents and highly sensitive yet is simple to use analytical tools that move our customers discoveries forward. Our cell and gene therapy initiatives continue to resonate with our biopharma customers with increasing demand for our GMP proteins, cell culture media products translating into growth across our entire portfolio. 15:26 Given Wilson Wolf current growth trajectory, the pathway to our initial 20% investment stake and eventual acquisition is accelerating. Our diagnostic strategy is gaining momentum, as testing volumes continue to improve with a proven ability to find partners that can help drive our next disruptive exosome based test forward. I am proud of the team's Q3 accomplishments and look forward to continued execution against our long-term strategic goals. 15:50 With that, I'll hand over to Jim. Jim Hippel : 15:52 Thanks, Chuck. Starting with the overall third quarter financial performance. Adjusted EPS was a record $2.14 versus $1.81 year ago, an increase of 19% over last year. Foreign exchange negatively impacted EPS by $0.03. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $1.48 compared to $1.12 in the prior year. Q3 revenue was $290.4 million, an increase of 19% year-over-year on a reported basis and 17% on an organic basis. Acquisitions had a favorable 3% year-over-year impact and foreign exchange translation had an unfavorable impact of 1% to revenue growth. 16:30 From a geographic perspective, China led all geographies growing over 30% followed by the U.S. increasing in the upper teens, and EMEA increasing in the upper-single digits for the quarter. The rest of the world grew in the mid-single digits. By end market biopharma remained very strong growing nearly 20%, while Academia increased mid-single digits year-over-year. 16:51 Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin was 73.2% in the quarter compared to 73% in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by favorable business mix, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange. Adjusted SG&A in Q3 was 26.1% of revenue compared to 25.6% in the prior year, while R&D expense in Q3 was 7.5% of revenue compared to 7.0% in the prior year. The increase in SG&A and R&D was due to the acquisition of Asuragen in the fourth quarter of last year, as well as investments made to support our long-term strategic growth. 17:30 The resulting adjusted operating margin for Q3 was 39.6%, a decrease of 80 basis points from the prior year period, but an increase of 130 basis points over Q2. Excluding the impact of the Asuragen acquisition made last April and the impact of foreign exchange, adjusted operating margin was in line with the prior year. Looking at our numbers below operating income. Net interest expense in Q3 was $2.2 million, decreasing $0.2 million compared to the prior year period. The decrease was due to a continued reduction of our bank debt. 18:00 Our bank debt and the balance sheet as of the end of Q3 stood at $259 million. Other adjusted net operating expense was $1.1 million for the quarter compared to $4.3 million expense for the prior year, primarily reflecting the foreign exchange impact related to our cash pooling arrangements. For GAAP reporting, other non-operating income includes unrealized losses from our investment in ChemoCentryx. 18:27 Moving further down the P&L, our adjusted effective tax rate in Q3 was 21.2%. Turning to cash flow and return of capital $73.1 million of cash was generated from operations in the quarter and our net investment in capital expenditures was $15.1 million. Also during Q3 return capital to shareholders by a way of $60.8 million in stock buybacks and $12.5 million in dividends. We finished the quarter with $41 million average diluted shares outstanding. Our balance sheet finished Q3 in a very strong position with $231.2 million in cash and short-term available for sale investments keeping our net debt position negligible. 19:07 Next, I'll discuss the performance of our reporting segments, starting with the Protein Sciences segment. Q3 reported sales were $213.2 million with reported revenue increasing 15%. Organic growth for this segment was 16% with foreign exchange having unfavorable impact of 1%. Within the segment, the growth was very broad-based in nearly all reagent assay and instrument platforms. As Chuck mentioned, cell and gene therapy increase over 40%, our RUO proteomics research reagents grew nearly 20% and our ProteinSimple branded instruments and consumables increased in the mid-teens on very tough comps. 19:42 Operating margin for the Protein Sciences segment was 45.4%, a decrease of 250 basis points year-over-year with favorable volume leverage more than offset by strategic investments to support future growth and to a lesser extent the impact of foreign exchange. 19:59 Turning to the Diagnostics and Genomics segment. Q3 reported sales were $77.7 million with reported revenue increasing 34%. Organic growth for the segment was 19% and the Asuragen acquisition from last year contributed 15% to growth. Within this segment, the Diagnostics Reagents business increased mid-single digits and the ACD branded spatial biology portfolio delivered upper-single digit growth in the quarter. With increased clarity on academic funding and a sales force as it approaching fully staffed, we anticipate improved growth rates in our Spatial Biology segment going forward. 20:34 For Exosome Diagnostics, revenue growth accelerated as prostate cancer test counts -- as prostate cancer test counts increased over 50% compared to the prior year period, representing a quarterly test volume record. We are encouraged with the volume trend and anticipate continued improvement as our marketing strategy and value proposition resonates with physicians and patients. As Chuck mentioned, we earned initial milestone payment related to the ExoTRU kidney rejection test track -- technology transfer to Thermo Fisher Scientific, in which the financial details of our agreement were not disclosed. 21:08 Moving on to the Diagnostics and Genomics segment. Operating margin at 25% -- 25.0%. The segment's operating margin increased 710 (ph) basis points compared to the prior year. The increase reflects the favorable impact of volume leverage and product mix including the milestone payment for ExoTRU. 21:27 In summary, the growth momentum across our business remains consistently strong. Using the fiscal year \u201819 as a pre-COVID baseline, the company's revenue growth CAGR excluding the impact of acquisitions, FX and milestone payments has been in the low to mid-teens every quarter for the past 7. As Chuck stated in his closing comments, we believe that we are still in the early stages of the initial stages of a proteomics revolution and is ahead of us in the life sciences industry. And our best-in-class research tools and cell and gene therapy enablers are positioned to be leaders in this revolution for years to come. Layer onto this in emerging Diagnostics and Genomics portfolio that remains in the early stages of realizing its true potential and we are incredibly well positioned to deliver long-term strategic growth objectives. 22:15 That concludes my prepared comments. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Maria to open the line for questions. Operator : 22:20 Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dan Arias with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Dan Arias : 23:02 Good morning, guys. Thanks for the questions. Chuck, can you just talk a little bit more about the scale up in GMP proteins, whereas demand highest, how is it evolving and then what you need to do on your end at the end of the year into the end of the year? And then for the outlook there, you've talked pretty consistently about that piece of the business being on this trajectory where revenues can double for a few years, you're tracking ahead of the initial revenue expectations there? So does the outlook for the doubling still hold on what looks like it will be just a higher base for 2022? Chuck Kummeth : 23:33 Sure. Well, we launched a two new proteins, which is, it's only two, but we only had two or three before that so, it's a big percentage increase. These of course are -- its a short catalog for doing proteins for GMP as you know. We have 40-ish or so on the market total and most companies our competitors have less than a dozen. So very different RUO. The difference of course as we can make them in, at the gram level even. So, lots and lots at a very, very high quality state and very lot-to-lot consistent. The growth rate while under 100%-ish this quarter, we were over 40 for the category and we are just under 100% for proteins this quarter. We\u2019ve been above 100 every quarter before. We will end the year over 100% probably at the way it looks. And are right around 100 at the very least, I think that's pretty safe. 24:45 And we told you, it would be about that, and it should be about that all year, and next year should be the same again. From that point on, we hope to accelerate as we get into more and more down the road with more clinicals. We get more and more pull-through with GRx with Wilson Wolf, who has a lot more customers than we do and have involved in a lot more clinical. And as we work towards what we call the Holy Grail here, when we can, or we'll be doing media at some point here, along with a very, very high quality version of our proteins that can be supplied within GRx to the customer in a sterile environment, so consider it all like self and closed, a closed loop which would be the only one in the market they can do that, we think. That's a year or so away, but that's what we're after, and that's should really help accelerate even more growth. 25:15 On top of all that, this is all cell and gene therapy, but we're also seeing explosive growth for our GMP proteins in regenerative medicine as well, so we've got a lot of customers that are scaling up around regenerative and that's equally exciting to us. Since another large area, we don't talk much about, but it's growing so much now and we've got so much more activity, we're probably going to start talking about it. So we've got additional growth levers and that might help explain why we've been, well north of 100% growth all year and for the last couple of years to be honest. I think that addresses, most you said. Dan Arias : 25:46 Got it. Thank you. And then maybe just on ACD, it looks like there were some sequential deceleration in that business from 2Q levels and you're averaging something in I guess like the high singles for the year, and that's down from at least in my model like 30% plus in 2021. So is the hiring that you did really the key there and once, now that you have the sales reps in and presumably functional in the market. What do you think that the run rate growth can be like going forward there? Chuck Kummeth : 26:15 Well, the other -- well, the other two components around from head count, of course, are the comp, super high comp from last year, as well as the academic reopening. So everything's coming together at once, along with a full sales force again. We're only we're only down one. Even one important, so this is not a huge sales force, but we're back to, would say, full strength, and it will come on strong now. We should be back to double-digit or higher here. I think this quarter, we were pretty close to double-digit this quarter anyway, but we're getting there. It's pretty key now that, we got funding kind of out there and open now for academia that come back is going to happen. The comps get much easier going forward, that's also given. And while we are pretty strong, the U.S., it was softer in Europe and Europe is kind of lumpy back and forth and where we see that picking up as well. We're also positioning some more support and more help in Europe to help them and all bodes well, but we still see this is a 15% to 20% growth platform going forward. And we're in the early innings. We have a new team to high level in the team, so all the way to the VP run the Division, Head of R&D is fairly new. And they are just hitting their stride now ready. So that's also going to help. Operator : 27:33 Our next question comes from Puneet Souda with SVB Securities. Please proceed with your question. Puneet Souda : 27:42 Yeah. Hi, Chuck. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the solid print here. First one, maybe for EU and Jim both when we look at the top line here, you obviously seeing incredible growth here in the Exosome Diagnostics with the recovery, protein segments continues to do well. You mentioned, are you a protein, cell and gene therapy, Maurice, Simple Plex and I mean just across the board portfolio seems to be working. I mean I hear you on the comments, but just help us understand how should we be thinking about the sort of the top line as we go into fiscal year 2023. Is mid-teens that is still the right way to sort of think about this given the acceleration here and potential pickup from cell and gene therapy as well? Chuck Kummeth : 28:32 Yeah, all hear. As you know, we don't give quarterly guidance, we give annual targets. And we've given targets all year, that we should be in the mid-teens for the year and I think we're close enough for you guys can see we're going to be in that range for sure. Real question is, can it be 17 and 19 . I think we have to wait in a couple of things. China might have a minor impact in Q4, could cure Q4, but it wouldn't hurt any more of that. Going to next year, its mid-teens and up, and I think it comes off first a strong layer of momentum off our reagents. I mean we're at 20% growth in our proteins and antibodies. We are taking share everywhere. We're in double-digit growth in our assays. 29:02 We're in over 30% growth in our Luminex line. We're number two in Luminex now, whoever thought that would have happened. So we're not going -- out of the park on the core. And as long as that core stays with the momentum we're seeing, which we do, then it's a mid-teens and up and then the accelerator from there of course is how do these smaller segments how do they scale and they've got the higher growth rate cell impact the overall portfolio, so number one again cell and gene therapy and on a $70 million run rate growing at 30%, 40% next year as a category that's going to start having a bigger impact. 29:48 ExoDx is getting really interesting now. So we had a record quarter on tests. We're already seeing a big impact with the Cal Ripken campaign. We didn't really get a fair shake in that being, we went into that rate in the month of the pandemic, and it's been amazing interest. I can't wait to get AAU myself and meet Cal and we're going to do some things together there and we're expecting a big year going forward. 30:10 And ExoTRU, we are working on the next thing now because we've got a great partner. We worked hard. This partner is actually blown our socks off. They\u2019re almost doing a great job. They are ahead of our skies, they are pushing us to get the Tech transfer done quicker than we thought they would. They paid us, it a good number. We didn't lay it out. We've got more deals to do, so we didn't want to talk about those numbers, but we had solid -- with solid result without the extra payment to be honest. Anyway, so I think that's the future. I think it's all about staying with the momentum in the core, solid execution which we're doing, what's also helping this whole baseline momentum in our core is our digital backbone and it\u2019s just keeps getting better and better. 30:52 We've got our one Bio-Techne needs site up and running. We had something like 80%, 90% attraction rate to that website as we start migrating a lot of smaller sites into the ones, so we can have one-stop shopping experience for customers which you\u2019ve been asking for years. That's all coming together great . We are doing a great job measuring our customers online and helping them with their purchasing decisions in real time and that's working. Our [indiscernible] spend continues to grow and continues to give us fabulous payback. So already all parts of run the company along with the innovation side are really doing well. 31:32 As you know, we've a Tech Council that we've -- we put all these top scientists of all our divisions together. They\u2019ve virtually every month and working on new platforms together. And there is an incredible pipeline. That we do have an extensive prioritization process here we just concluded that process takes us three or four months, it helps us roll into our budget plan for next year. And we analyzed 400 different work streams in this company, of which we knew figured out where the draw line and we've never had a bigger pipeline of new to the world innovation in this past year, things are -- now we're reaching the size of a company where we're really getting a good a collaborative impact across the company. So we're pretty we're pretty jazzed here. Puneet Souda : 32:17 That's super helpful, Chuck. Jim, on the op margin obviously really strong in the quarter, almost 40%. Just wanted to understand in terms of near-term China hiring and other initiatives sort of ongoing sort of how should we think about the sustainability of this op margin and just maybe take us through the puts and takes there, in the near term and sort of if you could provide anything on FY \u201823 and how should we think about up margins sort of longer term. Appreciate it. Thank you. Jim Hippel : 32:51 Yeah. So on the real -- near term, I mean we're not only we're coming off of our guidance and target that we started the year with which is that we would end the year at the same, roughly the same adjusted operating margin that we ended fiscal year ;21. We're still on track to do that. Now, I understand that, that would mean from Q3, a sequential decline in operating margin, but however, we are making improvements of -- vast improvements in our hiring, which we talked about. And the ExoTRU that piece of it was a bit of a margin lift that won't reoccur next quarter. So we're basically right on track to do as we said we would do in terms of how we expect to finish this year from a margin perspective. 33:32 FX will be a bit more of a headwind in Q4 that even it was in Q3, but I think we'll overcome that to still hit our year-over-year, roughly flat operating margin for Q4. Looking ahead obviously, we'll give more clarity next quarter as we finish up our operating plans for next year, but it's the same message, we've been saying all along, which is that we expect it to be --there to be incremental slight but incremental margin improvement over the course of the next four or five years of strategic plan and we expect that to start next year \u2013 that continue next year. Operator : 34:09 Our next question is from Jacob Johnson with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Jacob Johnson : 34:15 Hey. Good morning. Congrats on nice quarter. Maybe just Chuck, I think you touched on a little bit, but just flush out the point. Just on the Academic end market, it sounds like it picked up a little bit this quarter. And -- but NIH funding finalize, kind of hopefully improves from here. And maybe I mean answering the question for you, but what's your outlook for that end-market as we think about the next couple of quarters? Chuck Kummeth : 34:40 Yeah. Well the clarity on NIH funding didn't happen quite in time to really boost U.S. a whole lot. We were ending up in low-single digits. Europe was in teens, actually, so the net-net was mid overall. So that's why I say, looking forward, we're going to see the bigger lift in the U.S. going forward this quarter. And if Europe stays in the mid-teens, we'd be thrilled. So, and I think it's a good story going forward. It's finally starting to break loose. And again, the momentum is there overall, we've got great platforms that have a lot of interest from Academia, so that's just, that's always a fundamentally, you've got to have, you've got a new to the world stuff that they get some excited to do and go after new academic frontiers, which we continue to do in this company, so we have now doubt we'll be fine. Jacob Johnson : 35:30 Okay. And then maybe as a follow-up. Appreciate the details on the Wilson Wolf performance in the quarter. If my math is right, it sounds like if they keep going the way they're going the kind of Phase 1 20% ownership, maybe that could happen in the next year. Can you just talk about the timing of owning a piece of that and then owning the entire company? Chuck Kummeth : 35:54 Yeah. The original plan with the be kind of really Q3 next year, but we're ahead of schedule. There is a possible it could be at this calendar year. I mean they are on a $72 million run right now and they're literally getting record breaking sales days like every week. So it's hard to say, I too, I'm trying to pin down John Wilson when it will be and it's hard to pin down, but there is nothing the good news here and they're moving towards -- putting together strong financial execution. So we're seeing all their numbers. We're helping on operationally so read of the integration kind of already occurred to be honest and the team has worked well together for a couple of years and some now with scale ready anyway, so it's -- so we have a good view port in how it's coming and I don't think it will be a year, I think it will be under a year from now. Operator : 36:43 Our next question comes from Alex Nowak quick with Craig-Hallum. Please proceed with your question. Alex Nowak : 36:51 Great. Good morning, everyone. And we talked a little bit about this on the diagnostics business. But I think Diagnostics had a pretty big step up in growth and profitability at least consistent with my expectations. So could you just be a bit more granular on what drove that benefit, ACD sounds good, but consistent Exosome Diagnostics is doing very well. So it's at the base of smaller there. So, and there might have been a one-time item from Thermo Fisher, if I heard you correctly. So just a good -- what's a good revenue run rate here and a good operating margin to assume going forward? Thanks. Chuck Kummeth : 37:21 Yeah. We aren't breaking out the revenue of that division if highly competitive we've got a two or three competitors I'm sure even listening right now. So we don't get into that, but we have talked about the test rates, that are 50% up is real. It's still largely we\u2019re being paid via Medicare. We're still working the private payer, but we're getting, we're getting better. It's -- we are very close to going from cash to accrual, that's also going to help probably next quarter is our goal maybe, but we\u2019ll see, but you know, we're getting there and we have a whole new team for surgeon taking the helm there especially commercially, it's really worked wonders. We are seeing record test days again this area too or pre-pandemic every week. Alex Nowak : 38:11 Got it. Understood. And then, Chuck, you just, it sounds like in the freight remarks you mentioned inflation, but also the ability to push through pricing. So did I hear you correctly that you are in fact, pushing some price increases through on the core kits and reagents business and this is -- how much headroom do you have there before that worry about competition? Chuck Kummeth : 38:30 Well, net-net, I always been big on price, it's just in my DNA and we've put in place processes and structure here years ago and went after kind of an annual 1% net year kind of target and we're well above that this year. And we had to be focused on obviously costs are going up, but we've got wage inflation to cover. And as Jim pointed out in his numbers, we more than covered, but we need to cover with price to give us a strong margins. I don't think there is an upside beyond the steady state we're at right now but if inflation continues to happen, well then, we'll continue to raise prices like everybody else. We've offset a lot to of efficiencies and productivity as well. It's just can be -- we can pass everything on. But there has been a good mix and we've been doing really well with it. Well north of the 1% probably 2-ish or better. Alex Nowak : 39:25 I appreciate the update. Thanks. Operator : 39:29 Our next question comes from Catherine Schulte with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Catherine Schulte : 39:37 Hey, guys. Congrats on the quarter and thanks for the questions. I guess first on China, anyway to help us think about the magnitude of the impact of lockdowns for your fiscal fourth quarter. What are you seeing now from customers and how do you expect that unfold over the next couple of months? Chuck Kummeth : 39:55 Yeah. We've had a few meetings with our team obviously and they are actually very bullish about this quarter yet. They were the same way when we look at the pandemic and China was first kind of, staying to the jaws of that and we are all very concerned and then they came roaring back next quarter beyond any of our belief and we were, we were -- we outpaced all of our peers, I believe back then. We expect the same, there will be -- they may be shut down right now on a lot of sites but demand will be pent up. It doesn't affect anything but run rate reagents. I mean the instruments and stuff and there is no issue with the orders of there, the bookings are there. We're stacking up bookings right now and we've got a lot of orders to fulfill once they unlock. 40:39 I know there is petitions to the government to be in the first wave of companies that come out of lockdown. I know we're on that list, along with many of our peers in our industry because we're all considered highly valuable to the economy there into the -- the government. There literally can do research there. If they don't have R&D systems based protein. So we'll be ready to go and I can't imagine is being more than a one quarter blip. And I can't imagine being more than it's hard to say what the material impact of be maybe nothing, maybe a couple of points. We don't know enough yet. 41:11 Now if the lockdown continues and go with another quarter or two, but then I think we'll off to have more discussion, but right now we're not seeing any of that. No one is predicting any of that. The government there seems to be working very hard to trying to unlock even sections of the city, institution-by-institution even if it comes to that. So they really are engaged with the private and public sectors together there. It appears to us, but from our teams point of view. So I think everyone's going to an impact, but in terms of looking at who has a least might impact of that will be to top of that list like usual. Catherine Schulte : 41:47 Okay. Got it . And then on the Thermo ExoTRU partnership, what are they doing from a development standpoint for that test and you have a sense for when we could see Medicare coverage? Chuck Kummeth : 42:01 Yeah. We will all take it through their MAC. They'll finish and do the another study. We have one-off that we've got a great paper good data, but they don't want to beef it up with another outcome dataset and they'll use that to try and get their approval through with their MAC. We have kind of rough that that obviously there we got -- you've got a present out there and they're jurisdictional ready. So it's going to be a lot easier process to get qualified than it would be for us going through NGS. So we think it shows a year off commercialization if we were going to do it ourselves. 42:31 Along with that they've got, they've got a juggernaut of a business unit with that division and Thermo Fisher with a channel and sales force and technical team and regulatory army everybody -- they're all raring to go and there, like I said, they're pushing us. So this is fantastic. I think it's roughly a year from now, maybe for guessing I don't know. They'll go as fast as they can and whatever they do it will beat us by a long -- long way as I'm sure. And it allows us to, work on the next one. So we're already working on a couple more and whether we partner with them or somebody else or do it ourselves remains we've seen. I know that Thermal has two other organ rejection tests, they like us to work on for them. So the pipeline is growing. We have more projects than we have people to work on. Operator : 43:22 Our next question comes from Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Patrick Donnelly : 43:30 Hey. Thanks for taking the questions. Chuck, maybe just on Europe, you put up another kind of nice high-single-digit there. Any change in demand from what's happening there on the geopolitical side, any shift in funding or anything that you're seeing on the Academic side. Just wondering kind of what the outlook is on the Europe please? Chuck Kummeth : 43:50 No, it's been Europe is Europe, if you get one bad year for [indiscernible] no matter what goes on and in this country by country and it sets Europe as well. I think on the shift coming out of Brexit, we're working and opening another warehouse site in export site out of Ireland, which is going to help us with the Mainland. We have pushed employees out the UK because of Brexit back into their home countries. So we have now operating offices in Germany, Italy, and France and we're beefing up all those sites. Our project is strongest as to out of Italy, because they know we did an acquisition with our largest distributor in Europe at the time a few years ago. 44:30 The leadership is solid. We're bringing in more. We have probably tripled in size, since I've been here and get into a bit of a tipping point there in general. Funding is pretty stable. Execution, I think is issue for us, especially in things like spatial biology and no issue I don't think on our core reagents in assays. I think it's just steady she goes it's another reason we've been so strong overall as a company. Europe has been very stable there. I'd say instrumentation, we probably are little behind there compared to U.S. And there's probably some upside there. As you know that selling proposition is highly technical and there is one place we're beefing up because you have to have FAS out in the field along with your sales reps and work at that way, longer sales cycle to of course and -- but that's kind of where we're focused on and where we're trying to improve the situation. It's been double digit. This year has been more mid to high-single digit. I think the next year, hopefully get back to be good solid double digit will see it will, it will come down execution more than is the markets. I think the markets are there. Patrick Donnelly : 45:37 Okay. That's helpful. And maybe on the capital allocation side obviously Wilson Wolf will keep an eye on, but can you just talk about general capacity outside of that appetite what the pipeline looks like for you guys priorities on that front? Chuck Kummeth : 45:52 Well, you know hang tight. We're always working deals and they range from small to mid-size . We don't really have any monsters things going high. The whole world kind of waiting on a new evaluation level before things are going to price. Things that are helping the IPO front is kind of dead. So there is probably more interest at the private level and smaller company founder is trying to exit. So we're hopeful, we're still looking at the same kinds of things, things and cell and gene therapy and our cell sorting other areas like that there's, there are four or five categories were very interested in. We have, as Jim pointed out, we're about net debt zero. So we've got capacity and then some. We have an LLC that still pretty rich for us to go into -- should we want to and it comes down to finding the targets and getting them at the right prices. So we have a decent ROIC with them. So, but it has not -- it's as good as -- it's not, it's not gotten any worse. I mean our pipelines as full as ever and we're pretty active right now so we'll see. Operator : 46:58 Our next question is with Paul Knight from KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question. Paul Knight : 47:06 Chuck, how did you get pricing put through in Q1 orders, we see more pricing hit in the subsequent quarters? Chuck Kummeth : 47:16 Well, like everybody, you've got pricing on a catalog or you can do it want you want and you got a lot of OEM business and supply agreement, you've got hit certain calendar dates and there is usually in an annual event. We hit a lot of those in January 1 and took advantage as best we could, both probably be able do some more come July 1. In the meantime, on the run rate side of our business, we were always pricing and repricing as we go. As you know, we've got a lot of, a lot of products, we're the only ones in the world. And so we can do we want. And so we have a little more flexibility there than some of the areas where we're more of a commodity, where we have to, we have to compete. And we have to fight because we have to be a full catalog. So it's always a complicated balanced portfolio, kind of thing and like I said in the past we've kind of shot for a 1% net kind of year-on-year and this year it's probably double that we're shooting for and so far so good we're doing -- the team is doing pretty well. 48:11 I got to pay for all these mid-year wage increases and a higher annual merit rate features that's coming our way. Areas like IT and others are, we're not talking about 10%, 20% pricing wage increases can be as much as 50%. So it's an interesting time for the war on talent. And so, but I'm proud of the team and the finance team in particular and the marketing teams, they've really done well with this and you can see by our IR results. We're covering it and then some. Paul Knight : 48:43 And then, Chuck, a common discussion right now in the market is of course around early stage biotechnology funding, do you see that or do you see that rolling out as a risk in the future here? Chuck Kummeth : 48:57 We get asked that a lot and quite frankly, we're baffled. So we are not seeing -- if anything, it's a strong area for us. So no issue, where it's coming from. Operator : 49:13 Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I would now like to turn the call back over to Chuck for closing remarks. Chuck Kummeth : 49:20 Well, thanks everybody for participating. It was a great quarter. Two quarters in a row for us at 17%. We have got a good quarter yet to come here and finishing off an outstanding year and we think we're on track with our strategic plan and look forward to telling you more about that next quarter. Thank you. Operator *: 49:42 This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Bio-Techne Earnings Conference Call for the Fourth Quarter of Fiscal Year 2022. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the call will be opened for questions following management's prepared remarks. During our Q&A session, please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. I would now like to turn the call over to David Clair, Bio-Techne's Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Development. Please go ahead. David Clair : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me this morning are Chuck Kummeth, Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Hippel, Chief Financial Officer of Bio-Techne. Before we begin, let me briefly cover our Safe Harbor statement. Some of the comments made during this conference call may be considered forward-looking statements, including beliefs and expectations about the company's future results, as well as the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and financial results. The company's 10-K for fiscal year 2021 identifies certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements made during this call. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements because of any new information or future events or developments. The 10-K as well as the company's other SEC filings are available on the company's website within its Investor Relations section. During the call, non-GAAP financial measures may be used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. Tables reconciling these measures to most comparable GAAP measures are available in the company's press release issued earlier this morning on the Bio-Techne Corporation website at www.bio-techne.com. Separately, we will be presenting at the Wells Fargo, Baird and Morgan Stanley Healthcare Conferences in September. We look forward to connecting with many of you at these upcoming conferences. I will now turn the call over to Chuck. Chuck Kummeth : Thanks, Dave and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter conference call. We had a tremendous finish to our fiscal 2022 as our 14% organic growth for the fourth quarter cap of the year where we delivered 17% organic growth for the full fiscal year. In our fiscal 2022, we surpassed an important milestone as we exceeded $1 billion actually 1.1 billion in revenue for the first time in our corporate history. These strong results were delivered in the face of the most challenging comp the company has faced since I joined in 2013 and the impact of a longer than expected COVID-related shutdown in China. I'm extremely proud of the global team strong execution this dynamic environment. Some of the highlights in the quarter include continued strength in our biologics instrument portfolio, we delivered over 30% growth for the seventh consecutive quarter. Ongoing traction with our cell and gene therapy workflow initiatives return to double-digit growth in our spatial biology business, as well as another consecutive record setting quarter for ExoDx prostate tests. We remain incredibly well-positioned and under penetrated some of the fastest growing life science tools and diagnostics markets. In our portfolio, proteomic, genomic and diagnostic products continue to deliver the solutions necessary to drive scientific discoveries and ultimately improve healthcare. Given the inflationary environment we are all dealing with let's briefly discuss how we are successfully navigating these challenges. As a reminder, approximately 80% of our revenue mix is consumables and encouragingly given their biological nature these tend to have more modest raw material costs. Approximately 10% of our sales are instrumentation where we do have higher input costs but still maintain gross margins in line with corporate averages. We have been strategically implementing price increases throughout our portfolio to offset our exposure to rising costs, including labor, and will continue to pull this lever going forward. Speaking of labor, we made significant progress in our human capital initiatives in the quarter. encouragingly, we are seeing signs of an improving labor market is some of the headwinds we faced in recent quarters to attract and retain talent appear to be subsiding. In fiscal 2022, we added over 400 individuals to the team and have grown to over 3000 Bio-Techne team members. These net headcount additions were across the organization as we strengthen the commercial, technical and corporate team at all levels. We will continue to hire as we execute our strategic growth initiatives going forward. And I'm very encouraged with the recent progress on this front. Now let's discuss the specifics of our performance this quarter, starting with our geographies and end markets. From a global perspective, we experienced robust growth across geographies with the exception of China, our North American revenue grew in the upper teens for both the quarter and our fiscal year. In Europe, we finished on a very strong note because we grew in the mid-teens for both the quarter and the fiscal year. For China, first I'd like to recognize the relentless efforts of the team. Our China base being successfully petitioned to be one of the initial companies permitted to return to work, as our products were deemed to be critical to the country. Once we were allowed back in our Shanghai based warehouse that serves as a distribution hub to all of our China base customers, our dedicated team literally lived to the facility. To ensure we were able to begin supplying the research community with proteomic reagents, analytical tools and spatial biology products. These COVID-related lockdowns lasted longer than expected in several large cities. Overall, organic revenue in China declined low-single digits for the quarter. These important Chinese market started the reopening process in June and we saw a nice bounce back in revenue especially in our research reagents business. The strong June performance is encouraging and we look forward to returning to our historical growth trajectory in this geography. Once again, our biopharma end market remain very strong growing over 20% globally for both the quarter and the fiscal 2022. Sales in our academic end market increased in the upper single digits for the quarter, and the mid-single digits for the fiscal year. We are seeing signs of continued improvement in our U.S. academic end market. As research budget clarity, and increased NIH outlays are benefiting spending on our research reagents, proteomic analytical tools, and spatial biology solutions. Now let's discuss our growth platform starting with our protein sciences segment where we grew organically by 16% for the quarter, and 19% for the fiscal year. During the quarter, we advanced our cell and gene therapy initiatives. As our reagents media technology and workflow solutions continue to deliver the necessary solutions to progress therapy development and clinical trials. Before we get into the numbers, I'd like to highlight an emerging cell therapy application called regenerative medicine that is garnering significant investment in clinical trial activity, which in turn is driving growth in our technologies and products enabling these workflows. This background, regenerative medicine or regen med, leverages stem cells or their derivatives to promote the repair response of disease dysfunctional or injured tissues. Stem cells are unique as they can be induced to differentiate into any cell type. For example, muscle, heart, pancreatic, nerve and blood cells. This functionality has found robust BioPharma activity to use stem cells as a treatment and potential cure for many diseases and chronic conditions including diabetes, tissue repair, spinal cord injury, chronic wound healing and others. This increased activity is sparking demand across our portfolio of cell therapy products and technologies including reagents, assays, media, instruments and spatial value products. Our portfolio GMP proteins includes 19 cytokines, including 11 that are only available from biotechniques that are key to scaling these regen meds activities. Disinterest in regen med is also acting as a significant tailwind for our matrix products, as these provides structural support for cells and play an important role in establishing tissue organization by influencing cell adhesion, proliferation, migration and differentiation. Our portfolio of matrix products increased over 110% in the quarter and are quickly becoming significant contributors to our burgeoning cell and gene therapy business. Specifically for our GMP protein business during the quarter, we transitioned two additional GMP proteins to our state-of-the-art GMP protein dedicated manufacturing facility. Following these latest launches, we are now manufacturing five GMP proteins in this new facility at the scale and capacity necessary to meet current forecasted demand. Overall, our portfolio of cell and gene therapy products, technologies and solutions increased over 50% for fiscal 2022. Now let's discuss the performance of our research reagent portfolio including our broad catalog of RUO proteins and antibodies. Once again, our brand reputation targeted new product introductions, marketing strategy and execution road above market growth as our research reagents increased low teens for the quarter and mid teens for fiscal 2022. During the fiscal year, we added approximately 1000 new R&D systems branded proteins, antibodies and small molecules, including research reagent strengthening our core portfolio and immunology, immune oncology and targeted protein degradation. Shifting to our proteomic analytical tools where the team delivered mid-teens growth for the quarter and high teens growth for the fiscal year. Once again, our biologics platform Maurice lead the way increasing were 35% in the quarter. This marks the seventh consecutive quarter of above 30% growth this platform as we continue to see strong demand for protein therapeutics, gene therapy and CRO, CDMO customers. We recently dramatically improved Maurice's speed with the launch of the turbo, the SDS cartridge. This new cartridge delivers a full 100% throughput increase compared to legacy cartridges, enabling higher speed and high-resolution analysis of protein size and purity across all stages of bioprocess development as well as regulated areas including quality control. Separately, a multi-company study published in the Journal of electro freezes showed excellent comparability of Maurice to its predecessor instrument ICE3. As background, we launched Maurice in 2016 as the next generation system in our ICE instrument portfolio. Multiple biopharma companies have requested comparability data between ICE3 and Maurice prior to upgrading, and we anticipate this study will help these customers eventually transition to Maurice which offers ease-of-use and increased functionality compared to the legacy system. Our Simple Western portfolio of automated western blot solutions continues to gain share, as the ease-of-use reproducibility and speed compared to manual methods resonates with both biopharma and academic end users. This growing awareness and utilization of Simple Western is evident when looking at the number of publications citing simple Western data. As of the end of the quarter, there were over 1600 cumulative publications fighting our Simple Western technology, representing an increase of 12% during the first half of calendar 2022. We view publications as a leading indicator for the growing acceptance of this technology and believe we are positioned for continued growth going forward. Our Simple Western business increased in the mid-teens for the quarter, and in the high-teens for the fiscal year. We continued to experience strong demand for a simple flex automated aminoassay platform Ella from cell and gene therapy customers as our recent assay additions for AV characterization, [indiscernible] 293 host cell proteins and perforin drive adoption in both process development and QC release. In fact, we increased the number of CGT customers selling gene therapy that is leveraging Ella in their workflow by over 65% during the fiscal year and anticipate growing interest from additional accounts as we continue to expand our relevant menu offering. During the quarter, we announced the latest addition to our family of instruments and consumables with the acquisition of Namocell, a leading cell sorting and dispensing company with two instruments currently in the market. Namocell's proprietary instruments and consumables addressed several high growth markets including cell and gene therapy, cell engineering, cell line development, single cell genomics, antibody discovery, synthetic biology and rare cell isolation. While Namocell's business is relatively small today, it is growing quickly, and we are excited to have this technology and talented team under the biotech umbrella. We closed this acquisition on July 1, and initial integration work is progressing nicely. Lastly, our amino acid kit business finished the year on a very strong note as this business grew low double digits for both the quarter and the fiscal year. In addition to healthy demand for ELISA kits, we are increasingly being recognized as the partner of choice for developing Luminex assays for our partners to run this lab designate test or LDT. For example, we recently announced an agreement as the exclusive manufacturer of Nanogens Biosciences oncuria bladder cancer diagnostic panel. This Luminix based multiplex panel combines biotechniques high quality reagents and over 40 years of industry leading immunoassay experience with nanogens, diagnostic experience to create a powerful solution to advanced bladder cancer treatment strategies. Next, let's discuss our diagnostics and genomic segments where we grew revenue organically by 8% in the quarter and 10% for the full fiscal year. Our spatial biology business branded ACD remains the largest global spatial biology business as our highly sensitive biomarker identification technology with single cell detection resolution and quantification capabilities continues to enable the transition from discovery to translational research. Spatial biology returned to double-digit growth in the quarter as an improving academic market and the impact of our fortified leadership in North American commercial teams fostered a challenging year-over-year comp and the impact of the China shutdown. During the quarter, we achieved a significant milestone for our facial biology businesses our market leading portfolio across 40,000 unique RNA scope in situ hybridization probes in over 400 species. We also announced the launch of our CE-IVD RNAscope ISH probe high risk HPV assay for use in patients with head neck cancer to aid in the identification of high-risk Human Papilloma Virus HPV, for use on the automated Leica biosystems BOND III stainer with our sales territories occupied leadership team in place to drive this business forward and expectations for the U.S. academic market to continue to improve. We are expecting steady improvement in our spatial biology growth rates in the coming quarters. Moving on to our molecular diagnostics division. Let's start with a significant progress our X Zone diagnostics business delivered in the quarter. The ExoDx prostate or EPI tests continued to benefit from increasing traffic, the physician office for initial or follow up visits, which in turn, drove improving diagnostic testing volumes including PSA tests, which is a prerequisite for EPI test. This improving physician office environment combined with our digital and traditional marketing initiatives drove almost 70% year-over-year ExoDX prostate test volume growth, as testing levels broke a quarterly volume record for the second quarter in a row. The Exosome diagnostics team had a strong presence at the American Urological Association or AUA conference in May, including the presentation of two posters, as well as six in Lewis Scientific presentations. This was also a great forum to highlight our ongoing partnership with former Baltimore Orioles player \u201cIron Man, Cal Ripken, Jr, who remains an ambassador and advocate for the ExoDx prostate test, which was a part of Cal [indiscernible] prostate cancer journey. Separately, our Medicare Administrative Contractor, National Government Services held a public meeting following our request for reconsideration of our local coverage decision also known as a LCD. As a reminder, we have made significant progress getting the existing LCD to align with a National Comprehensive Cancer Network or NCCN guidelines. Although a few key differences remain, most importantly if the current LCD does not reimburse for repeat usage of our ExoDX prostate test or for patients who previously had a negative prostate biopsy. If successful, the reconsidered LCD would remove these limitations enabling the use of our ExoDX prostate test as a surveillance tool. We encouraged following the opening meeting, and are looking forward to the issuance of the final LCD. Continuing electrodiagnostic, Asuragen had a great quarter as demand for its portfolio of genetic carrier screening kits, or electro diagnostic controls as well as initial traction in Europe drove growth of over 25% in the quarter. In addition to the ongoing geographic expansion, Asuragen has a rich product pipeline positioned the business for continued growth going forward. Finally, our diagnostics reagents business continues to trend a steady growth in the quarter. The return of patients the doctor's office is sparking demand for hematology and clinical chemistry tests, which is driving demand for our clinical controls and reagents, improving patient office visit trends a full pipeline and opportunities for additional share gains within our OEM partners set the stage for sustainable growth in our diagnostic reagents business going forward. Most of you probably saw the press release issued this morning announcing the plan leadership transmission coming in two years. Following the conclusion of our fiscal 2024, I plan to retire is the CEO of Bio-Techne, and intend to continue to serve as a member of the Board of Directors. During my tenure, the Board and I have built an incredibly strong bench of talented results driven leaders that could serve as potential internal replacements. Over the same timeframe Bio-Techne has grown into a leading life science tools and diagnostics company. And I have no doubt that our accelerating organic growth profile in sector leading profitability will attract extremely high caliber external candidates as well. The board's search for a potential replacement has already begun and we will update you when there is news to share. One thing is certain, with a team now over 3000 strong in a product portfolio, directly aimed at some of the hottest areas of scientific research and diagnostics Bio-Techne is positioned to continue to execute our strategic plan during the next two years under my leadership and beyond. With that, I'll pass the call over to Jim. Jim Hippel : Thank you, Chuck. I will provide an overview of our Q4 and fiscal 2022 financial performance for total company provide some additional details on the performance of each of our segments and then give some thoughts on the fiscal year ahead. Starting with the overall fourth quarter financial performance adjusted EPS was $2.05 versus $1.88 one year ago, the increase of 9% over last year. Foreign exchange negatively impacted adjusted EPS by $0.10 or minus 5% in the quarter. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $1.51 compared to $0.37 in the prior year. The biggest driver for the increase in GAAP EPS was unrealized losses on our investments in ChemoCentryx in the prior year. Q4 revenue was 288.2 million an increase of 11% year-over-year on a reported basis and 14% on an organic basis. Foreign exchange translation had an unfavorable impact of 3% to revenue growth. For the full fiscal year 2022 revenue was 1.1 billion, an increase of 19% on a reported basis and 17% on an organic basis. Foreign exchange translation had an unfavorable impact of 1% and acquisitions had a stable impact of 3%. Moving on to the details of the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin was 73.2% in the quarter compared to 72.7% in the prior year. The increase was driven primarily by favorable business mix and productivity gains partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange. Adjusted SG&A in Q4 was 27.8% of revenue, compared to 25.9% in the prior year, while R&D expense in Q4 was 8.1% of revenue compared to 8% in the prior year. The increase in SG&A was due to progress we made in a quarter building the team to position the company for growth going forward, including adding commercial and technical talent. The resulting adjusted operating margin for Q4 was 37.4%, a decrease of 140 basis points from the prior year period. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, adjusted operating margin was approximately in line with the prior year. For the full year fiscal year 22, adjusted operating margin was 38.3%, a decrease of 80 basis points year-over-year. Looking at our numbers below operating income, net interest expense in Q4 was 2.2 million, decreasing 0.8 million compared to the prior year period. The decrease was due to a continued reduction of our bank debt. Our bank debt in the balance sheet as of the end of Q4 stood at 255.9 million. After the quarter we did draw down approximately 100 million in our existing line of credit for the recently completed an MSL acquisition which, together with higher floating interest rate is expected to add approximately 1.4 million to our quarterly interest expense in the first quarter of fiscal year '23. Other adjusted non-operating income was 1.3 million for the quarter compared to 0.7 million in expense in the prior year, primarily reflecting the foreign exchange impact related to our cash pooling arrangement. For GAAP reporting, other non-operating income includes unrealized losses from our investment in ChemoCentryx. Moving further down the P&L, our adjusted effective tax rate in Q4 and for the full fiscal year was 21.2%. Turning to cash flow and return of capital, 102.7 million of cash was generated from operations in the quarter, and our net investment in capital expenditures was 13.6 million. Also during Q4, we returned capital to shareholders by way of 58.8 million in stock buybacks and 12.5 million in dividends. We finished the quarter with 40.7 million average diluted shares outstanding. Our balance sheet finished Q4 in a very strong position with 247 million in cash and short-term available for sale investments, keeping our net debt position negligible at the end of the fiscal year. Next I'll discuss the performance of our reporting segment starting with the protein sciences segment. Q4 reported sales were 217 million, with reported revenue increasing 13%. Organic growth for the segment was 16%, with foreign exchange having an unfavorable impact of 3%. Within the segment the growth was very broad based and nearly all reagent assay and instrument platforms. Our portfolio of cell and gene therapy workflow solutions increased over 50%. Our protein simple branded instruments and consumables increased in the upper teens. And our RUO proteomics research reagents grew in the low-teen. Operating margin for the protein sciences segment excluding the impact of partially owned consolidated subsidiaries is 45.5%, a decrease of 170 basis points year-over-year with favorable volume leverage and productivity gains more than offset by the impact of foreign exchange and strategic investments to support future growth. Turning to the diagnostics and genomics segment, Q4 reported sales were 71.7 million as reported revenue increasing 7%. Organic growth for the segment was 8% with foreign exchange having an unfavorable 1% impact. Within this segment, the diagnostics reagents business increased low single digits and the ACD branded spatial biology portfolio returned to double-digit growth in the quarter. With the fortified leadership in commercial team we anticipate improved growth rates in our spatial biology business going forward. For Exosome diagnostics revenue increased 40% as prostate cancer test counts increased almost 70% compared to the prior year period, representing the second consecutive quarterly test volume record. We are encouraged with the volume trend and anticipate continued improvement as our marketing strategy and value proposition resonates with physicians, patients and payers. Moving on to the diagnostics and genomics segment operating margin at 15.7%, the segment\u2019s operating margin decreased 100 basis points compared to the prior year. The decrease reflects the favorable impact of volume leverage and product mix more than offset by the impact of foreign exchange and to a lesser extent investments to drive future growth. In summary, the growth momentum across our businesses remained strong, using fiscal year '19 as a pre COVID baseline, the company's core organic revenue CAGR has been consistently in the low teens in the past couple of years. As our fourth quarter demonstrated, the biopharma end market is still very strong. We are keeping a close watch on the smaller biotech portion of this end given the current difficult market conditions to raise new capital funding. However, we see the academic market improving compared to fiscal year '22 and with a fully staffed commercial team now in our spatial biology franchise, we expect our gold standard RNA scope products to further penetrate the academic and biopharma end markets with double-digit growth. Add to this, the rapid growth we are seeing with our epi tests and a surge in diagnostic kits and we believe we have many arrows in the quiver that will enable us to at least achieve the same double-digit organic growth rate in fiscal year '23, as our CAGRs from fiscal year '19. Of course, with foreign exchange rates where they currently stand, we expect a 2% foreign exchange headwind to our reported growth for fiscal year '23. However, this should be partially offset by anticipated 1% contribution and the recently closed Namocell acquisition. Both negative foreign exchange rates and the acquisition of Namocell, we will likely have a negative impact on our full year adjusted operating margin for fiscal year '23 by as much as 150 basis points. The impact on year-over-year margin will be more severe in Q1 and gradually become less of a headwind as the year progresses. By the time we reach the end of fiscal year '23, we expect our core margin improvement to offset these headwinds and finished the fourth quarter of fiscal year '23 with approximately 100 basis points of year-over-year margin expansion, thus entering fiscal year '24, right on track to achieve 40% adjusted operating margin by our target of fiscal year '26. That concludes my prepared comments. And with that, I'll turn the call back over the operator to open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Puneet Souda with SVB Securities. Please proceed. Puneet Souda : Yes. Hi. Thanks, Chuck. Jim, thanks for taking the question. So first of all, congrats on a solid print here, despite the China challenges. So maybe Chuck given the transition, I think it's I mean, first of all, it's fair to say that you've done a phenomenal job or in portfolio transformation and the top-line growth, which is in mid-teens and $1.1 billion in operating profile that is reflecting a 40% off margin. So that's, I mean, just great to see across the life science tools industry. So I mean, I wish you want to retiring, but maybe just walk us through, sort of what went into this decision and maybe talk to us about the overall organization today. I mean, you have a target of $2 billion by FY '26. You're pivoting more into cell and gene therapy. So potentially, there's a lot to be excited about. But how are you thinking about the overall organization what needs to happen in order to deliver that target by FY '26? Chuck Kummeth : I think, man, they keep doing what we're doing, so we had a hell of a year 17% growth, we'll be giving our usual, mild range guidance here for the coming year. And it's start with the double-digit for sure. As you know, by the end of our cycle 2026, we're going to be at a 17% for sure, right, we need to be there to hit the 2 billion and we're more confident of ever doing that. The team is, over the last almost 10 years I've been here, we've been building it. And with the retirement of [indiscernible], last year, we picked up guys who has extremely strong domain knowledge in all the hot areas that we're getting into cell and gene therapy in particular. So the bench is set. Of course, Jim is here, Jim's 10 years younger than me. So, got a long runway to go here with some solid candidates internally, as well as the board will do their fiduciary duty, and they'll look externally as well. They've already talked about that. And we're doing a two-year glide path here. So there's nothing overnight till by the time, I'm out of here. And I intend to be on the Board and going forward from then we'll be close to our 2 billion hopefully anyway. So I'm more worried about and thinking about that the person replacing me, when I'm doing my tenure, it'll be a 500% growth 5x from when I started then person replacing me has to have that kind of runway so we can take it from one half billion or more to between 7.5 billion and 10 billion and the pawns we're in as, we're low in share in all the markets we serve, we see no problem making this a fantastic company going forward and an even stronger leader in the life science tools and diagnostic market so. Puneet Souda : That's great. And then just wanted to check on Wilson both that was nearing a run rate of your potential target timeline for acquisition. Maybe you just update us the with the business there. And with that, maybe Jim can also talk sort of what sort of leverage ratio once you have that deal closed? And sort of -- how should we think about the leverage ratio and your cash position and how does that change any M&A prospects for you, or as you look at targets out there, given the current valuations? Chuck Kummeth : Well, we've never been in a stronger position for cash and for our debt level. So we're definitely hunting. But we fully expect to consummate the first tranche of our deal before end of the calendar year here, that takes the 20%. So for $250 million, less the upfront option that we gave them. So they're on track, the growth is steady, 700 to 800 customers, de facto standard, nothing is impeding that. And we have also $100 million or so for Namocell as well. And Jim can talk about our leverage going forward, but we're certainly going to get a little more cash and but we're sitting in a great spot to do it. And then I've mentioned before, this is going to be an excellent year for M&A. It's already taken off pretty strong because you look at our peers across the world here. Jim Hippel : Yes, Puneet, I'll just add, I mean, we've got -- powder is not an issue. We're setting up pretty much net debt zero, as of the end of June 30. We just did an MSL acquisition. And assuming we do, some will hear by the end of the calendar year, and with the operating cash flow we regenerate in the meantime, we'll still probably be at or less a one time to turn. And as we've said before, we're very comfortable going up to North of three for the right deals, so powder will not be the issue. Operator : Our next question comes from Jacob Johnson with Stephens. Please proceed. Jacob Johnson : Hey, thanks. Good morning and Chuck congrats on all you've accomplished over the last couple of years and on the retirement announcement that I think you're still stuck with us for another seven quarters. On the biopharma end market, Jim mentioned you guys are keeping an eye on Sunday. And can you just talk about, are you see any signs of a slowdown from activity in the end market doesn\u2019t sound like it. This biopharma was strong, but just any thoughts there? And then as we think about your portfolio, if we continue to see financing, be sluggish, just kind of talk about how you view that maybe impacting some of your key segments. Chuck Kummeth : Yes, sure. We finished the quarter very strong and as we've mentioned, in the past, we haven't seen too much degradation in any of our markets. We finished in the U.S. biopharma around 30% growth and academia keeps trickling, north and our near high single digit growth for the quarter in the U.S. better than that, in Europe again, teens. But we are looking forward, it's kind of hard to answer because looking now from July. July is kind of soft for us anyway, as for everyone, and it kind of gets -- it's different year-on-year. I do think that this is a year where a lot of people are tired and traveling and taking off for the first time. So I think we're seeing some of that. What we'll see right now, we see strong continuing momentum in biopharma, you are specifically asking about biotech. We'll see. But I think most of the markets are still doing fine that you've seen our peers pay and make the same kinds of statements. But it's hard to really make the statement going into July and August. Anyhow some of our areas, especially like exosome, this is one there, it\u2019s the softest time of the year for them anyway, so things like that, but we'll know more in about a month or so. And we're not too concerned yet. I mean, things are kind of like we usually see about this time of year. Jim Hippel : The only thing I would add there, Jacob is, keeping in mind that our core business is reagents and relatively low dollar instrumentation that adds the productivity. So if there is any kind of slowdown in biotech, usually it's the high capital expenditure items that we'll see at first and as long as they continue do their experiments, they're going to still need our reagents and in our value add low cost instrumentation. So the risk I think is lower for us. Chuck Kummeth : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from Dan Arias with Stifel. Please proceed. Dan Arias : Good morning, guys. Thanks for the questions. Chuck may be on ACD. Good to see a return of double-digit growth there. I have you at right around 10% growth for the year. The long-term CAGR that you outlined at the Analyst Day is mid 20. So for that portfolio, how do you think fiscal 23 growth fits into the trajectory there? And then relatedly, Jim, how much of the hiring that you've highlighted as necessary for that business? Have you been able to complete at this point? Chuck Kummeth : Yes. I can cover both because it's not much change from last quarter in hiring. So we're at full strength, we're literally and we're hiring more. I promised a return and we were there. There's been new leadership for going on six months, leadership is fantastic. And we're back in the teens and will drift away back to North of 20 here. It's only 10 for the year, because of the a year ago, a couple of soft quarters, which we had to make changes. And we lost a lot of people on the sales front, which we recovered from. We've done other things initiatives, like I've mentioned in the past, like giving equity to our salespeople, that's also helped a lot. This is a very technical sale. So these people we have in the field in this area are very, very strong in their domain knowledge. So it's not an overnight replacement situation. But we've been there for a quarter now at full strength and results are showing themselves. So same thing in Europe, I'd say Europe is a little behind the U.S. And there is a service component to this business too. That's a longer sales cycle. And so we're busy trying to get that back on track as well, in which we're seeing strong improvement. So our thesis is 24%, I think we are having the $2 billion model. And we think we're there. Remember, we're still on discoveries, this is translational, from discovery to translational, we've got automation coming out, like we got new products coming. And we haven't done much to crack pathology. And there's a lot of pathology in our future, this platform as well. So we stand behind our guns here saying this is a $300 million kind of business, it should be and to hit 300 million is north of 24%. So we were pretty bullish on this platform. It is the largest spatial business out there right now. It continues to be. So we understand where the target but we're addressing that and we're trying to get out there and be more be louder about the leader that we are. I don\u2019t know if you want to add any more, Jim. Jim Hippel : No. I think, it\u2019s well said. Operator : Our next question comes from Catherine Schulte with Baird. Please proceed. Catherine Schulte : Hi, guys. Thanks for the questions. And I will echo the earlier comments about [indiscernible] but glad we get a little bit longer with you. Was hoping you could give a little more color on what you're seeing in China. I think after the initial COVID lockdowns, you saw some stocking once customers returned to the bench. So is that something you're expecting to happen in your fiscal first quarter? Chuck Kummeth : Coming off the COVID, the super weak quarter, we had this amazing surge is all that occurred, all that restocking and redoing experiments. And it kind of surprised everyone in the industry how fast China came back. And we had a record year and last year, we're still north of 20. For the year, we see looking forward, this is still a 25% growth engine, even though now we're north of $100 million in base. I think there'll be some stocking here. I don't think we're out of the woods here on turning it all back on. There are a lot of academic institutions that are not coming back online until after the elections in October. So there's going to be a continual lift in China. And we're very bullish, we don't see any concerns there, it's just -- was a soft quarter for us. We all knew would be. It can't be shut down for two months out of three and not have an impact. And yet, we are still near flat. The snap back is coming back pretty well. And of course, our warehouse was in Shanghai. So that affected all of China for us. And so as long as we keep our warehouse open here, I think that's good news for the rest of how we serve China for the rest of the country. So we will build our way back. Letting off the hook for another very strong plan for this coming year. And they're very bullish on it. Catherine Schulte : Great. And I was hoping we could talk a little more about the Namocell acquisition, what are the growth rates and margins there and how do you expect those to trend over the next few years? Chuck Kummeth : Yes. This is a fantastic asset. We've been talking to this team for four years kind of a really we are waiting until they had their two laser system in the market. Now they are, it's selling like hotcakes. I mean, you can talk about growth rates, it's a three digit number, it's a really good number. They are definitely already in instrument counts that are significant. And as you know, this is a kind of a best-in-class solution for cell isolation and cell sorting, which affect a lot of markets, not just cell and gene therapy, but a lot of different applications. And it picks away at slow cytometry as well. And they have ideas in the drawing board about if it going really dead center at that market as well. So it\u2019s a fantastic team, smart people, good IP, already off and running in China. As a matter of fact, retention is fantastic, integration is ongoing and started. And again, we've been friendlies for years. So I think we kind of came into this kind of hit the ground running in terms of integration. It's a strong application based on strong science and IP. And it just kind of fits our thesis, so it\u2019s the investments that we pick up. And we've been excited to get this and we have been waiting, and we're thrilled to have that team on board, and you'll see this be a major platform for us in the coming years. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Alex Nowak with Craig-Hallum Capital Group. Please proceed. Alex Nowak : Great. Good morning, everyone. I'm just hoping we could speak to the expectations to the overall growth range in the new fiscal year, as we talked about in the Q&A session. We got a couple of crosscurrents. We got China kind of coming back online, maybe not full strength, but it's recovering, maybe a more questionable funding environment for the life science projects. And then you still got this high growth cell gene therapy business. So just how you thinking about growth throughout this year, the cadence throughout this year? Chuck Kummeth : Yes. So the plan this year is kind of like last year, we'll start out a little softer and very strong, just like we did. Comps, it\u2019s still a tough comps for us in Q1, and then they get a little better for us going forward. But not that much better. This is an aggressive business, and we're a double-digit player now, we expect to continue. We as you know, Alex, we don't give real guidance, least we don't get quarterly. But we do think that our range of this coming year is something probably 11 and 12-ish percent to up to mid-teens in that range. And we'll keep you posted as we do better. But as you mentioned, with China's still being a little a little softer as we go forward to fully turns on, which is really more like Q2, and other situations out there, we'll see. But we have other things that are counteracting these possible slowing, I mean, [exo] [ph] was lighting up, you guys aren't asking about light in the exo. But it was in a tremendous quarter with 70% test growth, 40% organic growth and over 7000 tests. We are just killing it. And it's their time and it's going to be taken off. We're going to an accrual methodology pretty soon here as well, if not this coming quarter. It's time that the reconsideration is going to really allow us to double the TAM for us. We've got 75,000 tests that have occurred out there in the past that are all waiting for a reoccurrence. And so there's a lot of upside there. We just talked about spatial. Spatial is back in the in the groove. And it's already $100 million business in that range. So it's material. And as long as our core stays where it is, and proteomics is still strong, biopharma, it's 30% kind of growth rates, we see an amazing double-digit year ahead of us and we're not going to get more bullish than mid-teens at this point, but we never do. Alex Nowak : Okay. Understood. That's helpful. And then going back to Namocell. I think in hindsight here, Techne was just clearly lacking in cell separation system. I think that's critical for cell and gene therapy, and as you outlined for other areas, too. But now as you survey the cell and gene therapy space, just what other tools What other products out there could be useful to kind of tuck into the bag and combine with the rest of the portfolio? Chuck Kummeth : Well, we're getting pretty darn close to a complete closed workflow. There's not much left that we need. I would say cryopreservation will be one area. There are some more cell analysis type tools and I guess, call them like QC areas and stuff where the process that might make sense. Obviously, we need to capitalize on scale ready and with getting Wilson Wolf under the 10 tier that'll take care of our bioreactor needs, but it may not be the only one. There may be a place for bags out there and there certainly is the going upstream into the bio processing side of all this, which we really haven't done yet. But as we grow we're going to probably naturally trend that direction, starting first with our proteins and all the things we'll be doing in bulk for customers, right. And I think then the instrumentation, we're counting on the Q, out of [indiscernible] with our scale ready JV. And if that doesn't work long-term, we'll have to either acquire that or do something different. But we then obviously have to have an instrument for [indiscernible] freezes to make the system complete. And right now they've been a fantastic partner. And they're, I wouldn't say as strong as Wilson Wolf, it\u2019s stronger than us right now in proteins. They've been out there a while, and they've got a lot of traction with that platform. And we think we're ready to explore this thing as there is a market, creates itself, which is really the limiting factor right now, as well as this market really come into being and it's coming more every year. Operator : Our next question comes from Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Please proceed. Patrick Donnelly : Hey, guys, thanks for taking the questions. Jim, maybe one for you on the guidance. Just on the margin, side, talking about kind of that exit rate of 100 bps expansion in 4Q. Can you just talk about how we should think about the ramp throughout the year. And then just the key levers, both directions between pricing, supply chain inflation, some of the exos stuff, Chuck mentioned the accrual side. So maybe just talk about the moving pieces there and how we should think about margins throughout 23. Chuck Kummeth : Sure. So they mentioned, roughly 150 basis points for the full year kind of declined, driven almost entirely by FX and the Namocell acquisition. And if we're going to exit the year with 100 basis points of expansion that would suggest that we're going to have worse than 150 basis points contraction in the early part of the year, it\u2019s because the FX headwinds are more severe when you look in the first half of the year, and they are in the back half of the year, as well as, as Chuck mentioned in his opening comments, we had a very successful quarter in Q4 with regards to getting staff back up and holding on to our key people. And that will have a carryover impact, particularly in the first half of the year, where we were way behind in our investments last year. So a combination of that carryover impact of getting fully staffed, in addition to the FX will be more severe in the back half of the year. But then as our operational productivity improves throughout the year, that's where we expect to get back to expansion before we exit the year. Hopefully that helps. Patrick Donnelly : Yes. That's helpful. And then, Chuck, maybe just a quick one on kind of the capital allocation strategy, given the announcement this morning and congrats on the two years. In the next two years, any, is there any reason you guys wouldn't do deals because you're leaving, or what's kind of the way to think about kind of this in between period on the capital allocation set? Chuck Kummeth : Not quite the contrary, this is going to be a good year for shopping. We're out there hunting pretty hard. And we're in the middle of summer right now. We always are. And we'll see what happens. But over thinking two years, I mean the kind of cashflow we have I mean, our EBITDA, two years out is going to be well north of 500, probably 600-ish. And we're going to have plenty to work with, as Jim mentioned earlier, the powder is strong. So I think we're looking for bigger deals. And this may be a good year to pick up a lot of tuck-in mom and pops, that are -- we're thinking IPO and they can't now and stuff so we're looking around those angles too. But we're open to any and all ideas, I guess, anything that makes sense for shareholders and makes our company a stronger company. We're five divisions across two segments. I've always said that once we're at a $5 million kind of revenue, right? This will be a 10-division company, all synergistically connected, across these 10 divisions and in the science being all life sciences. So we see no change in our thesis and we've never been more bullish about, our capital allocation and is primarily M&A. Don't look at us as thinking about major buybacks or dividend increases. It's M&A first. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Knight with KeyBanc. Please proceed. Paul Knight : Hi, Chuck. Congratulations on the change, it sounds like it'll be a while, so that's fabulous for you. The ProteinSimple was one of the earlier acquisitions you did looking back on it and looking forward what are your thoughts on ProteinSimple in terms of share they have today and runway ahead on that particular business that you obviously very instrumental in getting kind of back and growing and transforming that part of the market. Chuck Kummeth : Yes, sure. Well, it's going back six, seven years now. But we did that deal pretty quickly it was on the eve of an IPO and we snatched it. And it was a $50 million business back then not making money. And today, it's a $250 million business making over 30% margins. And it's an instrument business, it's got great IP, we have other things we can add to the platform, we think, and we have runway across all three major platforms, as we've talked about, a lot, I mean, everything from the Ella platform, which we're completing within a year of 510(k) process, the 1345, a brand new facilities, manufacturer they can more than triple the output. So that'll be a sleeper that'll be in pretty much point of care diagnostics in five years, as well as the discovery it's in now, which is crazy growth. But Western is still an amazing platform with way more ahead of it than behind it. And biologics just keep surprising us. I mean, seven quarters in a row over 30% growth. And protein purity, capsid testing, HPLC share taking this thing has got lots of runway, as well, more than we ever thought. So, I look at it and I leave in two years, or I move on to the other board positions and stuff and thinking about here, it's going to be 400-ish, kind of million dollar business unit. And there's no reason why this can't be a billion-dollar unit someday. And it'll have other instruments will add to the platform over time to I'm sure that so. If it was fun out right now, obviously, it'd be really valuable. So I think we paid 300 million for it. So it's been an amazing return, and probably the biggest chunk of our overall value creation over the last 9.5 years, I've been here, which is roughly 2 billion to -- I think today, we're in the 15 billion-ish range. We were 20. But we're all seeing a little setback there. But we're very positive, because we see as the market finally, I guess, bottoms with conviction that there is the Fed done, et cetera, et cetera, there'll be a flow to quality first, and you don't find better quality in an asset than ours. Paul Knight : Yes. And my last question, Chuck, would be like on exosome diagnostics, that seems to be getting traction, would you be an acquirer of diagnostic assets in the future? Or what are your thoughts on the DX sector? Chuck Kummeth : Yes. As you recall, we've been very, very bold in our statements about what we want to be and we don't want to be in diagnostics across the board. We don't really -- don't want to be in infectious diseases in these low-end things that hard to make money and lots of competition, no barriers to entry. But we're a company that's focused on oncology, curing cancer from a research sense, as well as neuroscience, and diagnostics that fit in those realms, because they leverage our assay expertise, 40 years\u2019 worth of experience, that's where we want to flow. The Asuragen team, really came on and helped us immensely. This team is amazing, and they've just lit it up, there. It was the right idea to put this business unit in charge of professionals that have over a decade of experience in diagnostics. And I'm not going to say we won't pick up other assets, but if we do, they're probably going to be, closely related in an areas where there are good returns, no need for heavy difficult science, which usually means going after solid tumor or something in oncology, the difficult areas. And we'll see, there's lots of opportunity here. And we'll never say never. Right now we're kind of focused on, it's a new division with the merging of Asuragen with Exosome. And the growth has been wonderful. And it's lighting up, it's accelerating. And so we're going to ride that horse here for a while and we'll see what happens. But we're still focused on making that a major, major platform for the company. And then I've told you guys more than once you see look out five to 10 years. This is one of the few things we can say in our company, it should be a billion dollars or more. Mr. Kummeth, there are no further questions at this time. Please continue with your presentation or closing remarks. Chuck Kummeth : While we're on the hour. Anyway, thanks for the questions and it was a great quarter and end to a great year, the best ever for us and we hope to give you an even better one this coming year. So talk to you soon. Thank you. Operator : That does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line. Have a great day everyone.",

Separately, we will be presenting at the Credit Suisse, Stifel, Stephens, and Evercore ISI healthcare conferences in November. We look forward to connecting with many of you at these upcoming conferences.  I will now turn the call over to Chuck. Chuck Kummeth : Thanks Dave and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter conference call.  I am pleased to report that we started our fiscal \u201923 with a respectable 7% organic revenue growth on top of what was our most challenging year-on-year comp of over 21% organic growth in Q1 of last year. We achieved this growth despite a slower summer for our business in Europe and continued, although improving, COVID-related shutdowns in China. With the tough comps and, we believe, temporary regional challenges that our protein sciences segment faced, this was the quarter for our diagnostics and genomics segments to shine, and shine it did with 17% organic growth. In our first quarter, we accelerated our spatial biology business to upper teens growth. We continue to drive incredible uptake in doctor and patient usage of our ExomeDx prostate test, and we delivered double-digit growth in our genetic Dx and diagnostic reagents businesses. I will dig into the traction and encouraging trends we are seeing across the segment in our broader portfolio later in the call. But first, I\u2019d like to highlight the corporate sustainability report we recently issued, which details the significant progress we continue to make advancing our environmental, social and governance initiatives. The 64-page report provides insights into Bio-Techne\u2019s commitment to growing the organization in a responsible manner while we deliver the products necessary to advance science and ultimately improve healthcare. Our advancements on the ESG front also led to Bio-Techne\u2019s inclusion in the 2022 Forbes list of Best in State Employers, with this latest achievement representing the third recognition from Forbes so far in calendar 2022. I\u2019d also like to briefly touch on how we are navigating the current global inflationary environment. The team has done an extraordinary job strategically implementing price increases across the portfolio to offset the impact of inflation. We will continue to leverage our pricing power to offset rising costs, particularly labor, going forward. It should also be noted that our operations team has delivered consistently with no supply chain issues this quarter or any in the past days. Now let\u2019s discuss the specifics of our quarter, starting with an overview of our performance by geography and end markets. In North America, consistent execution across the portfolio drove low double digit revenue growth for the quarter, driven by a continued strong bio-pharma end market. In Europe, our revenue decreased mid single digits year-over-year. Here, we experienced an exceptionally slower seasonal summer dip in our consumable run rate business. It seemed like everyone was on vacation in July and August, perhaps making up for the prior two COVID years when travel was more restricted. In any case, our run rates in Europe picked up considerably in September as researchers seemingly returned to the labs; however, the strong double-digit growth in September, which by the way is continuing in October, wasn\u2019t enough to overcome the tough Q1 growth comp year last year when they grew a record 20%. While there are potential macro challenges in the current European environment, our portfolio of proteomic research reagents, analytical tools and spatial biology solutions remain core components to the scientific discovery process and position us to effectively navigate any near term regional instability.  Moving on to China, despite the lingering impact of ongoing COVID-related lockdowns and academic institutions not returning to the labs, we delivered mid single digit organic growth. On top of the COVID challenges, I\u2019d also note that China faced a particularly challenging year-over-year comparison where we grew revenue by over 50% in the region last year. We see China rapidly returning to its historical growth rates as prior year comps normalize, customers continue to better navigate the sporadic COVID-related government restrictions, and the Chinese government continues to emphasize investing in healthcare. Our bio-pharma end market remains healthy, growing upper single digits globally for the quarter and especially stronger in North America, with growth in the mid teens. Sales to our academic end markets increased low single digits year-over-year but again were stronger in North America. Now let\u2019s discuss our growth platforms, starting with our protein sciences segment where organic revenue increased 3% for the quarter on a very strong comp from last year, when the segment grew over 26%. Let\u2019s begin with our cell and gene therapy business, where our portfolio of reagents, instruments, media and technologies streamlined workflows, increased efficiencies, and ultimately expanded access to these next generation therapies at lower costs to the healthcare system. We haven\u2019t discussed TcBuster for a while, so I will update you on the significant progress we are experiencing with our non-viral gene editing technology. TcBuster has several advantages over legacy gene editing methods, including its ability to deliver larger gene editing cargo as well as a more predictable gene insertion location, all at a lower cost compared to viral base gene insertion methods. We continue to educate the market on the advantages of TcBuster, and it\u2019s worth noting that we have signed a handful of commercial licenses to support a growing pipeline of cell therapies, primarily for T-cell and NK cell therapies.  In addition to customers testing TcBuster for therapeutic candidates, we also see growing interest in discovery research to take advantage of the technology\u2019s lower cost and increased speed, enabling the acceleration of candidate selection. TcBuster is currently being trialed in dozens of unique therapies, and we believe the future is very bright for this technology. We continue to penetrate the burgeoning cell therapy opportunity with our portfolio of GMP proteins and are seeing continued momentum in the regenerative medicine, or regen med market. As a reminder, regen med is a form of cell therapy that leverages stem cells or their derivatives to promote the repair response of diseased, dysfunctional or injured tissues. Our GMP capabilities expand beyond proteins and include a portfolio of GMP small molecules. These small molecules are key components in the reprogramming, self renewal, storage and differentiation processes that are key to regen med workflows. While our GMP small molecules business is relatively small today, it is growing rapidly, including over 100% for our first quarter, and has the potential to become a significant contributor to our overall cell and gene therapy business.  Now let\u2019s talk about our core portfolio of proteomic research reagents, including the RUO proteins, antibodies and small molecules that are key components to enabling bio-pharma and academic scientific discoveries. Collectively, our RUO reagents grew nearly 30% in Q1 last year, again highlighting how difficult this quarter\u2019s comp was. Despite the high hurdle, our RUO reagents were able to grow mid single digits in Q1 for this year, driven by our digital marketing capabilities.  Moving onto the performance of our proteomic analytical tools, where we also faced a challenging year-over-year comparison as the business grew over 25% in the same quarter last fiscal year. Overall, the team delivered double-digit growth in North America and China, which was partially offset by much lower performance in Europe leading to low single digit growth for the quarter. Once again, our biologics platform, Maurice, led the growth. We continued to see demand from protein therapeutics, gene therapy, and CRO CDMO customers particularly in North America and China, with a combined growth of over 20%.  Innovation remains a key factor in the growth of our biologics business; for example, we recently unveiled data demonstrating icIEF fractionation on the soon to be launched Maurice Flex instrument. Fractionation is a front-end step in mass spectrometry where the sample to be analyzed is separated into mixture components based on differences in their size, charge, or other characteristics. The data showed how Maurice Flex addresses the labor intensive and time consuming challenges of using legacy methods, including ion exchange chromatography for fractionation. Maurice Flex is scheduled for release in early 2023. In addition to the expanding Maurice capabilities and applications, the platform is also gaining recognition for its environmentally friendly attributes. A recent study in the Green Analytical Chemistry Journal highlighted Maurice as an environmentally friendly method for evaluating the identity and stability of adeno-associated virus, or AAV samples for gene therapy development. The study highlights Maurice\u2019s low sample and reagent volume requirements and built-in waster reservoir as environmentally attributes of the system.  We continue to expand the capabilities of our ProteinSimple line of instruments in cell and gene therapy applications. During the quarter, we added three new viral titer assays for the expanding menu of our automated multiplexing ELISA instrument, Ella, for intact AAV captive quantification and gene therapy research and development. Ella\u2019s wide dynamic range and high precision ensures users get the high quality data required to meet regulatory standards for AA titration throughout bio-protection workflows.  Now let\u2019s shift to the diagnostics and genomics segment, where we grew revenue by 17% organically in the quarter. Our spatial biology business, branded ACD, accelerated to upper teens growth in the quarter as strong commercial execution and an enhanced marketing strategy generated well-balanced growth in both our bio-pharma and academic end markets. In addition to a strong performance from the core RNAscope product line, we are seeing increased traction from our BaseScope and miRNAscope offerings in cell and gene therapy applications, which grew almost 50% and over 70% respectively. BaseScope and miRNAscope are rapidly becoming material contributors to our spatial biology franchise. We recently expanded our RNAscope portfolio with the launch of new automated co-detection assays specifically designed for the Roche Discovery Ultra platform, enabling simultaneous detection of RNA and protein on the same tissue section. These new automated multiomic assays utilize both RNAscope and BaseScope signal applications to deliver best-in-class RNA sensitivity and specificity. When combined with protein detection on Roche\u2019s automated platform, researchers will be uniquely enabled to power translational and clinical research studies. We are also unlocking the cross-segment synergies inherent in the broad Bio-Techne product portfolio. As an example, we recently launched the TSA Vivid flourophores for highly sensitive fluorescent detection of RNAs and proteins in cells and tissues. Pairing these key fluorescent dye reagents from our small molecules business with ACD\u2019s RNAscope sets a new standard for illuminating RNA biomarkers with industry-leading sensitivity and clarity.  Rounding out spatial biology, we also recently filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the United Kingdom to halt infringement of our patented RNAscope ISH technology by a Molecular Instrument Incorporated. We have made significant investments over the years to build our catalog of over 40,000 RNAscope ISH probes available in over 400 species and remain committed to protecting these investments and defending our intellectual property rights in our spatial biology business and more broadly throughout the portfolio. Now let\u2019s discuss our molecular diagnostics business, starting with the significant progress in our exosome diagnostics business. Test volume in our ExoDx Prostate, or EPI test increased over 70% while associated revenue grew over 100% in the quarter. Importantly, a favorable doctor retention trend and steady increases in the ordering physician base sets the stage for continued robust ExoDx Prostate growth going forward. I am extremely pleased with the traction we are seeing in ExoDx Prostate and believe our fiscal 2023 will be the breakout year for this test. Exosome diagnostics also announced initial data on a novel non-invasive saliva-based profiling assay leveraging exosomes to diagnose and monitor individuals with Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome. Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome is an autoimmune disease that is often undiagnosed and misdiagnosed with an estimated 4 million Americans currently living with the condition, but 2.5 million undiagnosed. Symptoms of Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome can mimic other autoimmune diseases, allergies, drug side effects, and menopause, making diagnosis particularly challenging, leading to an average diagnosis time of three years and creating the need for a non-invasive accurate molecular test. We are looking forward to providing future updates for this exciting pipeline assay.  A recent proof of concept study for a novel exosome-based platform capable of monitoring space flight associated neuro-ocular syndrome, or SANS, in astronauts was published in npj Microgravity, or Nature publication. In addition to potentially providing a needed tool to assist SANS in astronauts that are going on longer missions, as well as commercial space passengers, the study showcases the potential power of exosomes for the diagnosis of neurological conditions.  Continuing with molecular diagnostics, Asuragen had another great quarter as demand for its portfolio of genetic carrier screening kits and expansion into Europe drove growth of almost 25% for the quarter. In addition to the ongoing geographic expansion, Asuragen has a rich product pipeline positioning the business for continued growth going forward. Finally, our diagnostics reagents business continued its streak of consistent growth quarters. The return of patients to the doctor\u2019s office is driving demand for hematology, coagulation, and clinical chemistry tests which is driving demand for our clinical controls and reagents. These improving underlying diagnostic trends combined with market share gains and increased wallet share at existing customers led to a low double-digit growth in the quarter and sets the stage for sustainable growth in our diagnostic reagents business going forward.  In summary, we continue to execute our growth strategy and remain on track to deliver our long term financial targets. Our portfolio of proteomic research reagents and analytical tools are critical components of scientific research, are key to unlocking the full promise of the proteomic revolution currently underway, and are positioned to enable the oncoming bio-wave of cell and gene therapies. Layer on to this a portfolio of diagnostics and genomic solutions that include our leading platforms in spatial biology and liquid biopsy and I believe we are just getting started unlocking the full potential value of this business. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jim. Jim Hippel : Thanks Chuck. I will provide an overview of our Q1 financial performance for the total company, provide some additional details on the performance of each of our segments, and give some thoughts on the remainder of the fiscal year. Starting with the overall first quarter financial performance, adjusted EPS was $1.78 versus $1.83 one year ago, a decrease of 3% over last year. Foreign exchange negatively impacted EPS by $0.12, or minus-7% in the quarter. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $2.21 compared to $1.69 in the prior year. The biggest driver for the increase in GAAP EPS was realized gains on the sale of our investments in ChemoCentryx and Eminence during the quarter.  Q1 revenue was $269.7 million, an increase of 5% year-over-year on a reported basis and 7% on an organic basis. Foreign exchange translation had an unfavorable impact of 3% and acquisitions had a favorable impact of 1% to revenue growth. Given the tough comp we faced this quarter versus prior year, I will point out that our two-year organic growth CAGR for Q1 was approximately 13%, right in line with the early part of the five-year plan our leadership team presented at our investor day in New York City a little over a year ago. Moving onto the details of the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin was 70.9% in the quarter compared to 71.2% in the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by unfavorable foreign exchange impact partially offset by productivity gains. Adjusted SG&A in Q4 was 27.3% of revenue compared to 25.1% in the prior year, while R&D expense in Q1 was 8.9%. The increase in SG&A and R&D was driven by wage inflation and progress made in the second half of fiscal year \u201922 in building the team to support ongoing strategic growth investments. Speaking of inflation, the businesses implemented strategic price increases during the quarter to offset the dollar impact of inflation on operating income; however, the dollar-for-dollar offset did have a negative impact on operating margin. Adjusted operating margin for Q1 was 34.8%, a decrease of 300 basis points from the prior year period. The pricing inflation dynamic decreased adjusted operating margin by 120 basis points. Negative foreign exchange decreased margin by another 110 basis points, while carryover of second half fiscal year \u201922 investments drove the remainder of the margin dilution for the quarter.  As stated in the fourth quarter fiscal year \u201922 earnings call, we expect Q1 to be the low point for adjusted operating margins for the year. Going forward, we expect adjusted operating margins to expand sequentially, ending the fourth quarter of fiscal year \u201923 approximately 100 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of fiscal year \u201922. For the full year fiscal year \u201923, our expectation for adjusted operating margin to be approximately 150 basis points lower than the full year of fiscal year \u201922 remains unchanged.  Looking at our numbers below operating income, net interest expense in Q1 was $3 million, decreasing $0.1 million compared to the prior year period. Our bank debt on the balance sheet as at the end of Q1 stood at $264.7 million, an increase of $8.8 million compared to where we finished last fiscal year. During the quarter, we drew down approximately $100 million on our line of credit to fund the Namocell acquisition, which was partially offset by applying the proceeds of our ChemoCentryx investment sale to our debt balance. Other adjusted non-operating income was $1.2 million for the quarter, unchanged from the prior year, primarily reflecting the foreign exchange impact related to our cash pooling arrangements. For GAAP reporting, other non-operating income includes realized gains from the sale of our investments in ChemoCentryx and Eminence.  Moving even further down the P&L, our adjusted effective tax rate in Q1 was 21%.  Turning to cash flow and return of capital, $56.1 million of cash was generated from operations in the quarter and our net investment in capital expenditures was $9.6 million. Also during Q1, we returned capital to shareholders by way of $19.6 million in stock buybacks and $12.5 million in dividends. We finished the quarter with 40.5 million average daily shares outstanding.  Our balance sheet finished Q1 in a very strong position with $203.1 million in cash and short term, available-for-sale investments. Our net leverage ratio remains well below one times TTM EBITDA. During the quarter, we replaced our previous debt financing with a new $1 billion line of credit facility with a five-year term. Our corp dev team has been very active investigating external investment opportunities and this new increased debt facility emphasizes the continued importance M&A will have in our capital allocation strategy. Next, I\u2019ll discuss the performance of our reporting segments, starting with the protein sciences segment. Q1 reported sales were $199.9 million with reported revenue increasing 1%. Organic growth for this segment was 3% with foreign exchange having an unfavorable impact of 3% and acquisitions contributing 1%. Given the tough year-over-year comps that Chuck pointed out for this segment, I will highlight that the two-year organic growth CAGR for this segment is greater than 14%, and the longer term historical five-year CAGR is approximately 12%.  Operating margin for the protein sciences segment was 43.0%, a decrease of 270 basis points year-over-year with productivity gains more than offset by the impact of foreign exchange, price versus inflation dynamics, the fiscal year \u201922 carryover of strategic investments to support future growth, and the Namocell acquisition. Turning to the diagnostics and genomics segment, Q1 reported sales were $69.9 million with reported revenue increasing 15%. Organic growth for this segment was 17% with foreign exchange having an unfavorable 2% impact. As you heard from Chuck earlier, the double-digit growth was broad-based throughout this segment with spatial biology accelerating at high teens organic growth and our exosome diagnostic prostate test really now in hyper growth mode, with a Medicare reimbursement and COVID headwinds behind it.  Moving onto the diagnostics and genomic segment operating margin at 12.4%, this segment\u2019s operating margin increased 20 basis points compared to the prior year. The increase reflects the favorable impact of volume leverage partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange and price versus inflation dynamics. Looking ahead, our end markets remain healthy and our momentum in capturing share in these markets is in line with our five-year plan. As we get past the recent regional challenges in Europe and in China, we are keeping a watchful eye on any potential short-term macro challenges that could impact our trajectory to our long term goals. We have confidence in our nimble and experienced team, who has a track record of successfully navigating dynamic environments. With the toughest comp of the year now in our rear view mirror, we anticipate a return to double-digit organic growth for the remainder of the fiscal year.  That concludes my prepared comments, and with that I\u2019ll turn the call back over to the Operator to open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] We have our first question from the line of Puneet Souda with SVB Securities. Please go ahead. Puneet Souda : Yes, hi Jim, Chuck. Thanks for taking the questions.  First one is really-- I mean, I appreciate that you had tough comps in the quarter for protein sciences, but it was still meaningfully below our number and the street number. I think the key question that we\u2019re getting here is how should we think about protein sciences in the second quarter here, how much of this was really sort of pull forward of demand versus actual weakening of demand, as you talked about Europe and China, and--because I can\u2019t recall a time when you had 3% organic growth in this segment, so maybe just walk us through what you see now and how should we think about the next quarter and for the full year. Chuck Kummeth : Sure, thanks Puneet. I\u2019ll give some comments, but I do remember when I joined it was negative, so I remember plenty of quarters below mid single digits, by the way. It\u2019s just been a while. We are totally on our plan for five years and we had been ahead of schedule, and our models are mid single digit in our core anyway, so don\u2019t forget that. I will cut to the chase right now about September was strong, October is remaining strong. We\u2019re basically double-digit across the board, if not high teens, so things look good. You are exactly correct - we were really hot Q4, coming in at 14 versus consensus of 11. Definitely had some pull forwards there. We\u2019ve done some studying and we had probably--you know, we had a lot of price increases July 1, there was definitely some of that. I think also to point out on the instruments side, we\u2019re not too far off, it\u2019s just more of weakness in Europe, cautiousness around purchasing. But we\u2019ve also dug into what\u2019s going on because our bookings and our funnel is very strong. It\u2019s actually the strongest funnel we\u2019ve ever had, but it\u2019s taken longer to get through the booking cycle and signatures are coming more cautious, this last quarter especially. We were a bit robbed, we think.  You know, we have not had any supply chain issues the last couple years and we\u2019ve been pretty steady-eddy and very good growth, and a lot of other instrument makers and a lot of other higher capital or higher signature purchases have been--have had more supply issues, and we think there\u2019s been a little bit of a bubble of pent-up demand in some areas, and I think we just maybe lost out a little bit on priority in some of the purchases this quarter, is what we\u2019re coming to. We don\u2019t see a lot of issues against price and we don\u2019t see any issues, really, from September on. We definitely had a softer quarter in Europe and some of it was vacation for us. We do live in a little different world - we don\u2019t have direct competitors, it\u2019s kind of pieces here and there, and we have a large segment in biotech as well and there is definitely some on the midrange biotech, there\u2019s definitely been softness, especially in Europe on signatures and conservatism overall. Going forward looks pretty strong. You heard the news from Jim there - we\u2019re more concerned about that, we\u2019re more concerned about our long term outlook, which we don\u2019t think has changed a bit, and that\u2019s some highlights there. We\u2019ll let you dig in deeper now. Puneet Souda : Okay, great. So on the small biotech side, I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re seeing anything there, any sort of weakening of demand. I appreciate your comments about the current--I mean, the September and October.  Jim, if I could ask you about the low to mid teens that you had talked about in the prior quarter, about fiscal year \u201923, what could keep that on the lower end versus the higher end? Maybe just walk us through potential upsides and potential things that we need to watch out on, where it could be lower. Jim Hippel : Yes, so I guess the first thing, to address the biotech, we\u2019re seeing performance in our smaller biotechs relative to our larger pharma. We\u2019re not seeing much differentiation. For us, when you look at the smaller purchase, what we call a run rate business which is lower dollar value, which is probably 80% of the purchases coming through, the growth in Q2 and continuing here in October continues to be mid-teens growth, particularly here in the U.S. Back to Chuck\u2019s earlier point, it\u2019s really the larger bulk purchases that had tougher comps and were more, call it soft this quarter and probably faced more competition with some of the supply chain breaks that were occurring in the larger dollar instrument purchases in terms of competing for dollars.  With regards to looking forward, I think Europe is still the biggest question mark. We\u2019re seeing strong performance here early in October, but obviously the macro picture there is a bit cloudy for everyone, and that\u2019s something we\u2019re keeping our eyes on that could--you know, that would be the one flag that could deter us from achieving double digit, if anything. Puneet Souda : Okay, that\u2019s great, and then last one, if I could squeeze in, on Wilson Wolf, I didn\u2019t hear an update. Just if you could provide an update, and when do you think that options agreement could materialize? Chuck Kummeth : I think we\u2019re still looking at near the end of Q3, in that range, so. I would say overall, I know our cell and gene therapy and our gene proteins, we didn\u2019t have a 50%-plus quarter like we\u2019d been doing. Things have leveled out. It is very lumpy still - we don\u2019t have a lot of large, large customers, and there was some timing in some of that, and Wilson Wolf has seen some of that as well, as well as issues around clinical and finding patients, so things have softened a little but still more or less on track for what our schedule was for them. Although the improvement is in their EBITDA, their EBITDA is north of 70%, so they\u2019re doing really well and as there\u2019s volume, they\u2019re getting good scale, so. So a lot of good news there too, but we\u2019re investing into more sales reps - we\u2019re calling it our surge team. They are helping more out, the whole scale ready team, from a proteins point of view because we\u2019re going to be adding more and more proteins to our factory. The factory the remainder of this year, the fiscal year, we\u2019re going to add six more products, which by far will be the largest menu out there in GMP proteins for both regen and cell and gene therapy, so that\u2019s all a really good story. We just wanted to focus on what we thought you guys really wanted to focus on this quarter, so no issues there. Puneet Souda : Got it, thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. We have the next question from the line of Dan Arias with Stifel. Please go ahead. Dan Arias : Hi, good morning guys. Chuck, how do you see ACD growth tracking across the quarters this year, and what should we pencil in for the impact of the partnership that you have with Akoya? Then on the hiring side, do you feel like the commercial team will be fully staffed out and sort of in the position that you wanted to be to start calendar \u201923? Chuck Kummeth : More or less, yes. We\u2019re down two heads, which is about normal. There\u2019s still attrition in our business, along with everybody else\u2019s, but we\u2019re pretty much at 95% full strength and have been for this quarter. We promised a succession of improving quarters since we kind of turned this around three, four quarters ago, and they didn\u2019t come off that at all. They had a tremendous quarter at 17% growth. I would say Akoya is still more in the future. We\u2019re kind of waiting on them at this point, but we\u2019re ready to go. You saw our other announcements. We\u2019re really going after this front end for mass spec. It\u2019s a big TAM out there and we talk about--you know, LC mass spec and GS mass spec, you know, it\u2019s one term out there, but there are different ways to be a front end on mass spec, which is a massive opportunity and we\u2019re taking more and more share all the time, so we\u2019re focused on that as well. But you know, SPD is good, and we\u2019re going after it eventually, more pathology with automation, and they\u2019re not the only game in town at Akoya. We\u2019re working with more than just them, but we are solidified with them on a deal and the partnership is going very well, and we\u2019re kind of waiting on them to get to the point where we can start making revenue together and getting something out of it, so. Dan Arias : Okay, and then maybe on SimplePlex, as we think about this post-COVID phase that hopefully we stay in here, how are you thinking about average pull through for the installed base and how that might look this year? I mean, you guys obviously placed a ton of those systems during COVID, so when it just comes to this overall comp issue that we\u2019re talking about here, I\u2019m curious how you think utilization and recurring revenue streams compare as we come off the peak. Chuck Kummeth : Yes, well overall in consumables for ASD, we were mid-20s for growth in the U.S., just so you know, so a very strong consumables and similar double-digit growth overall with SimplePlex in the U.S. It\u2019s more of an issue around Europe and just some of the normal lumpiness we see with the instruments on the large orders around these big clinical with SimplePlex, but very solid. We\u2019re knocking on the door of getting near 2,000 machines in the field, and those things chew cartridges like crazy, right, so we see a big, bright future and get ready, clinical stuff is right around the corner. We have very little in clinical yet - it\u2019s all coming, a lot of interest. Still one of the biggest [indiscernible]. Dan Arias : Do you see utilization as a headwind this year? Is that one of the areas where you think there\u2019s a headwind when you just think about how much those systems might have been run last year and potentially running less this year? Chuck Kummeth : Maybe in Europe potentially, and there is certainly one large customer in Europe that we\u2019re waiting to turn on again for the next set of clinicals. If that doesn\u2019t develop, there might be a bit of a headwind, but in general North America is steady-eddy. It\u2019s more about Europe in your question. Overall, that is still--it\u2019s okay, I think. Dan Arias : Thanks Chuck. Operator : Thank you. We have the next question from the line of Dan Leonard with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Dan Leonard : Thank you. I wanted to start off, Jim, can I confirm that you said you believe you\u2019ll deliver double-digit growth for the balance of the year, and if that\u2019s the case, that would imply a bigger sequential step-up in Q2 than you typically achieve, so can you talk through the drivers? Jim Hippel : Yes, if you look at our year-over-year comps, first of all, the comps become less of a hurdle year over year as we progress through the year, including next quarter. We\u2019re hopeful that the regional headwinds we faced, mainly in China as well as in Europe for the first two months of the quarter, this quarter will continue to improve. We have a lot of confidence in that with China and so far here in October, we\u2019re seeing more confidence in that with regards to Europe. Had those two regions not underperformed relative to the U.S. and to their historical performance, relative performance, we probably would be talking about double-digit growth in Q1 as opposed to something below that, even with the tough comp. Chuck Kummeth : Yes, especially with the pull forwards. Dan Leonard : Can you elaborate further on how you\u2019re thinking about European macro headwinds? That does seem to be a point of confusion with folks I speak to, given your end market mix. Chuck Kummeth : Yes, sure. Well, we\u2019re seeing cautiousness and we do see some lumpiness, as I mentioned already anyway. We definitely had a weaker than normal July and August across the board - I mean everywhere, so it\u2019s not a systemic issue. September came back gangbusters, but not enough to cover what we saw in July and August, and I would say, well, that\u2019s great, but then October better be hot. October is also looking okay so far, but there is definitely cautiousness. Our teams over there are having issues. We\u2019ve sent over some more help in the field. We were, I would say, in the seventh of so inning of correcting Europe anyway - if you remember, we weren\u2019t that happy with Europe before all this, so I don\u2019t think we\u2019re through that, and we\u2019re focused a lot on our new platforms over there and things like SPD, which had really gone soft in the previous year and now are coming back alive, so we\u2019ll see. Instruments, where I talked about time for signature, it\u2019s delayed longer than usual in our funnel, and we\u2019re trying to get to that. I think it really has been an issue of competing for dollars with other suppliers having finally enough inventory to support things, and I think we were maybe pushed down a little bit this quarter. Our funnel is massive. It\u2019s the best it\u2019s ever been both here and the U.S., and our teams--and believe me, we\u2019ve had some very detailed, we call QBRs, our quarterly business reviews, and they\u2019re adamant that the funnel and the pipeline looks great and demand is solid. It\u2019s just taking longer to get the capital signatures. Dan Leonard : Appreciate that color, Chuck. Thank you. Chuck Kummeth : There is also, as I mentioned too, we definitely had some SimplePlex--you know, a lot of our clinicals are very large cartridge buys, and there was some timing issues in there. Like I said, if these bounce back like we think - you know, they come on and they come off and they come back on, [indiscernible] more or less, that will help as well, so. Dan Leonard : Understood, thank you. Operator : Thank you. We have the next question from the line of Jacob Johnson with Stephens. Please go ahead. Anna : Hi, it\u2019s Anna on for Jacob. Good morning. Can you just update us on the EPI test? I think you\u2019re close to getting reimbursement for annual testing and use of the surveillance [indiscernible]. Where do you stand on the business development effort around this? Chuck Kummeth : Yes, we got it. More or less, it was a long laundry list of reconsideration items over the last two years. We got everything we wanted back to match the NCCN guidelines about one issue, and that\u2019s the negative biopsy, so we\u2019re really good to go and that more or less doubles the TAM. The numbers are going up dramatically. Jim pointed out the numbers - we\u2019re seeing hyper growth now, so we\u2019re adding reps, we\u2019ve added--I\u2019m not giving numbers, but we added 25% more reps this last two quarters, so we\u2019re on fire. The new leadership team there over the last six months or so has been amazing. We\u2019ve done everything. We\u2019re changing our message to lining up with Cal Ripken Jr. again, a lot of shows, but we are just ready to publish the next--the 2.5 year outcome study, which is like 1,000 patients. That\u2019s the big event waiting for the rest of the big guys out there in insurance. We\u2019ve got Humana but we\u2019re after United and the rest of Blues and all these, and we\u2019re knocking on the door. It\u2019s coming. Anna: You talk about exosome as a platform that could be a billion revenue unicorn. Now that you\u2019ve partnered off ExoTru, what are you working on next there? Chuck Kummeth : About six things : multi-variable, there\u2019s a bunch of things I won\u2019t get into, but we can one-on-one, so we\u2019ve got a strong hopper. One reason we did license off the ExoTru was because we have a strong hopper of things also to work on. We can\u2019t work on them all and launch them all ourselves, so, but we have strong interest and a good channel partner that has strength in their area, like Thermo does, with ExoTru--you know, we\u2019re going to do that. But we have a lot of stuff coming, so Sj\u00f6gren's is just the tip of the iceberg. It\u2019s a great example of things we can launch and get out there. The statements about a billion dollar platform is about five to 10 years out when there\u2019s at least a dozen different indications out there, which we think we\u2019ll have. They won\u2019t all be done by us. There will be a mix of partnerships and some driven by us. It\u2019s the future of liquid biopsy, so write it down. You can look back 10 years and say we said so. Anna: Thanks Chuck. Operator : Thank you. We have the next question from the lien of Alex Nowak with Craig Hallum. Please go ahead. Alex Nowak : Great, good morning everyone. I wanted to expand on that softness in bulk purchasing that you mentioned, Chuck. I know you just spoke to Dan about the European summer vacations, but do you think any of the weakness there in the bulk purchase side is just related to just being less dollars out there for biotech projects? I know one of your peers this morning in biotech manufacturing reported--they cited some short term cash sensitivity decisions by biotech customers, so just more detail what you\u2019re hearing out there in the field around dollars. Chuck Kummeth : Yes, well we separate our run rate into, we call larger orders and smaller orders, and our large orders are something over $10,000, and those are either pharma-related larger orders or larger biotech orders, or bulks. The bulks are on a special volume curve, so not a pricing impact so that doesn\u2019t explain that, but on everything else but the bulks, I think what you just said is very possible, an issue that\u2019s happened.  We are seeing slowness to purchase and some push-outs on a lot of these orders, and being told such, that the demand is not going away but they\u2019re watching their dollars. There\u2019s kind of a cash crunch right now, and I think we have--probably it\u2019s uncomfortable to tell us that maybe we were de-prioritized versus getting in with an instrument that they couldn\u2019t get for the last nine months because of supply chain issues from somebody else or whatever. We\u2019ve had no issues and everybody knows we\u2019re steady and we can deliver, and our on-time delivery records are at record levels and we\u2019re unique out there. We\u2019ve never had one supply chain issue through this whole COVID mess to speak of, so of anything material, we sell. The team\u2019s been outstanding. Jim Hippel : I\u2019ll just add, Chuck, we\u2019re hearing from our commercial teams, it\u2019s not so much--it\u2019s not that we\u2019re losing any kind of bulk orders or instrument orders, it\u2019s more about delay in getting them through the system. Alex Nowak : Okay, understood. That\u2019s helpful.  Then maybe just thinking--taking that commentary and then applying it to the expense growth that you\u2019re expecting for the year, how are you thinking about hiring, and then also has the employment market eased up here a bit or is it still pretty tight for talent? Chuck Kummeth : Yes, great question. I had a long career at 3M which had a lot of operations management in a low growth company, so I know how to pull triggers on and off, and I know how to deal with things when they slow down or whatever. Attrition has been more or less a nightmare for us and everybody, and so we are still full steam ahead. Part of our margin impact has been the catch-up in hiring, and so we\u2019re still looking at doing that, so we\u2019re really hiring hard in SVD, hiring still in China. China is lighting it up again. Namocell, our new acquisition, we\u2019ve almost doubled their headcount in the six months we\u2019ve owned them, but in other areas that we\u2019re maybe looking softer to antibodies [indiscernible] we talked about this quarter, we\u2019re looking at mission critical needs and replacements and looking at as we expand. As businesses grow, they need people. If they\u2019re not growing, they\u2019re going to need less people. We are still on a track--we added 300 people net last year, I\u2019d be shocked if we didn\u2019t add 300 net this year, to be honest, so. We\u2019ve got a cautious outlook in some areas. We\u2019re looking at all the areas that we manage - we have five divisions and we have roughly a dozen or so business units. As you know, a couple are super important to us - cell and gene therapy, exosomes, and so those are kind of what they need is what they get. Even Asuragen, growing near 25%, lighting it up in Europe, needing people, we\u2019re adding people. I\u2019m more concerned about losing great people and getting behind all this attrition. It is getting better, as you commented and you asked about, much better. People are coming back to work, too, so people are wanting to come back to work finally. Alex Nowak : That is good. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. We have the next question from the line of Catherine Schulte with Baird. Please go ahead. Catherine Schulte : Hey guys, thanks for the questions. First maybe on China, how much of an impact did lockdowns have in the quarter? Are you seeing any impact from the recent lockdowns that have happened, and how do you view that outlook for this upcoming quarter and for the full year? Chuck Kummeth : Yes, well, we were roughly 12 or more full points ahead of last quarter in growth, so we\u2019re on our trek back. We expect mid teens, in that range for this quarter, and on our way back to 25 end of the year as a run rate level. Kind of expecting the year to be roughly 20-ish or so, even with the soft dig-out here from the China lockdowns.  It\u2019s still sporadic; in fact, we\u2019ve got meetings this week where I was trying to get my head of Asia in. He was in Shanghai and he couldn\u2019t get out because he couldn\u2019t get through Canada, through visa issues, so. We just heard Disney locked people in their resort and they won\u2019t let them go because there\u2019s an outbreak or something, so it\u2019s going to be almost building by building, block by block is the way it\u2019s been described to us. It\u2019s not city-wide and it\u2019s not over yet, but I would say it\u2019s drifting slowly towards opening overall. We don\u2019t see Shanghai locking down again, which would hurt our warehouse, so we think we\u2019re still open for business across China.  We talked about the steady improvement in China and we\u2019re on track, if not better than on track for this quarter and beyond. Catherine Schulte : Got it, and then on GMP reagents, you talked about adding some additional proteins by the end of the year. Can you just give us a status update on customers signing on and filling that capacity? Chuck Kummeth : We have not enough whales, a few tunas, and way too many plankton in our customer list, so we\u2019ve got 150 customers that only a handful are really large ones, and obviously the there\u2019s a timing issue, they\u2019re spotty in their orders for their clinicals and such. We are adding people and driving the pipeline and just getting out there, doing more with Wilson Wolfe and our scale ready team to try and get our stuff pulled in, focusing as much on regenerative medicine as we are in cell and gene therapy, because we are the leader in regen medicine for reagents whereas we aren\u2019t in cell and gene therapy, and we have a lot of buy-in there.  A lot of the new products going out are for regen med, so we\u2019ll have the largest portfolio. We do now, but we\u2019ll have the largest in St. Paul as well by the end of the year, we think, of menu items. We\u2019re sampling a lot. People are astounded at the lot to lot consistency in what we have, but end of the day, it\u2019s not the big ticket item for doing a clinical. The reagents are important, they\u2019re critical, but you\u2019re going to have to show more than just price and things to work your way in, and whereas we\u2019re in the pole position in regen but we\u2019re not in cell and gene therapy, so we\u2019re still fighting some big competitors out there with Celgene, [indiscernible] and others, but we\u2019re holding our own and growing nicely and it\u2019s coming, so. Catherine Schulte : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. We have our next question from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Please go ahead. Patrick Donnelly : Hey guys, thank you for taking the questions. Chuck, maybe one for you, another one for you, I should say, on kind of the quarterly cadence. I think you flagged October, I think I heard a high teens in there. Was that specific to protein sciences, and I guess what do you see in there in terms of that sharp recovery? Was it just some push-out? I know you mentioned the vacation issue in Europe. Was it Europe kind of coming back? Maybe just talk about that, that kind of high teens comment in terms of October, where you saw-- Chuck Kummeth : Some was high teens. I think I said double digit to mid teens, maybe there was a high teen or two. Primarily it is around all the different platforms we have in PSS. They are having a good October and still focused more on the U.S. We\u2019re still collecting data here for Europe. Europe is improving, but how could it not improve, so. So yes, strong, proteins for sure, antibodies for sure, assays for sure. Patrick Donnelly : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Then Jim, maybe on the margin side, in spite of the top line being a little softer, you guys managed expenses pretty well. It sounds like you passed a little bit of price to offset. Can you just talk about the margin cadence as we work our way through the year here? Obviously the guidance is holding, but maybe just the levers you have and what you pulled there in the quarter, and how we should think about the go-forward. Jim Hippel : Yes, and it\u2019s really going to be volume leverage that will allow us to continue to expand our margin on a go-forward basis. I think we\u2019ll still have the same headwinds around FX and around that price inflation dynamic, even though we\u2019re covering inflation dollar for dollar. But the investments--you know, as Chuck mentioned earlier, we caught up in a big way in the second half of fiscal year \u201922, particularly in Q4 with our growth investments, and so it\u2019s much more surgical in terms of the investments going forward as opposed to hire everyone you can kind of mentality, as it was the past couple years.  With the growth investments moderating and the volume ramping as we sequentially go through the year, you can expect that leverage to drop to the bottom line and margins to expand. Patrick Donnelly : Helpful, thank you guys. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question and answer session, and I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Chuck Kummeth, CEO for closing remarks. Over to you, sir. Chuck Kummeth : Okay, well thank you. It is interesting that we have a double-digit quarter in our diagnostic reagents division but there are no questions. We had so many quarters and years of negative growth, and this thing is lighting it up as well and small molecule is just on fire, especially in the GMP format for us. The only thing we didn\u2019t cover too much, but more good news there. With that, I\u2019ll end the call and look forward to the one-on-ones the rest of the day, and talk to you next quarter. We\u2019re looking forward to it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the call will be open for questions following management\u2019s prepared remarks. During our Q&A session, please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. I would now like to turn the call over to David Clair, Bio-Techne's Vice President, Investor Relations. David Clair : Good morning and thank you for joining us. On the call with me this morning are Chuck Kummeth, Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Hippel, Chief Financial Officer of Bio-Techne. Before we begin, let me briefly cover our safe harbor statement. Some of the comments made during this conference call may be considered forward-looking statements, including beliefs and expectations about the company's future results, as well as the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and financial results. The company's 10-K for fiscal year 2022 identifies certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements made during this call. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements because of any new information or future events or developments. The 10-K, as well as the company's other SEC filings, are available on the company's website within its Investor Relations section. During the call, non-GAAP financial measures may be used to provide information relevant to ongoing business performance. Tables reconciling these measures to most comparable GAAP measures are available in the company's press release issued earlier this morning on the Bio-Techne Corporation website at www.bio-techne.com. Separately, we will be presenting at the Citi, Cowen, Barclays and KeyBank health care conferences in March. We look forward to connecting with many of you at these upcoming conferences. I will now turn the call over to Chuck. Chuck Kummeth : Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter conference call. In our second quarter of fiscal 2023, we delivered 4% organic growth on top of a challenging year-on-year comp, where we grew 17% in Q2 of last year. One year ago, the life sciences industry was in the midst of an incredibly strong biotech funding environment, spurred by COVID-related vaccine and therapeutic development that drove high equity valuations for smaller firms. It's been well documented that this funding environment has slowed in recent quarters, returning to pre-COVID levels. In Q2, we did experience a divergence in ordering patterns from our biotech end-market versus our larger pharma customer base, which is still very strong. This divergence was seen in certain large bulk reagent orders, which did not repeat this year, and the delay of instrument orders, as conservation of cash becomes more of a priority for our biotech customers. Encouragingly, the underlying research activity that accelerated during the past strong funding environment continues, which is evident in the strength of our bio-pharma research reagent run rate business, continued cell and gene therapy growth and strong utilization trends within our proteomic and analytical tools. Also, the order funnel for our protein and analytical instruments remains full, and we continue to experience record uptake of our ExoDx Prostate test. I will provide additional details on each of these growth drivers later in the call. Before we discuss the results, I'd first like to welcome Shane Bohnen to the leadership team of our new Senior Vice President, General Counsel effective March 3. Shane will be transitioning into this new role from Brenda Furlow who has served as Executive Vice President and General Counsel for the past nine years. The contributions Brenda has made to the company over the last nine years are immeasurable, including establishing Bio-Techne's legal and compliance functions and leading our corporate sustainability initiatives. I wish Brenda the very best in her retirement. Now let's get into the specifics of the quarter, starting with an overview of our performance by geography and end market. In Europe, we drove mid-single digit revenue growth in the quarter, recovering nicely sequentially from the growth rates experienced in Q1. As a reminder, Europe grew in the mid-teens last year on the wave of stronger biotech funding. We see more stability in European end markets as the year progresses and concerns around high energy prices and severe recession have tempered. The team is also nearly finished implementing a new Dublin warehouse to support Mainland Europe and a new ERP system that has been implemented with minimal disruption to our operation. North America is where we saw the biggest impact of lower biotech spend in Q2. However, North America was still able to grow low single digits on top of a prior year comp that experienced greater than 30% growth in bio-pharma and over 20% growth overall. The multiyear growth rates in North America are still double digit and in line with our long-term goals. The consumable run rate business and instrument order book also suggests that underlying research activity is still robust, and this should become more evident as we pass the remainder of last fiscal year's high biotech comps. Moving on to China. I want to first acknowledge the tremendous dedication and resilience of our team there. Following multiple lockdowns, our team has continued to supply the Chinese research market with the proteomic research reagents, analytical tools and spatial biology solutions to enable scientific discoveries in this geography. Now following a change in COVID management strategy by the Chinese government, COVID is spreading rapidly in the country, including within our China team, which is over 90% infected at one point. Thankfully, this does not appear to be a particularly virulent strain and our impacted team members are typically back to the office within five to 10 days. Despite the disruption caused by the rapid spread of COVID, our team in China was still able to produce mid-single digit growth in Q2. After the waves of COVID subside in China, most likely in our fiscal Q4, we believe a full re-opening of our end markets will accelerate faster compared to the government's prior zero-COVID strategy. Positioning Bio-Techne for a sustainable return to our historic 20-plus percent growth rate in this region. Given the proven pent-up demand in past shutdowns in 2020 and the pending RMB1.7 trillion government stimulus, we see a strong Q4 looking ahead. Now let's discuss our growth platform, starting with our Protein Sciences segment, where organic revenue increased 2% for the quarter on top of a strong comp from last year when the segment grew 19%. During the quarter, we continued to gain traction with our portfolio of cell and gene therapy workflow solutions despite a challenging year-on-year comp where we grew our cell and gene therapy business over 80% organically in Q2 of last year and within that, our GMP protein is over 185%. We still grew our cell and gene therapy portfolio over almost 20% in the quarter. Specific to our GMP proteins business, the commercial team did an excellent job growing business with existing customers as well as adding additional accounts during the quarter, culminating in a record quarter for our GMP protein business. The roadmap to adding additional GMP proteins to the menu produced in our state-of-the-art St. Paul manufacturing facility remains on track with plans in place to almost double in the number produced in this facility in the coming months. It's worth noting that GMP protein sales are driving cross-selling activity throughout our portfolio as this growing list of customers are also frequently purchasing additional items, including RUO media, proteins and small molecules. Speaking of small molecules, our GMP small molecules remain key components in the regenerative medicine cell therapy fields as they enable the reprogramming, self-renewal, storage and differentiation processes that are key to these workflows. Our leadership position in regenerative medicine workflow is driving substantial growth in our GMP small molecule business as well as specialty cell culture media, matrices in our portfolio of 19 GMP proteins that are focused to regenerative medicine, including 11 GMP proteins that are only available from Bio-Techne. The growth is so profound in our GMP small molecules that we are drastically expanding our manufacturing capacity in Bristol, UK. Now let's discuss our core portfolio of proteomic research reagents, including the RUO proteins, antibodies and small molecules that are key components to enabling biopharma and academic scientific discoveries. Collectively, our RUO reagents grew in the low teens in Q2 of last year, driven in part by a strong contribution from bulk reagent orders from biotech customers, some of which did not repeat during the quarter. We are very encouraged that excluding these large orders, the performance of our run rate research reagent business remains very healthy, especially in the US. We continue to expand our catalog of research reagents, which now includes over 6,000 proteins, 425,000 antibody variations in a growing small molecule portfolio. For example, during the quarter, we expanded the small molecule portfolio with the launch of our MitoBrilliant fluorescent dyes, enabling the fluorescent labeling and tracking of mitochondria in live and fixed cells. Initial reception to the launch was very strong with the initial production lot of these dyes selling out in the quarter. These dyes, when used with our new RNAscope Plus, small RNA for co-detection gives extremely high resolution at a single cell level and high detects short base RNA. Moving on to the performance of our ProteinSimple branded analytical tools, where the team delivered low single-digit growth in the quarter. Here, we faced a particularly strong year-on-year comp of nearly 30% in the second quarter of prior year, driven by strong adoption among vaccine and monoclonal antibody therapeutic manufacturers for Maurice in the prior period. The rapid installed base growth we delivered over the past few years is leading to a strong consumer growth, as our portfolio of biologics, fully automated Western blots and multiplex immunoassay solutions become fully ingrained in our biopharma and academic customers processes. We are very encouraged that the order funnel across all three of our instrument platforms remains very full, including a record level for our Maurice Biologics instrument, although the biotech funding environment has a length in the closing cycle. Simple Western lead instrument growth as the system's ability to automate the cumbersome and time-consuming Western blots process with a sample in and anther out solution continues to resonate with our biopharma and academic research end markets. Simple Western is turning out to be much more than an automated Western blot replacement with the system's ability to identify and quantify proteins in complex samples like lysates, leading to its use of the quantitative immunoassay platform. This expanded application for the system is driving usage in targeted protein degradation in drug tolerant studies, intracellular signaling the applications and is an alternative to customerized development. We are actively implementing marketing strategies to educate the market on these additional applications. On January 24, we officially launched our next-generation biologics platform, Maurice Flex at the WCBA Conference. As a reminder, we have seen tremendous adoption of the Maurice, since its launch in 2016. With the system's ability to provide protein purity charge and identity in five minutes in an easy-to-use cartridge-based instrument driving robust demand for the platform. Maurice Flex expands on these capabilities, adding icIEF fractionalization capabilities to instrument. Fractionalization is a front-end step in mass spectrometry, where the sample to be analyzed is separated into mixture components based on differences in their size, charge or other characteristics. MauriceFlex addresses the labor-intensive and time-consuming challenges of using legacy fractionation methods, including ion exchange chromatography. This new application allows us to expand Maurice into a new $300 million market. Now for an update on our SimplePlex branded multiplexing immunoassay system Ella. Ella\u2019s ease-of-use sub-picogram sensitivity, smaller footprint and cost advantages continue to draw increased attention from bio-pharma and academic researchers. As our installed base of Ella systems continues to grow, now nearing 1,000 placements and utilization trends remain robust, we opened a new state-of-the-art product innovation and manufacturing facility to meet current and forecasted cartridge demand. This new facility adds laboratory, manufacturing and clean room space and increases cartridge capacity to 500,000 cartridges per year. We also successfully completed the initial ISO 1345 audit of our Wallingford, Connecticut facility as we prepare Ella to make inroads into the large and nascent clinical diagnostics opportunities that exist for the platform. ICL is possibly our largest instrument platform someday. No other tool works so well across both biomarker discovery and diagnostics. Rounding out our instrument platforms, let's now discuss Namocell, our single cell separation and dispensing platform. Recall that we closed on the Namocell acquisition in July of 2022, and we are pleased with growing interest in this novel technology as well as the progress we have made integrating the team and the business. During the quarter, a single-cell cloning workflow publication using the Namocell single-cell isolation and dispensing platform was featured in nature protocols. The study outlines a robust and scale workflow that maximize cell viability for cloning Human Pluripotent Stem Cells, or HPSC using Namocell\u2019s low-pressure microfluidic technology, which ensures gentle and rapid dispensing of cells. We are in the early stages of realizing the potential of the Namocell platform and see a bright future for this technology, having shipped over 100 instruments to-date. Now let's shift to Diagnostics and Genomics segment where we grew revenue by 7% organically in the quarter. Let's start with a discussion of our molecular diagnostics business and the continued adoption of our ExoDx prostate cancer test. During the quarter, the team delivered the fourth consecutive quarter of record test volume as the number of tests reformed increased over 70% and revenue grew over 110% in the quarter. The combination of a strengthened marketing message to the urology community that emphasizes ExoDx is a tool to identify not only the right patients for prostate biopsy, but also drive patient adherence to biopsy recommendations, a four to five and expanded commercial team as well as the favorable impact of our reconsidered local coverage decision, LCD, with our Medicare contractor has driven sustained momentum in the business. We are seeing strong trends across the key performance indicators we track for the ExoDx prostate test, including the number of ordering doctors, the average number of tests ordered per doctor and the number of new doctors over in which all set records in the quarter. We also hired a veteran reimbursement executive with a redesigned game plan to drive favorable coverage decisions within the private payer community. With less than 20% penetration of urologists in the US, who have used the test at least once and the potential to expand the usage of our test among current doctors by 5x, we are positioned to continue the strong growth in this business for the remainder of fiscal 2023 and for the years beyond. Continuing with molecular diagnostics. Asuragen branded genetic carrier screening and oncology kits continue to grow double-digit. During the quarter, Asuragen announced a partnership with Oxford Nanopore Technologies to develop assays designed to deliver more accurate and reliable options for reproductive health and carrier screening. The collaboration combines Asuragen's long-range PCR and Oxford Nanopore's any-read length sequencing capabilities in a single workflow to identify genetic sequence variance in both hard to decipher genes and conventional genes using a single sequencing system. Our spatial biology business, branded ACD, grew mid-single digits in the quarter as a softer biotech market provided some headwinds similar to Protein Sciences. Our professional assay service business had a strong quarter as revenue increased nearly 20% year-on-year. Historically, accounts leveraging ACD's pharma assay services capabilities for biomarker discovery eventually transition into product customers, making strength in the service business a proxy for future product demand. We recently expanded our ACD portfolio with the launch of RNAscope Plus small RNA, enabling the simultaneous fluorescent detection of small regulatory RNA using our new Vivid dyes, including microRNA together with three target RNAs or RNA biomarkers in the same tissue section at single cell and sub-cellular resolution. RNAscope Plus provides gene therapy researchers with a valuable new tool to quantify changes in gene expression and cellular function in response to the introduction of regulatory RNAs, which is essential for optimization efficiency and safety. I would note, RNAscope Plus was initially offered through spatial biology's professional assay services where it saw an overwhelmingly positive customer response. Lastly, we experienced low single-digit growth in our diagnostic reagents and controls business as order timing among a handful of customers impacted the quarter. Looking at this business on a trailing 12-month basis, growth remains in the mid-single digits. With patients returning to their physicians, demand for diagnostic testing is increasing. This favorable macro environment, plus a strong pipeline of additional products positions our diagnostic reagents and controls for future growth. In summary, despite the temporary challenges created by the current biotech funding environment and the COVID impact in China, our team continues to successfully navigate this dynamic environment and grow the business. The long-term tailwinds supporting proteomic scientific research, cell and gene therapies, spatial biology and liquid biopsies remain firmly intact, and our portfolio is ideally suited to capitalize on these opportunities as they shape the future of life science research and health care. The team to execute our strategy is in place at full strength, and we remain well-positioned and more optimistic than ever to deliver on our long-term targets. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim. Jim Hippel : Thanks, Chuck. I will provide an overview of our Q2 financial performance for the total company, provide some additional details on the performance of each of our segments and give some thoughts on the remainder of the fiscal year. Before we get started, I'd like to remind everyone that Bio-Techne executed a four-for-one stock split on November 29, 2022. All references to share and per share amounts have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effects of the stock split. Now let's start with the overall second quarter financial performance. Adjusted EPS was $0.47, consistent with the prior year quarter. Foreign exchange negatively impacted earnings per share by $0.02 or minus 4% in the quarter. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.31 compared to $0.49 in the prior year. The biggest driver for the decrease in GAAP EPS was a nonrecurring gain on our previously held ChemoCentryx investment in the prior year period. Q2 revenue was $271.6 million, an increase of 4% year-over-year on an organic basis and 1% on a reported basis. Foreign exchange translation had an unfavorable impact of 4% and acquisitions had a favorable impact of 1% to revenue growth. As Chuck mentioned, following a period of RedHawk [ph] biotech funding last year, we are seeing a normalization of purchasing trends from these customers. Additionally, COVID is now sweeping through China and slowing the amount of research activity in this region, temporarily impacting the growth of our proteomic research reagents, analytical tools and spatial biology products. Adjusting our organic growth rate for large orders from a handful of biotech customers that did not repeat and normalizing for China, our organic growth would have been double digits in the quarter. Summarizing our organic growth by region and end market in Q2. North America grew low single digits, Europe grew mid single-digits, China grew mid single-digits, while APAC was flat due to prior year government stimulus in Japan not repeating this year. By end market, biopharma grew low single-digits, while academic grew mid single-digits. We are encouraged by the revenue growth from our large pharma customers as well as the underlying health of the overall bio-pharma end market as is reflected in the continued strong momentum in our run rate business. For academia, we are encouraged by the recent NIH outlay data, which showed a 13% year-over-year increase in our second quarter. We anticipate this strong NIH allay begin to work its way through the system and benefit academic life science research spending in the near term. Additionally, the 5.6% NIH budget increase and 50% ARPA-H budget increase for the federal government's fiscal 2023, sets the stage for a healthy academic end market for the remainder of our fiscal year. Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin was 71.7% in the quarter compared to 72.3% in the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by unfavorable foreign exchange. Adjusted SG&A in Q2 was 27.9% of revenue compared to 26.5% in the prior year, while R&D expense in Q2 was 8.3% of revenue compared to 7.5% in the prior year. The increase in SG&A and R&D was driven by wage inflation and the acquisition of Namocell. The business has implemented strategic price increases during the first half of fiscal year 2023 to offset the dollar impact of inflation and operating income. However, the dollar for dollar offset did have a negative impact on operating margin. Adjusted operating margin for Q2 was 35.5%, a decrease of 280 basis points from the prior year period. Negative FX impact decreased margin by 100 basis points, the pricing inflation dynamic decreased adjusted operating margin by another 50 basis points. While the acquisition of Namocell and timing of other fiscal year 2022 growth investments drove the remainder of the margin dilution for the quarter. For the remainder of the year, we expect adjusted operating margins to continue to expand sequentially, ending the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023, up to 100 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022. Looking at our numbers below operating income. Net interest expense in Q2 was $1.2 million, decreasing $1.3 million compared to the prior year period. Our bank debt on the balance sheet at the end of Q2 stood at $200 million, a decrease of $64.7 million compared to last quarter. Other adjusted net operating income was flat in the quarter, an increase of $1.2 million compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting the foreign exchange impact related to our cash pooling arrangements. Moving further down the P&L, our adjusted effective tax rate in Q2 was 21%. Turning to cash flow and return of capital. $64.3 million of cash was generated from operations in the quarter and our net investment and capital expenditures was $6.1 million. Also during Q2, we returned capital to shareholders by way of 12.5 million in dividend. Following our four-for-one stock split, we finished the quarter with 161.8 million average diluted shares outstanding. Our balance sheet finished Q2 in a very strong position with $196.8 million in cash and short-term available-for-sale investments bringing our net debt position very close to zero. Going forward, M&A remains a top priority for capital allocation. Next, I'll discuss the performance of our reporting segments, starting with the Protein Sciences segment. Q2 reported sales were $203.9 million, with reported revenue decreasing 1%. Organic growth for the segment was 2% with foreign exchange having an unfavorable impact of 4% and acquisitions contributing 1%. Despite the temporary headwinds and the tough year-over-year comps that Chuck pointed out for this segment, I will highlight that the longer term five-year organic CAGR for this segment is approximately 11%. Operating margin for the Protein Sciences segment was 43.8%, a decrease of 170 basis points year-over-year with operational productivity more than offset by foreign exchange, price inflation dynamics and the impact of Namocell acquisition. Turning to the Diagnostics and Genomics segment, Q2 reported sales were $68 million with reported revenue increasing 5%. Organic growth for the segment was 7% with foreign exchange having unfavorable 2% impact. As you heard from Chuck earlier, our Exosome Diagnostics business remained incredibly strong in the quarter, as our fortified marketing message and strengthened commercial team continue to drive test volume and revenue growth. Our spatial biology business grew mid-single digits in the quarter, with strong performance in our professional assay services and microRNA businesses, partially offset by order timing from a few bio-pharma customers. Moving on to the Diagnostics and Genomics segment operating margin at 12.2%, the segment operating margin decreased 470 basis points compared to the prior year. The segment's operating margin was unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange, price inflation dynamics and the timing of strategic growth investments. As we think about the setup for the second half of our fiscal year, it is important to reflect on the drivers of our performance in the first half relative to our expectations at the beginning of the year. Our Q1 relative performance was muddled by the pent-up vacation activity we saw from our customers, as well as heightened inflationary and recessionary concerns, especially in Europe. In Q2, we saw the slowing of large orders from our biotech customers that possibly could have been foreshadowed by the slowdown in biotech funding earlier in the calendar year. However, the impact to our business was not realized until the December quarter just ended. And throughout the entire first half of our fiscal year 2023, the COVID situation in China has been on a roller coaster with rolling government-mandated shutdown and now widespread infections. Despite all of this, as Chuck and I have expressed on this call, we believe our end markets are still very healthy, and our portfolio positioning is still very strong. Big pharma demand is high. Academic research budgets are on the rise, and most biotechs are not broke, just being more prudent. And finally, China appears to be closer to the end of the COVID roller coaster than ever before with pent-up demand and strong Chinese government stimulus setting up for what could be an incredible calendar year 2023. But we need to get through the March ended quarter, our fiscal Q3 first, and right now, it appears as though our organic growth this quarter will be similar to that of Q2. People in China are still sick with COVID and in Protein Sciences, we know of several large biotech orders that occurred last year in Q3 that are unlikely to repeat this year. Also in Q3, we will be lapping the large milestone payment realized in our Diagnostics and Genomics segment from the ExoTRU kidney transplant rejection assay licensing agreement made with Thermo Fisher last year. As we lap these difficult year-over-year comps, the normalization of biotech funding runs its course and COVID headwinds alleviate in China, we anticipate organic growth to improve significantly in Q4, positioning the company for continued progress on delivering our long-term strategic and financial targets. That concludes my prepared comments. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Puneet Souda with SVB Securities. Please proceed with your question. Puneet Souda : Yes, hi Chuck, Jim, thanks for taking the question. So, first one, Chuck, I think it would be helpful if you could parse out a little bit more on the impact from the emerging biotechs. Are these smaller emerging biotechs, I think Jim said they're not going broke, but the number of projects are lower. But could you -- if you could describe a little bit more into that? And then is this a spreading to larger bio-pharma -- or the bio-pharma remains largely intact? And then how much of this is sort of COVID adjacencies. And if you could parse out what were -- what segments or what type of products were these sort of bulk orders and then, again, I appreciate that this is comp-related normalization that you're expecting. But I think the question is sort of how long do you think this can last in duration because obviously, funding concerns were -- they're here now. But just wondering how long will it be before -- sort of we see improvement here in a meaningful way? Chuck Kummeth : Okay. I'll try to cover that in less than 20 minutes. Thanks, Puneet. As the quarter finished, we are a little ejected. It's my 40th quarter, and it's been a few years since we've seen a growth rate like this. But as we look back into the data, man, we saw some amazing things. One, our run rate business, most of our business, both -- here in Europe was double-digit. Very strong end markets there, academia about the same, no real issues there. Biotech funding, we've -- as I mentioned last, we started digging in more and more about just how much are we becoming more of a front-end research company supporting our customers as we mitigated from academia to bio-pharma. But within that bio-pharma, how much is really biotech. And with that biotech, how much are really new biotech and start-ups and fresh research and leading-edge stuff. And it's about 30% is the number. About 20-some of most of our businesses has been in instruments, it's about 40%. And then -- and I think that's it's a funding issue right now. And as we dig in more, it's going to wash through, but there is definitely a growth being prudent. Their funding is solid right now, but they're trying to make things last. If you're further along in clinical, as you're probably okay, because it's committed. And if you're doing -- if you're a startup, there's actually funding. If you're kind of out there, but looking for your second round, it's tough right now, and it's just the way it is. So that long -- that's driven a lot of potential growth in OEM and a lot of larger orders as people are -- were starting these clinicals and doing special things with us. And there are a lot of one-off comps. Literally, it's a handful of deals that bring us back to like double-digit growth. It's kind of incredible. Now, talking about bio-pharma, the pharma side with you, that's just more about overall conservatism in general and the overhang of COVID, like vaccine makers, just the gravies over here, right? So it's just kind of a normalization, not long term, just kind of renormalizing and just, again, a little longer out for things and waiting things. And we get that vindicated to by looking at our funnel instruments. It's larger than it's ever been. Our instrument funnel is tremendous. It's just the conversion rate has slowed down a lot, as getting capital has been -- has gotten tighter for teams looking to buy instruments in our segments. And we see that flowing through as well. China will explode in Q4. I think, it may be a little better this quarter. We actually had mid-single-digit growth. I don't know how. There wasn't anybody working in the whole quarter, practically, but we still had growth. It will come back with a roar, I think, and we've seen that before. And we also have the government stimulus hitting and should be kicking in by Q4. The tenders are going out now, we've had that vindicated. So it should be a one-two punch there for China by Q4. I think that may cover most of your questions. Did I miss any? Puneet Souda : Yes. No, I think you covered it well, Chuck. Thanks for that. And just -- I'll keep it very simple for Jim. Just on 4Q, I appreciate your comments on Q3 being similar to 2Q. But 4Q, just even if I have double-digit increases there, I'm landing for the full year and single -- in single digits, so for total organic growth. So just wondering, does the aspiration for 15% or mid-teens sort of growth rate longer term still intact. If you could elaborate a bit on that. Thanks, so much. Jim Hippel : Yes, they are still intact. And, yes, the math would suggest that likely not hit double-digit growth for the year this year, even if we hit double-digit growth for Q4. But as I mentioned in my opening comments, if you look at it from a multi-year CAGR, we're still in the low teens and would probably end of the year still in the low teens on a multi-year basis. And that's essentially on track to where we said we'd be at this point in our five-year journey. So the mid-year -- the mid-teens is the average over five years, but again, as the cell and gene therapy continues to ramp and become more material for our business, particularly the GMP proteins, as well as the Exosome becomes more material to our business and continues at those kind of growth rates, and as Chuck alluded to, that we're still barely scratching the surface of the potential there, that's what kicks us into the mid- to higher teens growth rates later on in our five-year plan. So as far as we see it, we're still on track. Operator : Our next question comes from Jacob Johnson with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Jacob Johnson : Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Maybe kind of first question, kind of dovetailing Jim and Chuck on what Jim was just talking about. You're still targeting this $2 billion of revenue by FY 2026. I do think in your new deck, maybe you moderated some of your expected growth for instruments and on the spatial side. Can we just touch on kind of your latest thoughts on the path to $2 billion by FY 2026, once we get beyond some of these kind of near-term dynamics that you discussed? Thanks. Chuck Kummeth : Yes. We're not coming off that at all. I think the ink isn't even dry on our last analysis. I mean the bottom line is we got way ahead of the curve and I had a forecast last couple of years right in COVID and some of that's re-normalized, but we're still safely in the $2 billion number, we think. A couple of reasons, look at some reflex coming out. We're going to be now attacking $400 million market, $300 million in the HPLC market, for fractionization, just skipping whole while seeing right to mass spec, which can save weeks and months of work in an analytical lab at biopharma customers. And also the protein characterization market, it's a small market, $100 million but peptide mapping is a very important process, and we -- this machine can do that. And so it's going to grow in that category along with everything else that's been doing. It's been -- and things are picking up in cell and gene therapy for being spec-ed in for just good old-fashioned QC for purity, et cetera. ELA is just going to be on fire. We're doing about 90,000 cards a year now. We just finished the factory for 500,000 cards. We've got 1,345 coming. It's just almost done, and we're going to have diagnostic research coming out of our ears, we think, on top of biomarker discovery. So, this is going to be a platform that's going to get bigger than I think we have in our $2 billion model. I can go up and down this, but we're also, I think, possibly light on exosomes. Exosome is screaming now, 100% plus a quarter a scene in sight. We have a nice portfolio of new diagnostics, new tests coming out where we've got partners calling, the team is doing great. We've got a great new team with a new executive for the payer strategy on someone who's actually connected. And we've made more progress with private payers last quarter that we've made the last two years, to be honest. So, hopefully, more on that coming soon as we put some numbers to it. So, the end answer for you is all the stuff that we are waiting to start growing. And then by the way, cell and gene therapy, proteins on top of 185% comps still grew almost 20% this quarter. Nothing is slowing down here. All this new stuff start to pick up, but our core, which is the biggest part hit a speed bump because of the OEM and the biotech funding issues, which is going to recover quickly. We need this new stuff because that's how we get to high double-digit growth, as Jim alluded to, but it's picking up. but it's going to happen. And cell and gene therapy, a $100 million portfolio for us right now, growing to $2 billion in the next 8 to 10 years. So, we're not letting up. I don't see any issue right now at all. It's the things we put in place years ago are starting to happen, and we're going to have some bumps here and there with the kind of growth rates we have. I do think we kind of must the forecast for sure. I mean we did not appreciate -- fully appreciate the comps and the strong growth we had last couple of years due to COVID. We tried to level it out by averaging over the couple of years, as Jim pointed out, and I think the recovery will be good. Our brands, we've just done brand studies, R&D systems, still number one. Bio-Techne is actually moving right up the ladder two after 10 years of being out there. We've got great association. We keep investing digitally, and that's continued to pay back. There's no issue to back off the $2 billion. It's just that we probably aren't as safely in the block of hitting it as we were, but I think we're still there. And Namocell is going to be in the mix now too, so. Jacob Johnson : Got it. Thanks for that Chuck. And then just the other big picture question. I heard Jim mention that I think M&A is the number one priority on the capital allocation side. So, I think that speaks to appetite. But maybe just kind of any thoughts on where seller expectations are in the current environment and any areas of interest? Chuck Kummeth : Well, time heals all here. So valuations have come down. They've come down all year, but there's still denial, but there's less denial. There's not a robust IPO market right now. So small companies have limited options. We talked about the funding issues, right? So that means a lot of small companies are going to be looking for ways out and help. So our phone is ringing more than it was. We're very active. We've been active, but we're definitely more active than usual. And I hope we can land a few more. We landed Namocell not too long ago, and we've got some more in the pipeline. And yes, it is our number one capital strategy. We're at net debt zero. We've got \u2013 we've got a $1.5 billion work chest rate to go with cash, and we'd love to put it to work. I don't think we'll go over four times leverage, but I'm going to get up near that. Board is very supportive of us getting much more aggressive in M&A. But it's like what you \u2013 the \u2013 your question is all about the price tags, right? And we've got to get real price tags to get to make to close some deals. Operator : Our next question comes from Dan Arias with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Dan Arias : Good morning, guys. Thanks for the questions. Chuck, on GMP proteins. Can you just refresh your view on how you think growth shapes up there, when you guys are opening up to St. Paul facility, you talked about expecting a couple of years where revenue basically doubles. It sounds like you dipped a little bit below that, but maybe now you're accelerating again. So what do you think the trajectory there is relative to the overall capacity, which I think at the time of like $140 million to $200 million? Chuck Kummeth : Yeah, there's a little bit of overlap, even in this \u2013 in the area we'd call OEMs. So we've got a lot of customers like 180 customers now for gene proteins, but only a handful that are really sizable and they're a little bit lumpy still. We have some year-on-year comps in the area, they are tough as well. Even there, we still had a pretty good quarter, I'd say. And going forward, I think it is going to accelerate. We added another product to the same St. Paul were its fixed. We'll more than double that in the coming year. We have the largest menu for regenerative medicine, and we're moving with most of those over the St. Paul facility in the coming year or two as well. And we're number one there. We're playing catch-up still in the CAR T area, but it's growing strong. It's still kind of, I think, going to be a double kind of year, maybe just a hair under this year, but it won't be too far off, we don't think. And next year should start lighting up as we land a few more larger accounts and we get some things further up in the clinicals to get more volume going. We call it turning minerals in the tunes and tunes in the whales. So we have a whole pipeline of how we move these customers forward. More of indication, we had a few of these customers are fairly sizable, and they went to zero, because their funding is tight right now. So they're going to probably come back online next year, we think, as they get more funding, but they've had some stalls in some of their clinicals. These are small to mid-range biotechs that were kind of hot last year and not so hot this year. They're customers. We're also seeing that with Wilson Wolf as well. It's definitely slowed down, seeing the same thing. Area isn't anybody who has a business that's really in the CAR T, in the biotech side in clinical, I can't say the same thing. It's just honest to God, true. There are things have slowed down. There is less funding and there are less clinical starting, and that's just reality. I don't think it's long term. I think it's just a blip for this year, but it's a reality. Dan Arias : Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess, I need to go back to the long-term targets here just because \u2013 in order to hit that 17% organic growth CAGR that you laid out for 2021 through 2026 and that gets you to the $2 billion at least by my math, you basically have to do a couple of years of 20% growth. And one of the things that we're talking about is how hard comps can be. So apologies for beating a dead horse here, but I guess I just have to ask explicitly if that's at all a decent way to think about out-year growth? Chuck Kummeth : Well, the OEM side of things was bad enough and just on a handful of deals where it took our antibody and our protein business to near to about flat. And that's a short-term blip. We need mid-level, mid-digit growth in that category. We've had way higher than that for the last two years, and in fact, double digit, so I'm not too worried about that. It's more an issue about the back end and making sure that both cell and gene therapy and exosome as a platform can get to 45% to 50% growth in that range. That's what's got to happen. Everything else is within the air bars easily to hit there, but we've got to get to that level. And then we've got a couple more years to get to that point. I don't think we're shook about it. Things can only grow so fast, and we're kind of growing pretty fast. Jim Hippel : I'd say I just add that a little bit on. I mean, as I -- we mentioned in the call earlier, in literally a handful of customers, biotech customers, smaller biotech customers was a difference between double-digit growth and mid single-digit growth for us this past quarter. So that's how quickly it can flip the other direction as well when things come back online. Operator : Our next question comes from Dan Leonard with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Dan Leonard : Hi. Thank you. Chuck, in the past, you've talked about hiring challenges as being a gating factor to your growth and wanting to hire more. Can you give us an update on trends there? Are you still planning aggressive hiring, or have you moderated your ambitions there? Chuck Kummeth : No, it's a very insightful question. And I didn't bring it up on the call, but it is more late-breaking news, but we definitely had turnover in our sales force in the biologic platform area. As you know, a lot of instrumentation, things that were not in pretty hot still, larger metal things. And there's been a lot of attrition, and we lost a fair number of people. We're at full strength again, but there's definitely a component there. On spatial, we've come all the way back, I think, really down to one. Overall, we're riding our attrition to kind of stay leaner here as we ride through it. You saw our margins are held pretty well. We're on track. Part of that is that we've just not replaced everything through attrition. We had a pretty big spend plan for this year for this plan to hit these double-digit targets and they're not there. So we pulled back like any good operator would. I think we'll end up the year up 100 to 200 people, but not the 300 to 400. I think the salespeople is the biggest risk. I think there is a productivity hit we probably took in the last quarter or two off of 1,000 people turning over last year, a full third of the company that is probably unappreciated. And that will also level out going forward. But we're watching that very carefully. We're working it hard. We're changing. We've done a lot of market upgrades as wage inflation is a big hit. I mean, I think we've done a remarkable bottom line considering all the wage inflation we've actually had to absorb this past year. And we're on fighting it like everybody else. But we have a great portfolio, a lot of great sexy new products in our road map, and we're still in the business of helping people and helping people develop drugs, and that interests a lot of people to come on board. Demographically, we're a much younger company now than were three, four, five years ago and that makes you want to have more changes too. ESG is very important to us here. We have a lot of different new groups and clubs and dealing with different levels of diversity. The company has never been more focused on that. We're over 50% female in our management. We're 25% Chinese. So we've got a -- award this year for our diversity and stuff. So we're focused on all that. But youth and diversity are key in managing. That is a key to attrition, I think. Puneet Souda : Appreciate all that color, Chuck. And my follow-up question on China, I'm not sure I know how to quantify the word explode, but when it comes to the RMB1.7 trillion loan package. What are you seeing on the leading indicators on that? Are you seeing quote activity tied to that spend? Are you seeing RFPs? Is there anything that gives you confidence that money is going to start flowing beginning that June quarter? Chuck Kummeth : I had a meeting on that, just asking those very same questions with the leadership in Asia. And, yes, tenders are going out and there is discussion. So it looks like it's very real. It's about a two-month process so I don't think we'll see much of that here in Q3. It's a Q4 activity. We kind of have them at over 100% to plan in Q4. Of course, they're trying to negotiate that. But I think it's well over 100%. If there's a reality around this RMB1.7 trillion stimulus, which is really instrument driven, then it will be real. I think there's pent-up demand already. We're already -- we had mid-single-digit growth the last quarter with nobody working. So I think it will be a quick comeback story. We have data on that, right? This happened two years ago as well after the COVID quarter, and I think it will be similar. And government is very focused on prioritizing healthcare. I mean that's what the stimulus is for. I don't think anything changes there. People just got to get back to work. Kind of tough to read right now, too, because they're just coming off a new year now, right? So they just come back to work, I think, this week even so. And we're coming back fast. I mean, we had the whole office. 90% of our people are sick at the same time. Like within a two-week period, they all got hit, that was actually similar anywhere in Shanghai. Jim Hippel : Customers the same way. Chuck Kummeth : So in customers, too. So it's going to snap back pretty fast, we think, unless there's some new variant. But I asked questions about that too. About when do they expect the second wave and they don't really expect one for a while. According to the people we talk to, everyone's already got it. Operator : Our next question comes from Catherine Schulte with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Catherine Schulte : Hey guys, thanks for the questions. I guess first, Jim, just circling back, you said adjusted for China and RUO region bulk ordering organic growth would have been double digits. Can you just quantify the bulk ordering portion? It seems like China is maybe a two-point headwind in bulk orders, four points or maybe a little bit more. Is that the right -- about the right ballpark? And then can you just quantify any bulk purchasing activity in the third or fourth quarter of last year, just as we think about comps heading into the back half of the year? Jim Hippel : So yeah, your percentages are pretty close to what we show as well. And yes, that's why we said we expect Q3 to be very similar to Q2 in terms of organic growth because the number of one-time bulk orders from these small biotechs was similar to Q2, perhaps a little bit less, but also keep in mind that we had the very large ExoTRU licensing agreement with Thermo Fisher in our Q3. We knew \u2013 we didn't know all along that Q3 was going to be our most challenging growth quarter because of that very large ExoTRU agreement that occurred. So that's an additional headwind that we didn't have. But we think with the overall momentum of the business, we'll be able to cover some of that sequentially, so that sequentially our growth rates will be similar. Catherine Schulte : Okay. Got it. And then can you just talk to the rebound in Europe. On your last earnings call, you talked about September being up double digits and that strength continuing into October. So can you just walk through how things unfolded throughout the rest of the quarter? Chuck Kummeth : Yes, it was definitely a story of Europe doing better than the US and from last quarter. We had run rates 12% plus in Europe. Overall, it was about a mid- to high single-digit kind of level in Europe. So, a good recovery, not all the way back, we want, but remember they were negative last quarter. So, that was good. We have new management, hopefully going into place soon. There as well working on that. We didn't talk about -- we put in a whole new ERP system and without a glitch. So, we're -- that's all coming online. We have a whole new warehousing system in Dublin now to supporting Mainland Europe, and that's coming online with no glitches. So, been a lot of good things in Europe as well. Going forward, I think the risk of the war and energy in Europe, the winter and stuff has been mitigated pretty well. So, we're kind of focused on really getting the teams up to speed, new management in place, completing the mission on cross-selling and the commercialization strategies and tactics that we were in the middle of doing before COVID hit and all that. And funding seems reasonable in Europe, country-by-country. We're still weaker in Germany than we want to be. We always have been. So, we're really focused on trying to build on Germany more going forward. I think that's key. I think there's a risk in the UK given Brexit still, but so far, so good, but I guess I'd answer it that way for now. Europe is out of the hot seat from last quarter. Now, we got OEM issues in the US to deal with. Operator : Our next question comes from Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Patrick Donnelly : Hey guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Jim, maybe kind of a follow-up on one of the earlier questions in terms of headcount. As you guys kind of see the growth slowing for a little bit, obviously talked about 3Q being in this area as well. How are you thinking about managing expenses? How are you thinking about the margin cadence? How nimble can you guys be in terms of protecting the bottom line. I guess the margin has held up pretty well this quarter relative to the topline. So, just curious how you're thinking about that piece and if you're changing any growth investments or any way you're thinking about the P&L? Jim Hippel : Yes, I mean as we've talked about the last couple of quarters. We were behind in our investment -- investments and hiring for the most of fiscal year 2022 and even really fiscal year 2021. And we made great progress in catching up in those investments and catching up on that head count in Q4 in particular. And that's been a reason for our margin drag. One of the reasons for our margin drag in the first half of the year. And I think we've also been fairly public about this in the past where -- not just us, but everyone was dealing with retention issues for the last year and a half. And when you took about 3,000 employees that we ended the year at a relatively still at today, roughly a 1,000 of those employees have been hired in the last year because of both new hires but also replacements of loss folks. So, that's a huge, huge influx of new people in the organization that need to get up to speed and frankly, get productive. And so we're really focusing on getting the productivity of those folks we hired last year. And so that's really the focus of this year, which is why there's not a lot of new hiring happening nor needed. That being said, there are strategic investments we're making, particularly around our Molecular Diagnostics division to support the amazing growth we're seeing in our prostate test there. And there's a few other R&D programs that were slowing down just a bit, just to catch up from all the hiring we did last year, but nothing that's going to have any issue with our long-term growth plans. Chuck Kummeth : Well, let me interject here. Remember, one of our reasons for being successful over the last 10 years, I think, is our prioritization process. We've talked about it a lot. A lot of you have had the short course meeting with us offline. And it allows us to change priorities and change mix of people and programs very quickly. We do a zero-based every year. And we're already in the middle of that in making those changes. So we've doubled the size of our Namocell team since we hired them. We are adding people, we're up 50% in headcount in our exosome teams in the last years because we're waiting for trigger points to happen. They happen. We told you we'd start investing when we saw that. The reconsiderations went through. Urologists are seeing patients again, and we're lighting it up. So we're adding a lot of people there, but we're changing the mix and some other things. We're holding off and some things that are just prudent to do right now until we see a reason to change. Remember all -- myself and all of our leaders all come from working in large companies, all run billion-dollar-plus P&Ls, every one of them. They know how to operate. Jim Hippel : No, that's a great point, Chuck. We are actively reallocating resources towards those higher growth platform. So it's our prioritization process at work real-time. And as that relates to margins and by holding our overall cost base, we're relatively neutral, maybe a slight uptick throughout the year, but relatively neutral for the remainder of the year. Anyone who follows our business knows that our second half is. From a revenue perspective, seasonality-wise is much stronger than our first half, simply because our customers are at the bench more days than they are in the first half of the year without all the vacation interruption. That additional revenue on top of that same cost base should allow our margins to continue to expand sequentially. Chuck Kummeth : And by the way, people are coming back to work here. Patrick Donnelly : Yeah. Got you Chuck, and then maybe one on Wilson Wolf. Can you just refresh us in terms of the milestones and timing there? Has anything changed as your conviction and going forward with that change and all? Chuck Kummeth : We're running out of time, so I got to move fast here. They've slowed down, too. But as you know, the targets are $92 million in revenue or $55 million in EBITDA for the first tranche. They're very close on one of them. And we may strike soon, we may choose to wait. It's as much strategic as it is anything else. We've got the cash, we were ready to go. So we might choose this to weigh in and go sooner than later. We're not sure yet. But it's very -- we're getting close to trigger. I got to believe in the next things pick up at all for them, we're going to hit it soon. If they don't pick up, but it might be in the couple of quarters. But we're within our sights here. Nothing has changed strategically. Nothing has changed culturally, nothing has changed in the relationship. The teams are tighter than ever. If anything, they're pushing to get closer and get this to happen. So a great question. It's looming, and I can't wait. Operator : Our next question comes from Justin Bowers with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Justin Bowers : Hey good morning, Chuck and everyone. Just one here on China. Just -- is there a way to parse out how much of the slowdown was between the consumables versus the instrument business? And the second part to that would be in terms of the seamless funding coming on, do we have a sense of the duration of that, i.e., will that be a tailwind to calendar year 2024 as well based on some of your conversations? Chuck Kummeth : I think stimulus in the US, or anything related to that is here and gone. I think the OEM comments are more about consumables and the instruments are slow to basically of just prudent conservatism buying biotech and biopharma and funding in general. So it fits more funding on the instrument side and the conservatism and OEM is more on the consumable side. Well, in China, China is just they're not at work. They'll be screaming back here very soon. I'm not worried. Jim Hippel : Yes, I'd say the slowdown from our, call it, 20% plus normalized growth to mid single-digit growth was across the board in both instruments and consumables. And rains to be seen how long the stimulus impact last, but it's going to take more than a quarter to spend that much stimulus in our opinion. So I think for the one point, it will be a multi-quarter, if not a year in benefit. Chuck Kummeth : It will be this whole calendar year. They're intending it for that. They're intending it for health care. They're intending it to be in hardware more than anything else. And we play big there. We're about productivity and hardware. So we've got more platforms than ever. So we're going to share in that as well. I mean just to put that into scope, it's 1.7, if that's the real number, that's way bigger than our entire NIH budget. So it's going to be good. It would be good for everybody. Operator : We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the floor back over to management for concluding comments. Chuck Kummeth : All right. Well, thanks, everyone. We'll see at the end of next quarter. I think we were as transparent as we can be. We've been doing this a long time together as a team, and we'll always be transparent. Things still look really good here. We don't see any change in our thesis. And anyway, I see the future is bright, we think. So we'll talk to you soon. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note today\u2019s event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to David Clair. Please go ahead. David Clair : Good morning and thank you for joining us. On the call with me this morning are Chuck Kummeth, Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Hippel, Chief Financial Officer of Bio-Techne. Before we begin, let me briefly cover our Safe Harbor statement. Some of the comments made during this conference call may be considered forward-looking statements, including beliefs and expectations about the company\u2019s future results as well as the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and financial results. The company\u2019s 10-K for fiscal year 2022 identify certain factors that could cause the company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements made during this call. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements because of any new information or future events or developments. The 10-K as well as the company\u2019s other SEC filings, are available on the company\u2019s website within its Investor Relations section. During the call, non-GAAP financial measures may be used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. Tables reconciling these measures to most comparable GAAP measures are available in the company\u2019s press release issued earlier this morning on the Bio-Techne Corporation website at www.bio-techne.com. Separately, we will be participating in the BofA, RBC Capital Markets, Benchmark, Craig-Hallum and Jefferies Healthcare Conferences in May and June. We look forward to connecting with many of you at these upcoming conferences. I will now turn the call over to Chuck. Chuck Kummeth : Thank you for joining us for our third quarter conference call. As we expected, message in last quarter\u2019s call, our Q3 top-line year-on-year revenue growth was similar to the growth we reported in Q2. While the year-on-year growth rate and tough comps from last year were similar in both quarters, the underlying performance of the business improved quarter-on-quarter when considering the large ExoTRU kidney milestone payment received from Thermo Fisher last year in Q3. The team did a great job this quarter, furthering several of our key growth drivers as physician uptake and utilization of our ExoDx Prostate test accelerated demand for our cell therapy workflow solutions, including GMP proteins remains strong, and our spatial biology business returned to double-digit growth. These growth drivers were partially offset by the continued challenges of COVID in China, lower biotech funding and OEM destocking from supply chain disruption concerns last year. Encouragingly, as we look ahead to finishing this fiscal year and kicking off fiscal year 2024, we see China coming back strong. With COVID now in the rearview mirror, destocking by our OEM customers eventually with unwinding and moving beyond the tough prior year comps from our smaller biotech customers. Before I get into the specifics of the quarter, I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to welcome Peter Schuster as the new leader of our European organization and business. Peter has over 20 years of experience leading commercial organizations, including very relevant experience, successfully growing businesses and leading European-based teams in large life science tools companies. Under Peter\u2019s leadership, we are looking forward to continuing to grow our European presence and delivering the tools the region relies on to enable scientific discoveries. Now an overview of our performance by geography and end market. Starting with Europe, where the team delivered high single-digit growth \u2013 order growth in the quarter than the macro environment continued to stabilize and overall research activity increased sequentially within our core biopharma and academic end markets. Our new Dublin warehouse to support Mainland Europe is now fully functional and fulfilling customer orders. With a new leader in place, a new distribution center and an improved ERP system, we are positioned to serve our customers even better in the region. In North America, we also saw sequential improvement with order growth increasing mid-single digits in the quarter. Here, the impact of a lower biotech spend is the greatest and the year-on-year comp is the toughest with over 25% growth in biopharma last year. And finally, there is China, which was a tale of two chapters this quarter. Prior to the Lunar New Year, most people in China were still recovering from COVID and citizens were directed by the government who essentially stay home until after the New Year holiday. Up until this point in the quarter, sales were practically nonexistent in China. But after everyone \u2013 everyone was well and came back from holiday, sales accelerated dramatically, and our China team was able to finish the quarter with revenue growth in low single digits. This was on top of a comp where China grew with 30% last year, just through a remarkable effort by our team in China. With COVID now in the rearview mirror for China, we hope for good, we see China\u2019s growth continuing to accelerate from here, perhaps to more than 40% growth next quarter. Now let\u2019s discuss our growth platform, starting with our Protein Sciences segment, where organic revenue increased 5% for the quarter on top of a strong comp from last year when the segment grew 16%. During the quarter, we continued to make progress with our portfolio of cell therapy workflow solutions, including our GMP reagents, specialty cell culture media, along with cell culture matrices and DME, which collectively grew over 20% in our Q3. Our GMP proteins remain in high demand across cell therapy spectrum as biopharma customers developing products for the regenerative medicine and immune cell therapy markets continue to rely on our portfolio over 40 GMP-grade cytokines and growth factors, including several that are only available from Bio-Techne to effectively scale their therapies. Our GMP protein business had its second conceive record breaking quarter, and given our industry-leading menu of highly bioactive lot of lot consistent and peer GMP proteins, we are positioned to remain a leader in this rapidly growing market. In addition to the ongoing progress of expanding the GMP proteins venue, we are manufacturing in our state-of-the-art same fall facility. We are also experiencing significant yield improvements to scale production at this facility. Recall, we originally estimated GMP protein capacity at the facility was $140 million annually, which we increased to over $200 million as we manufactured initial protein batches from this new facility. As the team continues to launch additional GMP proteins, we have been able to achieve product yields as much as 50 times higher compared to legacy methods used to manufacture smaller batches in our headquarters. In fact, these productivity and yield gains have been so significant that we now estimate the capacity of this facility is at least $500 million and potentially higher than $1 billion, depending on the mix of GMP proteins ultimately manufactured from the facility. We also reached a significant milestone in our cell therapy strategy in Q3 with our initial investment in to Wilson Wolf. As a reminder, Wilson Wolf is a manufacturer of the proprietary line of cell production bioreactor called G-Rex, which provide an ideal amount of oxygen and nutrients to effectively scale immune cell therapies. Wilson Wolf and Fresenius Kabi have both have been key partners of our Bio-Techne through the ScaleReady commercial joint venture since 2020. With the three companies collectively offering tools and technologies for cell culture, cell activation, gene editing and cell processing, during the quarter, Wilson Wolf reached its trailing 12-month EBITDA milestone triggering Bio-Techne\u2019s $257 million investment for a 20% ownership stake into Wilson Wolf. We see tremendous synergies with the eventual ownership of Wilson Wolf and are already developing a one-of-a-kind standardized, closed cell and gene therapy manufacturing system that integrates G-Rex Bio-Techne\u2019s GMP proteins and T cell culture media into an FDA-compliant patient-ready off-the-shelf production process that will save end users significant time and money as they pursue meaningful clinical data and eventual commercialization of these novel cell therapies. Following this initial investment, Bio-Techne has the right to acquire the remainder of Wilson Wolf for $1 billion upon its achievement of additional milestones or for 4.4 times trailing 12-month revenue if these milestones are not achieved by December 31, 2027. We look forward to continuing near-term pipeline development work for Wilson Wolf and eventually having this rapidly growing, highly profitable industry standards under Bio-Techne growing umbrella of cell therapy product. Now let\u2019s discuss our portfolio proteomic research reagents, including our RUO proteins, antibodies and small molecules, which collectively grew single-digit low-single-digit in the quarter coming off of a challenging year-over-year comp, where we grew about 20% in Q3 of last year. I\u2019d like to elaborate on the OEM phenomenon we\u2019ve experienced in our year-over-year comps for the past couple of quarters. Recall that a year ago, supply chains were constrained and several companies, including Bio-Techne stocked up on certain components that are critical to meeting customer demand. Bio-Techne has an industry-leading catalog of over 6,000 proteins and over 425,000 different antibody types the researchers around the globe rely on as the basis of the research, enabling scientific discoveries, enabling new therapeutic and diagnostic discoveries to further health care. This same catalog of bioactive reagents also serves as the enabling content for several products from other diagnostic and life science tools companies. Without this content, a number of their assays will not work. Last fiscal year, a handful of these OEM customers stocked our reagents to ensure their ability to continue to meet demand for their products. Best we can tell right now, it will take another quarter or two before this destocking to unwind. After that, these headwinds should become tailwinds as these OEM customers run their normal ordering patterns of our reagents in fiscal 2024. Moving on to the performance of our ProteinSimple branded portfolio of analytical solutions \u2013 we delivered low double-digit growth in the quarter as all three of our primary instrument platforms increased in the quarter. The rapid installed base growth we experienced over the last two years continues to drive increased consumable utilization across our ProteinSimple instrument platform at our Simple Western, Simple Plex and Maurice instruments become more ingrained in research workflows. To ease \u2013 the ease of use and flexibility offered by our proteomic and analytical tools are leading to expanding applications across the three platforms. These expanding applications, particularly for cell and gene therapy, QA and QC is translating into higher total addressable market opportunities for these platforms as our legacy proteomic analytical tools TAM expands from $2 billion to $3 billion to firmly above $3 billion. Order funnels remain very strong across these three instant platforms, although budget conservatism from a subset of biotech end users has led to an overall lengthening of the order closing cycle. Our Simple Plex branded multiplexing immunoassay system, Ella, led instrument growth increasing by 25% in the quarter. The subpicogram sensitivity and cost advantages offered by this fully automated ELISA platform combined with an expanding menu of over 250 analytes to support therapeutic areas across neuroscience, cell and gene therapy, immunology and cancer continues to resonate with both biopharma and academic customers. This traction and acceptance in both industry and academia is apparent to the growing number of instruments in the field as Ella cross an important milestone in the quarter with over 1,000 instruments now in the field. In neuroscience, Ella\u2019s high level of sensitivity positions it as an ideal intent for biomarker detection and discovery making us the prime area for future menu expansion. We also continue to make progress comparing Ella to penetrate the clinical diagnostic market as our ISO 1345 audit of our Wallingford facility continues to progress. With a growing installed base, a rapidly expanding menu and an untapped clinical diagnostic market opportunity, we continue to see incredibly bright future for Ella. Now let\u2019s discuss our biologics platform, Maurice, which enables protein purity, charge and identity analysis in five minutes in an easy-to-use cartridge-based instruments. Recall that we recently expanded on Maurice\u2019s capabilities with the launch of Maurice Flex, which adds image capillary isoelectric focusing fractionization capabilities to the instrument. Fractionation is a front-end step in mastectomy and Maurice select addresses the labor intensive and time consuming the challenges of using legacy fractionation, methods, including Ion exchange chromatography. This new application enters Maurice into a new $300 million market. Initial biopharma interest in Maurice Flex has been strong, and we had multiple initial instrument placements in the quarter. Our Simple Western platform continues to penetrate the Western blot market as its ability to automate the time-consuming and cumbersome Simple Western blot process with a sample in answered \u2013 solution resonates within our biopharma and academic research end markets. Similar to our other platforms, applications for Simple Western are expanding, including quantitative immunoassays for both cell signaling and rare protein detection in complex lysates and rare tissues. Additionally, our biopharma customers are increasingly relying on Simple Western in their gene therapy workflows, as its ability to detect protein-related impurities viral titer and identity information and empty versus full capsid information provide critical QA/QC information for these workflows. Gene therapy remains a nascent but rapidly growing application for Simple Western, and we experienced 30% growth in necessary during Q3. We also partnered with Cell Signalling Technology, or CST, to expand the number of Simple Western validated antibodies for various targets and across multiple disciplines. CST is a leader in the development of antibodies and other related western blotting reagents used to elucidate Cell Signalling pathways that dictates cellular behavior and impact human health. We are excited about the addition of these new antibodies to the Bio-Techne catalog of validated antibodies and are encouraged with the market response following the announcement. Now let\u2019s shift to our Diagnostics and Genomics segment, where organic revenue declined by 2%. Adjusting for the ex vitro milestone payment from Thermal Fisher Scientific that we received in the comparable quarter last year, but did not repeat in the current quarter segment growth was upper single digits. Starting with our molecular diagnostics business, where we continue to experience increased physician adoption and utilization of our ExoDx prostate test leading to over 70% test volume growth for the fifth consecutive quarter and associated revenue increase of 85% in the quarter. We continue to see positive momentum on the key performance indicators we track for ExoDx prostate test, including year-over-year and sequential growth in a number of physicians ordering the test record test volume from physicians new to the ExoDx prostate as well as a record number of doctors ordering more than 25 tests in a quarter. We are pairing this volume momentum with continued progress in strengthening our coverage with private payers, as our recently bolstered market access group continues to improve access to the large national payers, positioning ExoDx prostate for expanded future coverage. The team is doing an excellent job managing a rapid growth in ExoDX prostate test volume and we continue to experience record volumes in our Q4 to date. During the quarter, an expanded local coverage determination from National Government Services, who is our Medicare administrative contractor, covering our Massachusetts based Exosome Diagnostics; CLIA-certified laboratory went into effect. This updated policy now covers the ExoDx Prostate test for men with a prior negative biopsy but who are thought to be at high risk for prostate cancer and are considering a repeat biopsy. Following this update, the LCD now mirrors the National Comprehensive Cancer Network or NCCN guidelines and enables reimbursement for ExoDx Prostate is a monitoring tool in populations with and without a prior prostate biopsy, effectively increasing the total addressable market opportunity by approximately 50% for the test. Our spatial biology business, branded ACD, increased low double digits in the quarter with adoption in our flagship RNA scope assay remains strong. This gold standard RNA in situ hybridization assay enables industry-leading sensitivity and specificity transcriptome analysis while retaining tissue morphology. We furthered this industry-leading capability with the recent introduction of our new exceptionally bright Vivid Fluorophore, enabling customers to easily detect and visualize both abundant RNAs as well as RNAs of very low abundant in a tissue sample. More recent additions to the ACD portfolio are also gaining traction, including BaseScope and micro and RNA scope. As these novel solutions enable visualization and evaluation of therapeutic biodistribution, safety and efficacy of gene therapy delivery vectors and oligonucleotide therapies. BaseScope and MicroRNA scope are both relatively small contributors to our spatial biology business today but are growing rapidly and becoming progressively more accretive to the growth of this business. Continuing with spatial biology, we recently announced an important strategic partnership with Lunaphore for who developed the first fully automated spatial multiomic workflow with same slide HyperFlex detection of protein and RNA biomarkers on Lunaphore\u2019s COMET instrument. This solution will enable users to easily visualize both cell type and their activation space in tissue. Combining COMET\u2019s highly flexible custom antibody panel design with RNAscope\u2019s library of 45,000 catalog probes and our in-house custom probe design capabilities will give customers the ultimate flexibility in achieving their study goals. In summary, our Q3 performance was in line with our expectations. As China growth snapped back and the temporary headwinds created by reagent destocking from a handful of OEM partners subside, we believe we are well positioned to accelerate growth next quarter and beyond. One thing is certain, our portfolio of cell and gene therapy workflow solutions, a best-in-class liquid biopsy platform novel proteomic analytical tools, spatial biology capabilities, all coupled with an industry-leading catalog of bioactive content positions Bio-Techne to remain a leader in some of the most rapidly growing life science tools market. We look forward to continuing to execute our strategic growth plan and deliver on the vast opportunity in front of us. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jim. Jim Hippel : Thanks, Chuck. Let\u2019s start with recapping the overall third quarter financial performance. Adjusted EPS was $0.53, consistent with the prior year quarter. Foreign exchange negatively impacted EPS by $0.01 or minus 2% in the quarter. GAAP EPS in Q3 was $0.43 compared to $0.37 in the prior year. The biggest driver for the increase in GAAP EPS was a nonrecurring loss on our previously held ChemoCentryx investment in the prior year period. Q3 revenue was $294.1 million, an increase of 3% year-over-year on an organic basis and 1% on a reported basis. Foreign exchange translation had an unfavorable impact of 2% and acquisitions had an immaterial impact on revenue growth. Chuck has called out the temporary headwinds we faced in Q3, and I will quantify their impact to overall company growth. Starting with prior year\u2019s ExoTRU milestone payment. The impact of this onetime revenue recognition last year in Q3 was approximately a 3.5% headwind to our overall growth this year. The COVID infections and corresponding shutdowns in China this quarter was an additional headwind to overall company growth of approximately 2.5%. The OEM destocking of REO reagents, we estimate to be another 1.5% headwind to our overall company growth rate. The accumulation of these specific and temporary headwinds is approximately 7.5%, which and added back to our reported organic growth brings us to an adjusted organic growth rate of over 10%. The normalization of smaller biotech customer spend following a red-hot funding environment the past couple of years is more difficult to quantify, but it is also a headwind that may take more time to work through. The biotech research is not going away. It is often the important innovative bridge between epidemic discovery and big pharma therapy commercialization. In the meantime, Bio-Techne will continue to serve all these customers in the life science change that ultimately brings quality of life to patients with innovative products that improves their likelihood of success and the most productive way possible. The double-digit growth we see in our key growth platform cell and gene therapy, Exosome Diagnostics, spatial biology and ProteinSimple branded automated assays demonstrate this is already the case. Moving on to our organic growth by region and end market in Q3. North America grew mid-single digits. Europe demand increased upper single digits. China grew low-single digits, while APAC declined low-single digits due to prior year government stimulus in Japan not repeating this year. By end market, biopharma grew high single digits, while academia grew mid-single digits. Both were partially offset by the impact of destocking by a handful of OEM customers. Further down the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin was 72.6% in the quarter compared to 73.2% in the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by unfavorable foreign exchange and product mix. Adjusted SG&A in Q3 was 27.9% of revenue compared to 26.1% in the prior year while R&D expense in Q3 was 7.7% of revenue compared to 7.5% in the prior year. The increase in SG&A and R&D was driven by strategic growth investments made in Q4 of fiscal year 2022 and the acquisition of Namocell. The business has implemented strategic price increases during the first half of fiscal year 2023 to offset the dollar impact of inflation to operating income, with pricing largely offsetting the inflation impact on our operating margin as well in Q3. Adjusted operating margin for Q3 was 37%, a decrease of 260 basis points from the prior year, but a 150 basis point improvement sequentially. The impact of the nonrecurring ExoTRU milestone payment in the prior year period decreased margin by 130 basis points. Foreign exchange decreased adjusted operating margin by another 50 basis points, while the acquisition of Namocell and other strategic growth investments drove the remainder of the margin dilution for the quarter. As our top-line headwinds start to subside, we will continue to make strategic investments in our key growth platforms to ensure their long-term momentum. By doing so, we expect operating margins in Q4 to be comparable to Q3. Looking at our numbers below operating income. Net interest expense in Q3 was $0.2 million, decreasing $2 million compared to the prior year period due to lower debt levels and higher interest income earned on cash deposits. Our bank debt on the balance sheet as of the end of Q2 stood at $370 million, an increase of $170 million compared to last quarter, with the increase reflecting our investment in Wilson Wolf, which was funded partially with debt and cash on hand. I would note, given the timing of the Wilson Wolf investment, which took place at the very end of our fiscal Q3, we anticipate our net interest expense to increase sequentially to approximately $2.7 million in Q4. Other adjusted non-operating income was $0.1 million in the quarter, an increase of $1.2 million compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting the foreign exchange impact related to our cash point arrangement. Moving further down the P&L, our adjusted effective tax rate in Q3 was 21%. Turning to cash flow and return of capital, $50.5 million of cash was generated from operations in the quarter, and our net investment in capital expenditures was $11.7 million. Also during Q3, we returned capital to shareholders by way of $12.6 million dividend, and we finished the quarter with $161.6 million average diluted shares outstanding. Our balance sheet finished Q3 in a strong position with $157.2 million in cash and short-term available for sale investments. And our total leverage ratio remains below one turn. And going forward, M&A remains a top priority for capital allocation. Next, I\u2019ll discuss the performance of our reporting segments, starting with the Protein Sciences segment. Q3 reported sales were $218.9 million with reported revenue increasing 3% compared to the same period last year. Organic growth for this segment was 5%, with foreign exchange having an unfavorable impact of 2%. Despite the temporary headwinds and the tough year-over-year comp, I will highlight that the longer-term fighter CAGR for this segment is approximately 12% [ph]. Operating margin for the Protein Sciences segment was 45.1%, a decrease of 30 basis points year-over-year with operational productivity is more than offset by foreign exchange and the impact of the Namocell acquisition. Turning to the Diagnostics and Genomics segment. Q3 reported sales were $75.7 million, with reported revenue decreasing 3%. Organic revenue decreased 2% with foreign exchange having an unfavorable 1% impact. As Chuck mentioned earlier, adjusting for the ExoTRU milestone payment we received in Q3 of last year, which did not repeat again this year, organic growth was upper single digits for the segment. Our Exosome Diagnostics business remained incredibly strong in the quarter as our fortified marketing message, strengthened commercial team and the recently updated Medicare LCD drove record test volume and revenue growth. Our spatial biology business returned to double-digit growth in the quarter with strong performances in our RNAscope, BaseScope, and microRNA product line, partially offset by relative softness from a few biotech customers. Moving on to Diagnostics and Genomics segment operating margin at 15.2%, the segment\u2019s operating margin decreased 980 basis points compared to the prior year. The segment\u2019s operating margin was unfavorably impacted primarily by prior year revenue related to the ExoTRU milestone payment and, to a lesser extent, net inflation and strategic growth investments. Before we get to Q&A, we would summarize our fiscal year up to this point, our most recently completed quarter and our view looking forward as follows : For much of the first half of our fiscal year, our customers were going to behave in a post-COVID pandemic world was rather murky. This included behaviors such as customers taking pent-up vacations last summer and fall, a more risk-off mentality for smaller biotech investing, government-induced shutdowns in our highest growth region in China, and a realization of the stocking that took place during the COVID-induced supply chain crunch that is now unwinding. These behavioral outcomes became clearer as we exited Q2 and gave us more visibility going forward. Through it all, and as Q3 demonstrated, our growth platforms are still winning with double-digit growth. As we enter Q4, some of the headwinds should diminish, especially in China, but some are likely to remain, namely the OEM destocking and smaller biotech rationalize spending. Looking further ahead into fiscal year 2024, these remaining headwinds should further diminish a double-digit revenue increases we see in our strategic growth platforms to once again be reflected in our headline numbers. In the meantime, we expect Q4 overall momentum to continue to improve from Q2 and Q3 with an overall growth rate likely similar to how we started the fiscal year in Q1. That concludes my prepared comments. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over the operator to open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Puneet Souda of SVB Securities. Please proceed with your question. Puneet Souda : Hi Chuck, Jim, thanks for the question. So first one on biotech funding, obviously, there have been quite a bit of noise out there from bioprocessing. You highlighted a number of things and trends that you\u2019re seeing as well as the headwinds \u2013 but if the headwinds were to prolong, where do you think the business is more defensible and where you think where the pressures could be felt more? And then I think what Jim was implying at the first quarter is about 7% growth that you delivered. So, I assume that\u2019s what you\u2019re expecting for the fourth quarter. What does this mean for \u2013 could you get back to sort of the mid-teens levels as we head into the sort of the first and the second quarter of 2024? Would really appreciate sort of a color on that because I think that\u2019s sort of the key question given these biotech questions and emerging biotech headwind. Chuck Kummeth : Sure, Puneet. Thanks. Well, I think first and foremost, I think we\u2019re kind of talking about come back a little more quickly than others are talking about it. We bridge for you the destocking component. And a lot of these stock, and we know the customers, and we know what they\u2019re at, and they\u2019ve been very clear with us. So we know when they\u2019re coming back or more, and it really is in Q1. So there will still be funding pressures for sure. I mean the public information out there on amount of biotech funding reductions are double digit and beyond so it is impactful. But we\u2019re kind of certain and lot of that with surgical work here within our own OEM sector, which was coming back.. Let\u2019s not forget that we were in the mid-teens in our run rate is a supporting biopharma end-to-end academic last quarter. This quarter, we were a low teens still in our run rate business, so for our consumables. So that\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s all speaks very positive current department going forward. We just think it starts getting better. I mean, as you pointed out, we got one more tough quarter, a really tough Q4 comp. We had a blowout last couple of weeks last year Q4, kind of which that would have been in Q1 now. And you\u2019re right in that seven high single-digit number is kind of our range. China is a big factor too. I mean we\u2019ve got \u2013 we see China is going back. We were just over there. First time in three and a half years. The team is in great spirit, full spring, being all their customers and things are ramping extremely fast. So, I wasn\u2019t kidding with 40% or better. That should be kind of in the range for us for China. And that gives us a good base across the company to start building on an overall growth rate. Puneet Souda : And Jim, in terms of recovery back to sort of mid-teens, I just want to clarify, you meant fourth quarter should be in line with first quarter or for the full year? Jim Hippel : In line with the first quarter. Puneet Souda : Okay. And then just if I could ask a little bit on the closed loop system that you highlighted, what\u2019s the time line on that? What\u2019s the sort of investment needed there? And sort of how it differentiates from the rest of the platforms to the market, Cocoon and other ones, and do you have enough pieces already in terms of the consumables product to sort of fulfill the entire closed loop system there? Chuck Kummeth : Yes. So we actually made great progress there. As you know, we\u2019ve got a factory that we\u2019re pushing the co-brand in the every month. We have the G-Rex platform, which is already in the standard out there. The last real miss integration of media, we have a couple of different formulations of media that we\u2019re going out with. We\u2019ve been in media forever, but in more regenerative medicine type approaches this is a little more different. So we\u2019re looking at kind of the make versus buy, how to cut it. It\u2019s all about time and scale. So we think within a year here, we are with a cool system. So roughly about a year, and it\u2019s probably a little much right now, it could be sooner. It could be a later sense of how much we want to go it ourselves with our own capital and assets or those partnering. Puneet Souda : Okay. Great. Chuck Kummeth : We have IT and we have solutions for how to actually integrate it within G-Rex already. So some real novel solutions that some of them John Wilson itself has been involved in. Puneet Souda : Got it. Okay, all right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jacob Johnson from Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Jacob Johnson : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Chuck, maybe following up on that last question. Just now that you own 20% of Wilson Wolf, does this change anything about that relationship? Does it allow for kind of more collaboration between the two of you? Does it create additional opportunities? Just curious if anything changes from that standpoint. Chuck Kummeth : Well, it\u2019s a great question. We have a great relationship. We talk every week. The teams are being put together. As I pointed out, one of the key thing was the fact that you want us to take over and do more operations as he\u2019s exploding in growth, he kind of is more of a KOL, I\u2019ll say with all the docs and peracetic and the institutions that\u2019s where you want to more or less live. As, we just put out a big press release last week here of CellReady, so he is building a new company, a CDMO type model, working with assets for marker to trying and build all that more quickly and get your customers more quickly, save a lot of time, a lot of money with start-ups and with professors with their cell ideas, et cetera. And guess what the workflow is it\u2019s going to drive that whole mechanism. It\u2019s scale; it\u2019s our ScaleReady JV workflow. That means our protein, G-Rex of course, use the [indiscernible] hardware as well and work we\u2019ll use all our incidents for Q3. We\u2019ll have our media, we\u2019ll have \u2013 or workflow will come in. So that makes us tighter even yes because he wants to make sure that we\u2019re integrating for the future, too, as we build out these new ideas because he\u2019s already kind of understanding that we\u2019re at 20%. This deal is going to happen. So, we\u2019re starting to really focused on what else can go and wrap around the Wilson Wolf franchise to make it even bigger and better, which is all good for us together long term. So if anything, we\u2019re talking more and we have more ideas to the future together to build the next multibillion-dollar venture. Jacob Johnson : Got it. Thanks for that Chuck. And maybe just stick on the cell and gene therapy front. I think there\u2019s been kind of a bearing commentary about that end market, but it sounded like you had a pretty good quarter there on the GMP protein side. Can you just talk about how much of that is new customer wins? Any of these customers kind of scaling up? And maybe if you could kind of remind us where that customer base stands in the clinical trial process right now? Chuck Kummeth : Yes, we had a 45% quarter, and I thought of another strong comp last year, 21% or 22% overall for the category. So really strong \u2013 it\u2019s still growing. It\u2019s becoming close to material by next year for sure. And I think overall, we just keep accelerating. I think we\u2019re roughly around 200 customers now, and the large ones about I\u2019ve got a couple more, I\u2019d say, larger, they\u2019re all kind of scaling a little more. We\u2019re trying to keep filling the funnel and it\u2019s about turning these minerals into tuna and then into whales, right? So in a couple of years, we hope to have a couple of dozen whales and it won\u2019t take many to really get this factory norm [ph] and so they\u2019re coming. Jacob Johnson : Perfect. I leave it there. Thanks, Chuck. Operator : Our next question comes from Dan Arias with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Dan Arias : Good morning guys. Thanks for the question. Chuck, maybe on ACD, what\u2019s the growth outlook there? And how has that evolved as we digest the biotech spending environment \u2013 and then in spatial overall, you\u2019ve now got these two partnerships here with Akoya and Lunaphore. What, if anything, does the incremental revenue contribution potential look like for you guys on those? Chuck Kummeth : Yes. Well, we\u2019re thrilled that it\u2019s come back to double digits. It should stay there. We\u2019ll see. There\u2019s a lot of opportunity. And you realize also this is not a category that\u2019s like only biotech or only pharma. There\u2019s a lot of academia with that franchise. So \u2013 and our academia has been kind of mid-single-digit area. So it\u2019s one of our hurdle to get over, its keep raising actually being hit. We also have a service component with that business. And that\u2019s been up and down. And it was better this quarter. We got to make sure we keep pounding away on that service. That service element is how we find a lot of new customers. We will start with a service contract, and then we blow them away with the data, making then they come on board and they start ordering probes and go from there. So it all works together. Akoya is very different than the Lunaphore model. The Lunaphore model, that program is for co-detection protein and RNA together on a single slide, still single morphology whereas the Akoya is all RNA only. So they\u2019re a little bit different. We\u2019ve been pretty clear about being a bit foot from a high level than Ventana, Leica all the way down to the lower automation with these guys. And we even play with NanoString and others in the middle trying to support them. The more they do in discovery, the more roll our way in translational later. So it\u2019s all good. I just came from the ALDA conference and the theme was spatial and it was a record turnout by about 40% more people, spatial is hot. And there\u2019s more common. There\u2019s a lot more innovation. There\u2019s more companies coming, there\u2019s more ideas. And we\u2019re thrilled to one of the leaders, and we\u2019re working with all the leaders in hardware and automation. And as, we\u2019ve got some multiplexing capability coming and now with co-detection as well that, that\u2019s going to be \u2013 it\u2019s going to fill a big gap out there for what people are looking for identifying what they\u2019re really after in their tissues. Dan Arias : Okay. Do you have a view on just long-term growth there and what you might end up looking like as we head towards the longer-term targets because that is one of the businesses that I think is sort of the kind of like a wildcard in terms of whether or not $2 billion or something below that as a reasonable target going forward? Chuck Kummeth : Yes. You should know it, $100 million kind of run rate business right now. We\u2019ve always talked about it being a $300 million-plus business, but that\u2019s with discovery, but also with pathology. Having Lunaphore and having other relationships allows us to really give pathologists more what they\u2019re looking for. So they\u2019re not working on a single slide under a scope with one analyze at a time here is difficult. And let\u2019s not forget, we\u2019ve launched a whole set of new dye fluorescence, fluorophores. We call Vivid, and they are really lighting up the slides, and they\u2019re getting a lot of great acceptance as well. You start adding where we\u2019re going with translational riding the heels of all the discovery guys and with these new players helping us automation-wise, getting into pathology, five years to 10 years out, this is well beyond $300 million. This is a double-digit growth rate needs to be, got to be when it isn\u2019t. We make changes here. It\u2019s been as high as 30-plus percent on some quarters and \u2013 and we hope to be in double digits going forward. So it\u2019s \u2013 there\u2019s academic. There\u2019s funding issues this year. It\u2019s been a little bit lumpy. We\u2019re double digits this quarter. I think it looks pretty solid. We\u2019re excited about the relationship. I think we\u2019re quite a few months away here yet I\u2019m actually having revenue on a platform like that, but it\u2019s all coming, so. Dan Arias : Okay. Just a follow-up for me, if I could. Chuck, I have to admit that I was listening to you welcome Peter in Europe. It occurs to me that we\u2019re pushing towards June here were unfortunately coming up on you being a year away from moving on to the next endeavor. The speculation on the Street is that you\u2019re starting a band. I don\u2019t know if you want to comment on that. But if not, can you just maybe update us on what, if anything, a conversation at the Board level sounds like in terms of just an executive search internal versus external candidates, timing on announcement, that sort of saying anything for us to think about there? Chuck Kummeth : Yes. It\u2019s still 14 months away, if you\u2019re stuck with me for three or four more quarters, and I will not be joining a band. We\u2019ve not heard me saying [ph]. But \u2013 there is \u2013 obviously, I\u2019ve done my job with grooming, I think three excellent internal candidates. All could carry the water here for quite a while, I think. The Board is looking outside as well. We have a fiduciary responsibility. And the fundamental reason of taking the time and looking broad is that we\u2019re \u2013 under my watch for 10 years, we\u2019ve, I guess we\u2019ve increased the sales here 400% or 500% something like that in the next 10 years, we want another 400%, 500%. We\u2019re up 6x, 7x, 8x in valuation in 10 years and another 10 years, if you want to be up another five times, six times, seven times, eight times in valuation. That puts us at needing somebody to run a $60 billion market cap company at $5 billion, $6 billion in revenue. That\u2019s the goal. That\u2019s the plan, and that\u2019s where we\u2019re operating for. And I will remain on the Board hopefully. Board willing, so I\u2019m not totally missing so. Operator : Our next question comes from Dan Leonard from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Dan Leonard : Hi, good morning. Thank you for the time. Chuck, can you elaborate further on the visibility you have into the OEM destocking dynamic? Chuck Kummeth : Well, I hope we did pretty good job bridging it. It\u2019s about 1.5%. It would\u2019ve been the best thing about this destocking OEM component. We\u2019re not talking about across the board problem. We\u2019re talking about half a dozen or so different customers that are all in the millions of dollars of purchases last year and this year are at zero. And they won\u2019t remain at zero. Some won\u2019t come back, a lot are going to come back hard and heavy, and then we\u2019re really building the funnel with new ones. The beautiful thing about biotech is every year, there\u2019s a whole new play the new people ideas that want to buy new juice some leaders like us to try things up. So \u2013 it\u2019s building, it\u2019s coming back, it\u2019s identifiable. And I guess if there\u2019s more numbers, I\u2019ll let Jim comment. But I think 1.5% is pretty clear, so. Dan Leonard : And then a follow-up question for Jim. I want to make sure I understood your summary comments appropriately. Did you say that Bio-Techne would return to double-digit growth in fiscal 2024? Jim Hippel : Well, we\u2019re in the process of building our plan right now for next year, right? What I was trying to indicate in my closing remarks was that if you take out the very isolated events OEM destocking. China, as an example, the ExoTRU deal and the rest of our business collectively is at double digits already. And our key growth programs, which are going to carry us to $2 billion and beyond are also all growing well in the double digits. And so it suggests that we get past these headwinds in fiscal year 2023, during fiscal year 2024, this underlying double-digit growth was seen not only in our core but definitely in our growth programs, growth platforms we\u2019ll start to once again resonate and you\u2019ll see it in the overall company results. And that\u2019s our goal. Chuck Kummeth : Let me put a little ribbon on that. So, I mentioned our run rate \u2013 we watch our run rate and how we\u2019re doing digitally with our catalogs. We are funded first and foremost, the catalog business for life sciences across the board, biopharma down through academia. And that\u2019s remaining in teen tells us that things are okay. Then you look for other holes and we bridge it for you. This OEM thing is going to come and go, you pull that back, we\u2019re back to normality. And on top of that, you have these growth programs. Our three top growth areas all hedged spectacular quarters. Spatial had double-digit, 45% GMP protein, 20%-plus in cell and gene therapy overall and Exosome at 87%. They\u2019re not material enough right now to carry the average. But by next year, there are going to be a lot more material and they\u2019re going to carry the average. So all the stuff fundamental coming back on top of these growth programs, we don\u2019t give guidance, but we won\u2019t be very happy here if we\u2019re not a double-digit growth and so. Operator : Our next question comes from Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Patrick Donnelly : Hey guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Chuck, maybe dive a little deeper on China. I guess encouraging to hear that 40% number thrown around for this quarter. Can you just talk a little bit about the trends you saw maybe in March and then into April, it\u2019s not only a really nice recovery post the Lunar New Year. And then what \u2013 how do you kind of think about the go forward there? Looking back to maybe the last time this happened with the COVID lockdown, is there this big pent-up demand and it\u2019s one quarter of really good growth? Or do you see real durability as we work our way into fiscal 2024 here, where it should be a nice stretch in China. Chuck Kummeth : Yes, we are just there, and that was absolutely one of the questions. It\u2019s almost per word, when we asked the team in our reviews there. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re seeing the extreme kickback we come off that COVID quarter, roughly three years ago now. It\u2019s just coming back strong and hard \u2013 now again, this is an easy comp from last year for China. And \u2013 but this last quarter, two months of the quarter, nobody was at work, like zero. We had 90%-plus people stick with COVID. So we had a very strong market because they all came back and there was pent-up demand. People want to get back to work and restart. We\u2019re a run rate business. So people aren\u2019t at working their labs, they\u2019re not running experiments, not running experience. They\u2019re not using our juice. So now they\u2019re all back, and they want more and they\u2019re hungry and they\u2019re trying to catch up. So some level of that we saw a few years ago will happen. But I think it\u2019s more steady. It\u2019s more steady too, because the instant component of that. It\u2019s also coming back and resurging well. We see really good strong growth going forward. We weren\u2019t \u2013 one reason we did have some growth as a lot of it is an instrument side effect there, and that\u2019s obviously a longer sales cycle. But that\u2019s one of our business regions where we have stronger percentage of the portfolio is an instrument and we see that continuing. So going forward, we\u2019re 200-plus people strong there. The leader, Lee Hyun [ph] work with us that worked with me in Thermo Fisher. He is solid. We\u2019ve got many years left to go, it\u2019s a well-respected industry. He\u2019s built businesses in this past that are five times, 10 times bigger than this is still right now. So we\u2019ve got a long way to go. The salespeople are great, our leader in instruments. It\u2019s still the original leader that came with ProteinSimple, way back when and is more energetic and engaged than ever. And we love this guy. He knows the markets. He knows every customer. The relationships are fantastic. He\u2019s been able to build a big team under him from when he was in a smaller company. So it\u2019s all looking pretty good. We also had a very large reception. We got to pretty neat and talk to like literally most of the folks there. We weren\u2019t there many days. We want to really maximize our timing and get to know everybody again. China an area, you want to get there and touch them once every year, if you can. Three years, it\u2019s too long not to be there. Businesses can drift. And in places like China, they can drift maybe you can find surprises. We didn\u2019t find any surprises. The morale of this team has been fantastic. The engagement has been good. A lot of new people, but only about 25% in the last couple of years are new there. I always asked that. I have asked for a show of hands, who\u2019s in the last year and who\u2019s before that. So attrition has been very good and we\u2019re just holding for done. And end of the day, it\u2019s a $100 million business, 10% a little more, a little less of our company back to growing 20%-plus next year, we think, is a no-brainer. We won\u2019t stay at 40%-plus this quarters anomaly, but next year, we\u2019re going to probably work with them on a plan at 20%-plus for sure. That\u2019s no reason why not. And maybe more. We\u2019ll get back to you as we get a plan, so. Patrick Donnelly : Okay. That sounds good. And then, Jim, maybe on the margins, I think you kind of framed up 4Q looking similar to 3Q. As we work our way into 2024, is that kind of the right number to think about building off of? And can you just remind us any moving pieces that work our way into next year. Obviously, some of the headwinds hit margins as well as we work our way, hopefully back to that double-digit growth number you Chuck talked about, should be some nice leverage in the model, but maybe just frame up the margin piece exiting out of 4Q here. Jim Hippel : Yes. Again, I\u2019ll be able to provide more clarity, excuse me, I\u2019ll be able to provide more clarity on our margin and margin profile for next year as we get through our plan in our next earnings call. But I guess at a high level, I would say, I would expect \u2013 if you look at our margin profile historically, it tends to dip in Q1 and then gradually increase throughout the rest of the year just due to seasonality Q1 is typically a lower revenue quarter for us and the cost base is easily higher coming off of Q4 fiscal year to the prior year. So \u2013 in terms of that 37 increasing sequentially into Q1, I would say probably not. But if you look at the full year of where we finished fiscal year 2023, looking ahead to fiscal year 2024, at this point in time, I don\u2019t see any material headwinds to margin as to why we wouldn\u2019t at least expect some incremental margin improvement year-over-year for the year. Operator : Our next question comes from Catherine Schulte with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Catherine Schulte : Hey guys. Thanks for the questions. I ask first on Exosome sounds like you seeing impressive uptake on your ExoDx prostate test. Any comments you can give just on the path to profitability or margin profile for that business? Chuck Kummeth : Sure. Well, as we\u2019ve taken on. I wouldn\u2019t say conservative, but a careful approach to their expansion and growth. We\u2019ve had a dilution level that we\u2019ve been able to live with the last four years or five years, whatever it\u2019s been now. And I would say that dilution level is down by 30%, 40% when it was because we\u2019re investing. We\u2019re at full strength or near to it, so we\u2019ve almost doubled that sales force. We\u2019ve added a new team for the experienced team to really go after five of the larger private payers. We had to get big enough to attract the right players and people and talent to do this. But I would say the size of the business is up headcount-wise, roughly 30%, 40%, maybe even a little more from a year or two ago. And \u2013 and we talked about we\u2019re at the breakeven point. And we talked in past to finding some records that what we called it. We bought it thinking to be $30 million in revenue and then found off to top value being more like $60 million or $70 million of revenue to be a breakeven point. This team and under Lynn think it\u2019s much better than that. So we got another year or so, 1.5 years. I think we\u2019re adding to a breakeven point of profitability. And then maybe we will or maybe we won\u2019t. We will decide to invest harder and stay at the levels we\u2019re at dilution levels we\u2019re at. I mean that thing we\u2019ll put ads on TV for the prostate test yet. But I think this team is starting to accelerate even more. And we\u2019re \u2013 we hit 11,000 tests last quarters, which is pretty remarkable. As you know, we\u2019ve got the full into the guidelines now into our reimbursement equation. That means we can go back after patients that had their first test done or had a biopsy and have it again and use this for surveillance \u2013 in the entire period before last quarter, I think we had 15 tests done, that were a repeat. In the last quarter, we had over 240. So we\u2019re going back after the surveillance patients, which is an added \u2013 which really is an added TAM, right? So that\u2019s one thing you\u2019re seeing, I think the growth even accelerate. And I don\u2019t even think we get a tipping point yet. I tell the team, I\u2019m looking for something north of 100% growth. And I think that day will come, so. Catherine Schulte : All right. Great. And then can you quantify what you expect the OEM destocking headwind to be in the fourth quarter? I guess the adjusted third quarter growth was 10%, and then you have in fourth quarter; China is turning into a tailwind. Why shouldn\u2019t organic growth be a little bit better than that 7% number you talked about even if you see similar levels of destocking. Jim Hippel : So I would say that. This is Jim I\u2019d say, the OEM headwind is almost exactly the same for Q4 as it is for Q3 that\u2019s what we\u2019re predicting as of right now. As are the general biotech softness headwinds still are with us until we get past the last year, very tough comps. As Chuck pointed out, the comp for Protein Sciences was the same in Q4 as there was in Q3 last year. So they\u2019re book equally difficult comp. And yes \u2013 and so yes, China will be better. You won\u2019t have the ExoTRU, but at the end of the day, I think the overall headwinds facing Protein Sciences segment are the same in Q4 as they were in Q3 and with the exception of China. But \u2013 and we expect Diagnostics and Genomics to be better because they don\u2019t have the ExoTRU in it next year. But again, it\u2019s only in total about 25% of our business. So the incremental China and the lack of ExoTRU is what, gets to the overall company growth rate from, call it, 3% to hopefully north of 7%. Operator : Our next question comes from Justin Bowers with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Justin Bowers : Hey, good morning. Just want to follow-up on some of the last couple of questions. One, on the OEM, is that headwind that you\u2019re talking about in the back half? Is that \u2013 is that sort of like the full year headwind as well? And then just taking a step back, if we go to pre-COVID, is the business in the sales cycle to that similar to the run rate business? Or is there some seasonality and lumpiness to that business? Chuck Kummeth : In what area? Justin Bowers : Sorry, for the OEM channel. Chuck Kummeth : For the OEM. Well, I think COVID has, had effect on everything OEM, I think it\u2019s effective environment. It\u2019s affecting funding and expecting conservatism and all the above. So people have been stocking and we\u2019ve been careful through the supply chain risk environment we were in last year. You called the back half will be the front half of our next fiscal year. We see improving first starting in Q1. Others have been online here recently saying it\u2019s an all year event. I don\u2019t know their business as well as I know are. So I think we\u2019ve got some large OEMs that are running out of stuff. And they\u2019re not insolvent. They\u2019ve just been \u2013 they\u2019re conservative and they\u2019ve stocked up. We have a few that are new coming and growing and we have a few that are shrinking and going away, it\u2019s being bought or whatever. So I think the net-net at all, we see an improving OEM first half of our fiscal year. From what we know right now, we\u2019re just being transparent on what we see right now. The next quarter, maybe it will all change. I don\u2019t know if maybe something else will happen, but that\u2019s what we see right now. And we\u2019re pushing on these customers to start buying again, so. Jim Hippel : I mean obviously at some point, they start to run out of inventory. So we\u2019re trying to model that again when we think that will happen, and we do think at some point in the first half of fiscal 2024, along with their sales continue \u2013 as long as they continue to have sales they\u2019re going to need to restock and for more inventory. Chuck Kummeth : Don\u2019t forget that. We\u2019re not happy with a handful of large customers. We\u2019ve got hundreds of customers. We want a 100 large. Operator : Our next question comes from Alex Nowak with Craig-Hallum. Please proceed with your question. Alex Nowak : Okay, great. Good morning everyone. So I was just curious if there\u2019s any product lines out there that are just not working in the portfolio? Because to a prior question and in the prepared remarks, you talked about cell and gene therapy, GMP protein \u2013 spatial, Exosome all these being very massively in the quarter, but just not enough to drive the average. So I\u2019m just trying to understand, is there a product line that is just struggling from competition and change in mature demand by your customers? Or it\u2019s really the only thing that\u2019s going is really just macro China, macro OEM destocking. Chuck Kummeth : It\u2019s mostly macro, but I\u2019d say we\u2019ve not been happy with academia to last year. It\u2019s more or less low to mid-single digits. Europe is up and down a little bit, but China was like a big zero practically. So that\u2019s a big impact. APAC wasn\u2019t strong either. So that this quarter, which is timing and then missing stimulus in Korea and Japan. So those things kind of weigh into that. When you add all that back in, I think things are fine Alex. No real issue there. I would say on product categories, what I\u2019m most worried about kind of what I\u2019ve always most worried about. It\u2019s alliances. So that\u2019s why we bought SimplePlex. We\u2019re big in Luminex. We\u2019ve got an assay portfolio that is together. It\u2019s high single-digit growth and hopefully you\u2019ve acted back to double-digit here soon when it all comes, but allies up and down low, mid, high single digits. That\u2019s kind of where it lies, and it\u2019s still a big part of our business. So it\u2019s kind of that. Alex Nowak : Okay. Makes sense. And then the path to $2 billion of sales from the Analyst Day, I mean, it looks like we\u2019re going to need about 22% annualized growth to get us there. It sounds like maybe teens for next year. So that really pays on Wilson Wolf GMP protein spatial to be massive accelerators in fiscal 2025, 2026. Is that right or the full $2 billion number need to be updated? Chuck Kummeth : I wouldn\u2019t really update that yet because we were ahead of the game here less than a year ago from the accelerated growth that we had, we are more or less ahead everybody expected. Yes, this year, we\u2019ve given some back. And yes, we still got a few years to go. We need cell and gene therapy to light it up. We need spatial to keep going in double digit. And we need Exosome to remain in this high growth accelerated level it is. So they become material enough to help us get there. But we are growing faster than we need over the aggregate. The aggregate number in both Exosome as well as cell and gene therapy to hit that number, it\u2019s 50% growth in roughly that area, and we\u2019re about there and in the protein stuff, and we\u2019re well exceeding that in cell and gene therapy or in Exosome. Spatial needs to be solid double digit as well. I\u2019d say we\u2019re a little behind. We need to be there. But we have new things coming as well. So it\u2019s too soon to say it\u2019s going to be 1.9 or 1.95, it could easily right now still be 2.1. And Wilson Wolf that whole area is a big kicker, icing on the cake, right? So and lot of the stuff takes 10 years out. We\u2019re just doing a lot of things are going to take a while to develop, but that they really hit their stride three, four years out. So. Operator : Thank you very much. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Chuck Kummeth for any closing remarks. Chuck Kummeth : Well, great. Thanks, everyone, for attending. I\u2019m glad that we kind of put the expectation set last quarter and a little better on the bottom line. And I think they were in great shape looking forward in this quarter. The team is in great shape. We were to go in the energy side, and we\u2019ll talk to you then. Thank you. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Separately, we will be hosting an Investor Day on September 8 in New York City and also participating in the UBS, Baird and Morgan Stanley conferences in August and September. We look forward to connecting with many of you at these upcoming events. I will now turn the call over to Chuck. Chuck Kummeth : Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter conference call. We finished our fiscal 2023 largely as expected with 5% fourth quarter organic growth nearing the growth we delivered for full fiscal 2023 and capped a year where we successfully navigated a transitory macroeconomic environment. I'm extremely proud of the team's ability to deliver this growth in the face of transitory headwinds, which we refer to as the COVID hangover that we faced for the majority of this past fiscal year. These post-COVID induced headwinds included a softer biotech funding environment, inventory destocking from a subset of our OEM customers and macroeconomic challenges in China. Despite these challenges, the endurance of our key growth platforms was demonstrated yet again in Q4 and double-digit growth in our ProteinSimple branded instrument portfolio, spatial biology ACD platform, cell and gene therapy workflow solutions, and our liquid biopsy exosome platform. Now let's get into the details a bit, starting with an overview of our performance by geography and end market. In North America, we grew mid-single digits for both the quarter and the fiscal year. This may appear underwhelming. However, keep in mind that North America grew over 20% for the quarter and full year in fiscal 2022 driven by our biopharma end markets that was on fire with over 30% growth. With that kind of comp, as you can imagine, North America faced the greatest headwind from lower biotech funding this year. Europe had a great quarter to end the year with low double-digit growth in Q4, finishing the year with growth in the high single digits. This was on top of a comp from last year that was also incredibly strong with growth in the mid-teens for both Q4 and full year fiscal 2022. Now for the region that is on everyone's minds China. China is a region that has faced the most volatility throughout COVID and even now during the COVID hangover, you will recall during our third quarter conference call, we talked about how we saw our business in China come roaring back once everyone there was recovered from the COVID illness and back to work after the Chinese New Year. That strength continued through the first half of Q4 then abruptly stalled when the annual funding of new programs from the Chinese government did not occur as it usually does during the April-May timeframe. Despite this delay in funding, our team in China was still able to execute extremely well and delivered growth in the mid-teens for Q4. However, at this moment, it is still unclear when government funding of new programs in life sciences will resume. History suggests however, they won't be long. And when it returned, we expect the growth to be robust. While COVID and its aftermath have been extremely disruptive to business in China, it has only strengthened the long-term thesis that the pursuit of better healthcare in China will continue to be a top national priority. We are positioned extremely well with our differentiated portfolio to enable China in their pursuit. In the meantime, we will continue to serve our customers in China by providing them the tools to make their research as productive as possible with the funds they have. Now let's discuss our growth platform, starting with our Protein Sciences segment, where we grew 4% in both the quarter and the fiscal year. This growth was delivered on a particularly challenging comparison for both the quarter and fiscal year, where we grew 16% and 19% in the prior year periods, respectively. During the quarter, we advanced our cell and gene therapy initiatives as our reagents, media and analytical workflow solutions continue to aid our customers' progress on therapy, development and clinical trials. Collectively, our portfolio of cell and gene therapy products grew almost 30% in Q4 and are positioned to remain a key growth driver going forward. This strong performance puts an exclamation point on a year where despite a soft biotech funding environment, our cell and gene therapy business increased over 20% for the full year. For GMP proteins, we continue to offer the broadest menu in the market, including GMP proteins for immuno-oncology therapies as well as an industry-leading portfolio for regenerative medicine applications. These proteins are manufactured with a high level of bioactivity, lot-to-lot consistency and purity has become synonymous with our R&D Systems brand of reagents. This unique offering and our reputation as the highest quality producer drove Q4 growth of almost 60% and our third consecutive quarter of record GMP protein revenue. It's worth noting that over 400 cell therapy accounts have used our GMP proteins to date, over 20% more accounts than in the prior year. Additionally, we are in the very early stages of realizing the large cross-selling opportunities that exist within our GMP protein customer base and the broader Bio-Techne portfolio and has strategies in place to drive adoption of RUO reagents, immunoassays, cell culture products, analytical tools and spatial biology solutions throughout these accounts. Factoring in our pending Wilson Wolf acquisition and their roster of approximately 800 customers that we have access to via ScaleReady, this immense cross-selling opportunity becomes even larger. Our GMP portfolio is not unique [indiscernible] proteins as we also offer GMP versions of several reagents within our small molecule portfolio. As a reminder, our small molecules are critical ingredients for cell reprogramming, expansion and differentiation, which represent critical stages in regenerative medicine workflows. High demand for our portfolio of GMP small molecules drove growth of over 250% in the quarter, and we are adding capacity to meet current and anticipated demand for these key bioactive reagents. There are other areas of our vast portfolio of reagents and media that are ripe for GMP offerings, including antibodies, and we will continue to develop and commercialize products to meet growing demand for these key products going forward. Moving on to our catalog of RUO, or research use only reagents, which includes over 6,000 proteins and 400,000 antibody types. As a reminder, researchers rely on these reagents as key inputs for their experiments as these consumable products enable critical functions within the lab, including cell growth and differentiation, disease monitoring, cell imaging, immunoassays, immunohistochemistry, Western blots and other foundational research functions. The majority of our RUO reagent business is a run rate, where researchers order proteins, antibodies and small molecules as needed for their ongoing research. These reagents also serve as content for a handful of OEM customers where they purchase our reagents frequently, antibodies as a key component of their end products, which in turn generate royalties for Bio-Techne. As predicted, we expect that a destocking effect again in Q4 with a handful of these OEM customers as they work their way through excess inventory, stocked out of caution during the COVID induced industry supply chain crunch. We expect this destocking dynamic to gradually wind down over the next six months before normal ordering patterns resume for these customers in the back half of our fiscal 2024. During the quarter, we announced that we prevailed on a claim that one of our competitors, Miltenyi Biosciences, commercialized antibodies that is obtained by reverse engineering two of Bio-Techne's proprietary R&D Systems branded antibodies. Bio-Techne takes great pride in the fact that our proprietary products are the result of our own internally developed intellectual property. We have a long history of selectively sharing our intellectual property with academic and biopharma partners through licensing arrangements, but will vigorously defend our position against any unlawful use of our proprietary discoveries. Continuing with the Protein Sciences segment, let's discuss the performance of our ProteinSimple branded portfolio of instruments and consumables where we delivered low double-digit growth in the quarter. The Q4 performance was led by nearly 20% growth in our fully automated Western blot solution branded as Simple Western. The platform's ability to reduce the two-day long manual messy Western blotting process into a three-hour push button, highly reproducible solution continues to drive demand within our biopharma and academic customer bases. We are also seeing robust adoption of Simple Western and gene therapy applications with the system increasingly being utilized to measure protein expression potency, empty versus full capsid ratio and to detect process impurities. Our biologics business increased upper single digits for the quarter on top of a comp of nearly 40% growth last year as we experienced strong demand and initial sales of our MauriceFlex instrument. As a reminder, MauriceFlex as protein charge variant fractionation capabilities to Maurice's legacy protein identity, charge and purity capabilities, fractionation of the frontend step to mass spectrometry and MauriceFlex resolves the labor-intensive and time-consuming challenges of using legacy fractionation methods, including ion-exchange chromatography. This new application enters Maurice into a new $300 million market, approximately doubling the addressable market opportunity for the instrument. We are very encouraged by the strong initial response to this exciting new instrument. For our Simple Plex automated multiplexing ELISA instrument branded as Ella, we continue to build the menu of assays launching 36 validated Simple Plex assays on the platform during fiscal 2023 including four AAV titer assays for gene therapy and five neuroscience markers. Going forward, neuroscience and cell and gene therapy represent large opportunities for Ella and both remain a focus of application development and menu expansion initiatives. During the quarter, we also made significant progress positioning Ella as a clinical diagnostics platform as we successfully completed the ISO 1345 audit of our Wallingford facility and are waiting to hear back on the results. With this certification in hand, we will be ready to pursue clinical diagnostic opportunities opening a large potential end market for this highly sensitive, easy-to-use and fast multiplexing immunoassay instruments. Now let's discuss our Diagnostics and Genomics segment, where organic revenue increased 10% for the quarter and 8% for the fiscal year. I'll start with our Molecular Diagnostics business, where we once again drove significant growth in our ExoDx prostate test as the valuable information on whether a man with an indeterminate PSA score should proceed with an invasive and potentially dangerous prostate biopsy continues to resonate with both patients and physicians. ExoDx prostate volume and associated revenue both increased nearly 70% compared to the prior year quarter capping a breakout year for the test where volume increased by over 70%, revenue increased over 90%, and we surpassed 100,000 ExoDx tests performed to date. The value of our ExoDx prostate test was further solidified with the recent publication in the Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases Journal of interim results from a randomized study of over 1,000 patients designed to show the clinical utility of the test. In the study, patients identified as low risk by the ExoDx prostate test received fewer biopsies, significantly deferred the time to their first biopsy, and we're significantly less likely to be diagnosed in the future with high-grade prostate cancer. The growing acceptance of the test, strong clinical utility data, a Medicare local coverage decision is now reflective of the NCCN guidelines and includes reimbursement for repeat annual testing as well as a fortified sales force and market access team positioned fiscal 2024 to be another record year for our ExoDx prostate test. Now let's discuss our Spatial Biology franchise, which includes our ACD branded portfolio of more than 45,000 probes in over 400 species that enable biomarker imaging at single molecule sensitivity in single cell resolution. Our spatial biology business increased low double digits in both Q4 and the fiscal year. The growing interest and utilization of our ACD technology as the go-to technology for translational spatial biology research applications is apparent in the growing number of publications citing the technology, which increased over 10% during the first half of calendar 2023 and now totaled over 8,000. Within the portfolio, we are experiencing continued momentum in BaseScope, which enables the detection of short RNA target sequences and microRNA scope, which allows for the visualization of ASO, microRNA and siRNA, and other nucleic acid targets as these highly sensitive and specific assays increased over 20% and 30% respectively in Q4. Following the robust growth for both the quarter and the fiscal year, BaseScope and microRNA scope are both becoming increasingly more spatial to our overall spatial biology franchise. Separately, we furthered the partnering strategy for our gold standard RNAscope technology with the release of our of an RNAscope multiomic workflow for the standard Biotools Hyperion Imaging System. We also expanded our growing arsenal of ASR probes with the launch of RNAscope probes for Kappa and Lambda and as analyte specific reagents or ASRs. Kappa and Lambda are important oncology biomarkers for B-cell lymphomas and these ASRs will enable CLIA labs to develop customized tests while maintaining high standards of analytical and clinical performance. Finally, I\u2019d like to officially welcome the Lunaphore team to Bio-Techne. As a reminder, we recently closed the Lunaphore acquisition, which is the 18th acquisition our team is closed during my tenure as CEO. This acquisition strengthens our spatial biology franchise while adding a talented group of innovators to the company. Our strong track record of identifying state-of-the-art platforms and technologies on the cusp of significant market uptake in growth like Lunaphore has been a key driver of our double-digit revenue in total stock return CAGR over the last 10 years. This acquisition builds off of partnership we announced with Lunaphore earlier this year. The two companies partnered to develop the first fully automated multiomics spatial biology platform. This novel offering will be capable of simultaneously interrogating protein and RNA expression at a single cell revolution using a fully automated same slide workflow pairing Lunaphore\u2019s COMET instrument inspire antibody panels with our legacy RNAscope high-plex technology. COMET is early in its initial commercialization, but the system\u2019s end-to-end capabilities that fully automate staining imaging and image pre-processing steps. Use of conjugated antibodies and high throughput design is generating significant interest, market traction and placements. In summary, Q4 concludes the fiscal year where the team successfully navigated several challenges facing the company and the broader life sciences tool industry. While the short-term macro challenges are not over, we are encouraged that they will gradually diminish in the year ahead. Starting with the less challenging comps from the COVID halo [ph] days, less destocking by our OEM customers from the COVID hangover days, and a more stable biotech funding environment going forward. While Q4 was a good quarter for us in China, the funding environment in China will likely be a big challenge for at least the first half of the year. But don\u2019t doubt [ph] China\u2019s resolved for better healthcare and we believe when the funding returns, it will come back strong. As this past year has proven, our stable of growth platforms can persevere in good times as well as challenging ones. We\u2019ll continue to prioritize and focus our execution on these growth platforms which propel this company to accelerated growth and profitability in the years to come. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jim. Jim Hippel : Thanks, Chuck. I\u2019ll start with some additional detail on our Q4 and fiscal 2023 financial performance and then give some thoughts on the financial outlook for the year ahead. Starting with the overall fourth quarter financial performance, adjusted EPS was $0.55, compared to $0.51 in the prior year quarter, an increase of 8% over last year. Foreign exchange negatively impacted adjusted EPS by a $0.01 or minus 2% in the quarter. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.47, compared to $0.38 in the prior year. Q4 revenue was $301.3 million, an increase of 5% year-over-year on both an organic and reported basis. For the full fiscal year 2023, revenue was over $1.1 billion, an increase of 3% on a reported basis and 5% on an organic basis. Foreign exchange translation had an unfavorable impact of 2% and acquisitions had an immaterial impact on our full fiscal year revenue growth. Moving on to our organic growth by region and end market in Q4, North America grew mid-single digits. Europe increased low-double digits and China grew mid-teens in the quarter. As Chuck already mentioned, the growth in North America and Europe was on top of very high comps from the prior year when they were experiencing what we now refer to as the COVID halo effect. China was more volatile as it has been all year. It\u2019s a very strong first half of the quarter followed by a rather weak half. Nonetheless, the mid-teens growth rate we delivered in China appears to be one of the best results along our life science tool company peers, and speaks to the overall resiliency and value that our bioactive reagents, analytic tools and spatial biology solutions delivered to our customers in the region. APAC outside of China declined low-single digits overall with similar COVID hangover induced challenges as China in several countries in the region. By end market in Q4, biopharma grew mid-single digits on top of very tough comps in the prior year. While academia grew upper single digits. Similar to our Q3 destocking by a handful of our Protein Sciences, OEM licensing and supply customers negatively impacted overall company revenue growth by approximately 2%. [Indiscernible] revenue on the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin was 71.6% in the quarter compared to 73.2% in the prior year. The decreased was primarily driven by unfavorable product mix. Adjusted SG&A in Q4 was 26.8% of revenue, compared to 27.8% in the prior year. While R&D expense in Q4 was 7.8% of revenue compared to 8.1% in the prior year. The decrease in relative SG&A and R&D was driven by operational efficiencies and diligent expense management, which was partially offset by ongoing strategic growth investments. The businesses implemented strategic price increases during the first half of fiscal year 2023 to offset the dollar impact of inflation to operating income with pricing also largely offsetting the inflation impact on our operating margin in Q4. Adjusted operating margin for Q4 was 37.1%, a decrease of 30 basis points from the prior year period, a 10 basis point improvement sequentially. Excluding Namocell acquisition from earlier this fiscal year, adjusted operating margin was 40 basis points higher than the prior year due diligent cost management and prioritization. Looking at our numbers below operating income, net interest expense in Q4 was $2.5 million, increasing $0.3 million compared to the prior year due to higher debt levels partially offset by higher interest income earned on cash deposits. Our bank debt on the balance sheet as of the end of Q4 stood at $350 million, a decrease to $20 million compared to last quarter.  I would note we closed the Lunaphore acquisition at the beginning of this current fiscal year, which was partially funded by debt and cash on hand and we anticipate our net interest expense to increase sequentially to approximately $4.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024. Other adjusted not operating expense was $0.1 million in the quarter, a decrease of $1.3 million compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting our 20% share of Wilson Wolf adjusted net income, which amounted to $1.7 million a quarter more than offset by the foreign exchange impact related to our cash pooling arrangements. Moving further down the P&L, our adjusted effective tax rate in Q4 was 19.2%. Turning to cash flow and return of capital, $83.4 million of cash was generated from operations in the quarter and our net investment in capital expenditures was $10.8 million. Also during Q4, we returned capital to shareholders by way of $12.5 million in dividends. We finished the quarter with 161.9 million average diluted shares outstanding. Our balance sheet finished Q4 in a strong position with $204.3 million in cash and short term available for sale investments. And our total leverage ratio remained well below one times TTM EBITDA. Going forward, M&A remains a top priority for capital allocation. Next, I\u2019ll discuss the performance of our reporting segments, starting with the Protein Sciences segment. Q4 reported sales were $223 million with reported revenue increasing 3% compared to the same period last year. Organic growth for this segment was 4% with foreign exchange having unfavorable impact of 1%. As a reminder, our Protein Sciences segment that has the most exposure to biotech funding considerations, the OEM destocking that has occurred among our licensing and commercial supply customers, as well as to the China geographic region. Operating margin for the Protein Sciences segment was 44.7%, a decrease of 20 basis points year-over-year driven by the impact of the Namocell acquisition. Turning to the Diagnostics and Genomics segment. Q4 reported sales were $79 million with reported and organic revenue both increasing 10%. Our Exosome Diagnostics business remain very strong in the quarter as our fortified marketing message, strong clinical data strength in commercial team and the recently updated Medicare LCD drove test volume and revenue growth. Also, our spatial biology business delivered low-double digit growth in the quarter with strong performances in our RNAscope, BaseScope, and microRNA product line. As Chuck highlighted earlier, we are very excited about our recent acquisition of Lunaphore and expect it\u2019ll add at least 1.5% to the company\u2019s reported growth in fiscal year 2024 with a standalone growth rate over a 100%. Moving on to the Diagnostics and Genomics segment, operating margin at 18.5%, the segment\u2019s operating margin increased 280 basis points, compared to the prior year. The segment\u2019s operating margin was favorably impacted by volume leverage. Before we get to Q&A, I will summarize our fiscal year 2023 and how it shapes our view for the upcoming fiscal 2024 as follows. We view fiscal 2023 as the year of the COVID hangover, which followed two extremely strong years that we refer to as the COVID halo. This hangover included a more risk off mentality for smaller biotech investing, government induced shutdowns in our highest growth region that be in China and destocking of excessive inventories that took place during the COVID induced supply chain crunch. Through it all and as Q4 demonstrated, our growth platforms are still winning with double-digit growth.  Now the question on everyone\u2019s mind is, will a COVID hangover last as long as the COVID halo did? Well, as with everyone else, we don\u2019t have a crystal ball that gives us that answer. We do see is that biotech spending has stabilized. Therefore, we are hopeful that going into fiscal year 2024, this headwind we faced in fiscal year 2023 is diminished. However, we haven\u2019t noticed any meaningful increases in biotech funding that would suggest this becomes a tailwind anytime soon. We do estimate that destocking from our OEM licensing and commercial supply customers will unwind by the end of this calendar year and should become a tailwind in calendar year 2024 as buying from these customers resumed. As Chuck described earlier, China took its surprising and sudden reversal and revenue trajectory halfway through the most recent fourth quarter when the usual annual cycle of renewed government funding did not occur. Until funding of life sciences by the Chinese government returns, tools companies like us will see continued headwinds in this region. When will government funding of life sciences return in China is anyone\u2019s guess. The given China\u2019s history and publicly stated importance of life sciences to their sovereign strategy, we expect that the funding will return sooner rather than later, and when it does, it will be strong. So what does this all potentially mean for our fiscal year 2024? Well, we believe it means that we will need to grow primarily by gaining wallet share in this cautionary financial environment just as we did for the entirety of fiscal year 2023. We\u2019ll continue to do this by selectively investing and promoting our long-term growth platforms, namely cell and gene therapy, liquid biopsy, spatial biology, and our analytical instrument platforms. Thus, we expect our organic revenue growth in the first half of fiscal year 2024 to be similar to our organic growth in fiscal year 2023. With regards to the back half of our fiscal year, there is a path to accelerating growth rates and OEM purchasing returns and if China government funding of life sciences occurs before the next Chinese New Year. As we look to adjusted operating margins for the year ahead, we estimate they will be down approximately 300 basis points from fiscal year 2023, mostly driven by our acquisition of Lunaphore and to a lesser extent due to continued selective investment in our key growth platforms as well as our overall customer digital experience. These investments together with the acquisition of Lunaphore will ensure that we stay on track of our long-term growth goals as macro conditions improve. Margins can improve slightly from this base case depending on if and by how much revenue growth rates improve in the second half of the year. That concludes my prepared comments. And with that, I will turn the call back over the operator to open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners. Puneet Souda : Hey, Chuck, Jim. Thanks for taking the questions. Jim, I really appreciate your thoughts on the guide versus all the uncertainties that the sector is facing. But a few more questions there. How should we think about expectations for North America and Europe, given the growth that you're seeing despite the comp that you have \u2013 how much of that is a strength that is sustainable? And then when we look at 2024, as you mentioned, in the first half being sort of mid-single digits similar line to the full year of 2023, do we think we could improve in the second half to potentially get to at least maybe high single-digits for fiscal year 2024? I know it's really hard to look at that, but there is a number of moving parts and just want to understand how you're thinking about those different moving parts, including China destocking and what that all means in numbers for 2024 and organic, if you could? Thank you. Chuck Kummeth : Yes. Thanks, Puneet. Let me start off with some high-level comments around that because your question is going to be repeated about 29 time today, probably. So I think, first of all, we're one of the first companies to kind of come out and talk about the hangover beginning about a year ago, next quarter. And we talked about we'll be coming on the front end a lot sooner and we really are. In fact, this quarter, if China wouldn't have been a surprise, we would have been really ahead of where everyone expected us to be so \u2013 by a little bit anyway. So it's really all China. We'll get to that in a minute. North America, stacked up okay about as expected. Europe has actually came in stronger than expected and is turning the corner, but they went south before North America did, so we expected that as well. Behind the scenes, you guys don't know is a lot of work we've done in this off year of doing the homework and getting ready for the come out party, right? So we have hired three senior executives. We have a new leader in Europe. We have a new commercial leader for North America from [indiscernible]. We have a new divisional Senior Vice President for RSD. We have \u2013 we are fully done reorganizing Europe commercially and we're \u2013 with Peter's guidance, we're kind of relaunching and we're probably already seeing a little bit of what's happening from that with a stronger finish here. North America even coming yet further now with the coming of James Snook we're making a lot of changes, a lot of observations he's made, and those are going to start paying off. We've been at full strength in our other segment for a while. We're actually still short of \u2013 it's very aggressive and spatial, as you know, very, very competitive. And we're \u2013 we seem like to always be down one rep, but we're only down one rep, we're not down five. We're increasing there. We're increasing inventories and efficiencies, especially in Europe. So this has been \u2013 there's lot to talk about on digital side and ERPs and what we're doing on making our customer experience much better. We've made huge improvements there in the last quarter or two as well. All these are really coming \u2013 are coming in place, so we're ready for the new wave of growth they hit, which is going to be starting, I think, this coming quarter. We have softened a little bit for this first half, as you noticed Jim's comments, but it's kind of unknown. And we need to wait and see what happens at China. I think China surprised us all a little bit this quarter. It started out really good, by the way. I mean, really good for us and just shut down the second half of the quarter. We do expect government will come around and start funding again, but they haven't yet, so it's hard to get too ahead of things. If they don't, well then it will be more of the same for a while, and that's for everybody. And we had literally results that beat everybody in our field this quarter. So it's all about the forward not what's happened though, right? So we feel really good about where things ended up. As you notice, we met our bottom line. We're operational experts here. We all come from large companies. We know how to operate, and we nailed every, every target we had to nail. But growth is growth, and we can't make markets do what markets won't do. And so we're ready for the coming back party when it's coming and \u2013 especially in China, but we're already seeing it in other areas like we commented on. And let's hope Europe continues its progression back. And we're really only all talking about our core here. I mean it's RSD and it's in the instrument side, not the consumables, which are killing it, by the way, not all our instruments, and everything on the other segment, our three major investment platforms, spatial and cell and gene therapy and exosome, all had banner quarters and a banner year, really exceeding expectations on many fronts. So \u2013 and that's \u2013 by next year, doing more of the same, which it will, maybe even accelerating will start becoming much more material and can offset any headwind we have in our core anymore. So with that, maybe Jim wants to comment on the numbers, but I think it's -- we don't want to cover the same question with everybody. It's kind of just setting the stage for the day. We're really thrilled this quarter, to be honest, especially as we saw more and more of our peers come out with horrendous numbers, we feel really good \u2013 and we are \u2013 we came out last quarter after a trip to China, who were telling us they'd be a 50% quarter. We told you'd probably be 40% hedging a bit and we ended up around 20%, still better than everybody. But with the government shutting everything down, it just is what it is right now, and it will be a soft quarter, but I think when they turn the lights back on, which will happen probably within a quarter or so more than likely, it's China for God's sake, we're going to be off like a terror, I think, quite simply, and we're ready. And we spent this last year working on our infrastructure. And sometime in the coming quarters, we've got to tell you more about our new expanded website, our one Bio-Techne, where we're getting everything and put in one place for customers to really, really improve their experience and it's already starting to pay off for us. So... Puneet Souda : No, that's very \u2013 that's super helpful, Chuck, and thanks for the great context there. I'll spare Jim and Co come back to \u2013 for more questions for him on the follow-up call, but just maybe one final one for me. Any updated thoughts on M&A? You talked about 18 acquisitions so far. How do you think \u2013 how are you thinking about the life sciences side versus the diagnostics side, obviously, Exosome Diagnostics is doing good. You didn't \u2013 I didn't hear you much on Asuragen. How are you thinking about M&A overall? Chuck Kummeth : We feel really good. As you know, we just pulled off Lunaphore. That was an asset. I came and tell you how many people wanted that asset. We've been working on a long time. As you know, we're very ubiquitous, working with everybody in spatial and we have an open platform kind of a mentality here and Lunaphore is no different, other [indiscernible] work in that platform. But that thing is going to be amazing. And it's going to allow us to actually go after much stronger, not only in research, but on the pathology side without really getting crossing over into areas we don't want to create any conflicts or partners like \u2013 and others, so \u2013 which are all okay with all this. But we need to figure out a way to automate and get more out of our discovery, our platform, translational down in the under 10 Plex without taking two weeks, 24/7 running assays by hand. We can do all that now, so we need this platform, and it's ready to go. The synergies are amazing. Jim talked about the numbers. They're going to easily be those numbers and we've got a couple of points of dilution here in the coming year as we always do with a bigger acquisition. But this thing is already growing and already heavy in the revenue, and we're not waiting a year or two for this going to take off. It's already happening, and there's a strong future. So that is one area. Other M&A, we're \u2013 I don't think we've ever been busier. We're busy on more than a few right now. And as we already said it should be a big M&A year, everyone is staying the same. Smaller companies aren't being able to IPO right now, a lot of funding issues. It's the time for finding partners and new owners, and we're very busy and there's a lot of areas we're still looking to address things like in cell and gene therapy and media and other areas that they're all coming. And there is a lot of proteomics companies. They're all starting to look outside at being acquired, even it's very public, even Abcam is for sale, and I wouldn't have thought that would have happened yet, but there is a lot of surprises out there in the market these days. Puneet Souda : Super. All right. Thanks guys. Operator : The next question comes from Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Patrick Donnelly : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Jim, maybe one on the margin outlook there down 300 bps. I know you mentioned Lunaphore dilution. Can you just talk about maybe a bridge of M&A dilution versus kind of the organic number? And I guess just that path obviously you guys have the long-term target out there of the 40%. What are the key levers you can pull to maybe get that margin going a little bit on the core side? Chuck Kummeth : So I'd say over two third of that dilution is driven strictly by the Lunaphore acquisition. The rest has to do with like our continued strategic investments in those growth areas that we've talked about during this call. We see it \u2013 if you exclude Lunaphore from our results, we see \u2013 similar to this past year, we see our organic margin being \u2013 finishing the year better than we did this year. We \u2013 it be just the Lunaphore that brings it down below. I think with regards to triggers that could improve on those margins, it's largely a revenue gain. I mean like I mentioned in my opening \u2013 in my comments, if revenue increases, the more revenue improvement, the growth improves in the back half of the year, the better there is to get more leverage of our cost base and increase margins. But we're already being very, very prudent on our \u2013 definitely on our discretionary spend and extremely selective in prioritizing our strategic spend. But we're not going to not do those strategic investments to sacrifice our growth in the future. But I think the biggest lever for improving margins would be higher revenue growth in the back half of the year. Patrick Donnelly : Yes. Understood. Okay. And Chuck, maybe one for you just on the stocking comment, assuming the destocking maybe ends in six months or so. Can you just talk about the visibility into that? I guess any level of confidence out of six months obviously has been a moving target, not only for you but for the entire industry. Can you mention do you have any customer conversations, would certainly be helpful. Chuck Kummeth : Yes. As we've mentioned in the past, in previous quarters, we've talked about missing double-digit growth by literally a handful of OEM customers. And that's kind of more of the same. It's very lumpy for us. So a lot of our larger OEMs and especially in antibodies areas they were stocking a lot through the COVID supply risk era. And it's already coming down. So that's moving in the right direction. I think we have seen through that period \u2013 period, let's call it, two or three quarters ago, we had very strong run rate still and those have softened because of funding overall softened. So we're seeing a bit of a barbell shift here, but not dramatic. So other data point is like Fisher, Fisher is very strong, has been strong all year. So a lot of our channels look good. So it's pretty lumpy. It's very, very targeted. We kind of know by customer exactly where they're at. And as you know, we get \u2013 we got a lot of these guys are licensed in a lot of royalties and stuff. So we not only have decent metrics, but we have actual data from them on just how they're doing, what they're buying, what they expect and their outlook. So a brighter year ahead and I think by end of this calendar year, certainly next year, the things will be recovered there in a lot of the OEM areas. So that's the main difference, I think, still. Patrick Donnelly : Yes. Okay. And if I could just sneak one last one in on China. Anybody could give kind of the exit rate? I know obviously, it sounds like linearity, it was strong at beginning, kind of eroded a little bit as the quarter ends. Anyway to just think about the exit rate July, how do you think about this year and were there different markets that kind of faded quickly? Thank you. Chuck Kummeth : Well, I'm not sure we can say any more than we know and we've been very transparent. We always have been. This quarter started off great in China, ended terribly and it ended much worse for everybody else we know in our industry. I think we're all in this kind of waiting pattern for the government. I think they have their economy shutdown so badly that I don't think they have any money. So \u2013 but we do know they're very public about how \u2013 what a priority healthcare is. And so I think as they get back on track, and we're told that come October, it's the new school year and all the institutions reopening is when they expect things to start getting better and start seeing an outlay. There have been some initial targeted stimulus areas, but nothing dramatic. This is just really a downtime for China. It's very, very surprising to everybody, but where they are on the scale of 1 to 10 of getting health care across the country, their whole population to where the rest of the world is. They're like a two. So it's the big cities that are really in good shape, but you don't have to go too far out to see a lot of struggle and the government is certainly still on their plan and healthcare is the number one priority, and I don't expect anything will change there. So \u2013 we've been here before, wondering about China, and then it comes back like a roaring tiger. So I expect that to be sometime before end of the calendar year here, but \u2013 Operator : Next question\u2026 Chuck Kummeth : Our team there is very bullish just by the \u2013 they didn't sound any alarm. So it's surprised even them. So I think that's also a good sign is that the 200-plus employees, strong team we have in China is really very positive and very, I guess, very \u2013 sees a very big future ahead. So\u2026 Operator : Next question comes from Jacob Johnson with Stephens. Jacob Johnson : Hi. Good morning, everybody. Chuck, I suppose I apologize for attributing to the 29 questions about 2024. But maybe on the instrument side of things, a strong quarter there. Just any thoughts about how we should be thinking about that business into 2024. I guess in particular, you talked about the MauriceFlex being a contributor this quarter, sounds like Ella could move into the clinic maybe next year that could be an opportunity. And then maybe on the bad guy side, China is something we should be looking out for, but just any kind of commentary around the outlook for instruments. Chuck Kummeth : Yes. Well, China is the area we actually have our strongest ratio of instrument sales for business. So it's really 50 :50 with our core. It's nowhere like that anywhere else. So with China being so soft, it takes a big hit on the overall instrument. We are in pretty good shape in Simple Western and across the board, not too bad, but mainly from consumables. I mean the instruments are being used, and they're really good productivity instruments were known for that and that has gone great. Ella had a pretty good quarter overall. And yes, the 1345 is coming. It should have been here a month ago, the paperwork, but it's definitely coming. We have a big clinical launch with that application in India that's through their there \u2013 they would be like a 510(k) process or a predicate process here, but they're ready to go very soon. 2,000 person clinical on macro degeneration and eye \u2013 different eye-related illnesses using tears [ph] as the analyte in the cartridge. So that's coming. And then we have a bunch more. But I'm going to let Will say a couple of words here. I think the future \u2013 now we have \u2013 we're getting more and more instruments, but we're getting more and more applications of the instruments we have. Simple Western isn't just about converting Western blots anymore. There's a bunch more stuff coming. Flex isn't just about protein purity in the line of manufacturing anymore. Now there's a lot more things come. But Will, maybe a couple of words on where you see the future of our instruments and buy application, and the growth actually improving what we see now. Will Geist : Yes. Thanks, Chuck, and thanks for the question, Jacob. A couple of things. Chuck already hit on some of the nice indicators for our future, right? As we look at consumables utilization, super strong this last quarter. We also look at service contracts. We know these instruments are being leveraged and used across the industry. So those are real positives. When we look to the future, you hit on one thing, and I'll come back to the ISO 1345 certification of our Ella platform in a second, but as we think kind of these emerging growth applications areas like cell and gene therapy, we launched 35 new application nodes across the Simple Western, excuse me, the ProteinSimple portfolio, so those are for Simple Western more recent platforms. So things like AAV titer, empty-full capsid ratios, potency assays, for example, on Simple Western. Even recently in an FDA approved product, the potency assay \u2013 release assay is run on Simple Western. For confidentiality, we can\u2019t share what that is, but it gives you an indicator there of how strong we are. If we look at our applications on Ella, in addition to the cell and gene therapy applications for potency, we\u2019ve got five new neuro applications. We expect that space to take off for us as we fill out the rest of that portfolio. And then finally hitting on Ello with the ISO 1345 certification pending, what we\u2019ve already seen is really strong adoption because the platform just lends itself so well to clinical applications. We\u2019ve already seen nice adoption in laboratory developed tests. We know that 1345 will enable our customers to kind of take their assays, put them on those boxes, and start driving broader clinical adoption. Jacob Johnson : Got it. And thanks for that Will, and that\u2019s a good segue. Chuck, I wanted to go back to cell and gene therapy. I think that\u2019s been in some ways a poster child for biotech funding concerns. I think the commentary around the end markets has varied depending on the company. But you had a good quarter there. It seems like new customer wins may be helped on the GMP side, it seems like small molecules trending well, maybe just talk about what\u2019s driving that growth? And then two, just kind of the potential for new products in that space. It sounded like you alluded to GMP antibodies, but curious what else you\u2019re thinking about on that side of things? Chuck Kummeth : Yes. Yes. The answer fully would take an hour. There\u2019s so much to good news to cover there. We had an exceptional quarter beat everybody I\u2019ve ever noticed in the space quite blow and blew everybody away really. But 60% [ph] growth is pretty good. 30% for the year in proteins. We\u2019ve gone from six products in our St. Paul facility, we\u2019ll be to \u2013 we\u2019ll be adding another eight this coming year. So we\u2019re getting way beyond just cell therapies, more on the regenerative side as well. Strength is on all cylinders. We were quoting roughly 250 customers to 300 customers up until this quarter. We\u2019re now over 400 customers. So a lot of that growth is coming from new customers. And yes, there may be a doldrum in the industry now, but when it comes to cell therapies, it\u2019s still much a growing area and we\u2019re growing and taking share and getting more visibility. We\u2019re becoming real after laying track here for five, six years. We are going to be one of the big guys. It\u2019s just going to happen. It\u2019s inevitable. And of course, our partnerships and our coming acquisition will smoke\u2019s [ph] going to help. They\u2019ve still got 100 customers. It is probably the only de facto standard out there for bioreactor and cell therapy that\u2019s helping the new sister company CellReady is being used as well. So we\u2019ve got ScaleReady and CellReady that those platforms are working and it\u2019s driving more business our way for proteins and across our portfolio, a small molecule, not a bad number, 260% growth this quarter. And for the year over 114, we\u2019ve been waiting a long time for our small molecule platform to really take off, and now it finally really is and it\u2019s \u2013 there\u2019s no stopping it now. Did that put you to sleep? Operator : The next question comes from Dan Arias from Stifel. Dan Arias : Good morning guys. Thanks. Chuck, I guess I\u2019m going to apologize too here, just because I really don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to have a company that finishes their fiscal year and doesn\u2019t offer a full year outlook. And obviously, they\u2019re all dealing with a set of challenging circumstances. And Jim, it seems like you\u2019re offering a view on the harder portion of the year to forecast, just given that China is a tough call right now. So I guess, why wouldn\u2019t you be willing to commit to more meaningful acceleration in the second half of the year if you expect some of these issues to resolve themselves in the shorter term rather than the longer term, which is what I think Chuck said there. And the comps are basically the same first half versus second half. Jim Hippel : Well, first of all, the peer companies out there that are giving guidance for the year through the rest of this calendar year 2023, we\u2019re in a fortunate position where we\u2019re \u2013 have a fiscal year and that\u2019s six months further out. So we\u2019re putting our necks out there with regards to 2024. And I don\u2019t think anyone has, can read the tea leaves as to exactly when this code hangover completely resolves itself. I mean, at the end of the day, we know that the one thing we feel the most confident about, of course, is the OEM destocking stopping, and at some point have to start rebuying. I\u2019d say the second thing we feel most confident about is China eventually coming back and coming back strong, but timing that exactly when that will happen is very difficult to do. And you tell me someone who knows who can pinpoint that answer. And then with regards to the overall rest of the markets, whether it\u2019s biopharma or whether it\u2019s academic, I think we\u2019re just being cautious in the view right now and kind of wait and see, because at the end of the day, the biotech funding headwinds, we think are mostly behind us. They haven\u2019t yet turned into tailwinds. I mean, I\u2019m not hearing or reading about major increases in biotech funding at this point. So I think it\u2019s this. And then same thing on the academic side where if anything, the news is about cutting NIH budgets not adding to them going forward. Now, I think we are well positioned to where there\u2019s mixed components within the academic funding where that could actually help us if the cuts happen in more of the call it the COVID-related areas and funding gets redirected towards oncology and neurology and things of that sort, where we\u2019re very well positioned, that could actually be an upside for us. But there\u2019s just a lot of dynamics and moving parts with the macro environment right now. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s, it\u2019d be wise to give any guidance \u2013 firm guidance beyond the next six months where those variables come into \u2013 will be hoping to come more clear as we close out this calendar year. Chuck Kummeth : Let me add a couple things too. And it\u2019s just work backwards from what you guys would love to hear. What would you, you\u2019d like to hear is that we\u2019re back to our 15% or better growth plan coming next quarter. We have a couple things happening in our favor starting in Q1. We start getting really good comps away from these horrible comps. So that\u2019s going to help. By the back end of the fiscal year and Jim is right. We\u2019ll be the only one talking about a full year from now. Everybody\u2019s talking about finishing this calendar year. And we\u2019ve got a beginning of a fiscal year starting now. And by the end of this fiscal year, I expect us to be in the run rates of double digit, if not mid-teens again. But how does that stack up for a year averages? It\u2019s hard to acknowledge right now with this quarter next quarter with especially with China. And China being 10% of our company and coming off 20%, 30% growth, that\u2019s two, three points of growth rate there for the company. So we got to factor that in. Maybe it\u2019s only another quarter of that. Maybe it\u2019s more. If it\u2019s more, it\u2019ll affect the number long term. So we\u2019re looking at all that. We don\u2019t officially give guidance. We give you a range for the coming year and you\u2019re smarter than we are and knowing our numbers up and down and backwards and forwards, you can see. I think our run rates can be where we expect it a year from now, maybe even higher because of our growth platforms seem to be accelerating, not decelerating to become more material. As you know on our five-year goal, we\u2019re two, three years into that now. We talk about these major growth that should be at 50%, they\u2019re running much, much higher than that. If they continue that, it\u2019s going to pick up some of the slack here on the core. But we\u2019re getting better and better in the core. And I think all we need is just the markets to stabilize and then we\u2019re back on track overall. But I do think we\u2019ve got a bit longer in the hangover here in the quarter at least that\u2019s the way to think about it. And we\u2019ll get \u2013 we\u2019re about the most transparent company you guys talk to that. And we\u2019ll tell you more next quarter when we see what happens with the one more this quarter. But at least we\u2019re going to have an easy comp this quarter and things will start improving for us dramatically. And we didn\u2019t have a bad quarter the way it was with everybody else being negative, negative, negative, we did post growth quite a bit comparatively, so in fact. So stay tuned. We\u2019ll know more within a quarter, but end of the year run rate should be pretty good we think. Dan Arias : Okay, fair enough. I can work with that. Appreciate that color there. While I have you, can we just maybe touch on GMP proteins. And just have you talk about what\u2019s driving the most growth there? Is it menu expansion? Is it larger orders from existing customers or is it\u2026 Chuck Kummeth : It\u2019s larger orders for existing customers and new customers. We\u2019ve expanded the customer list as you \u2013 as we mentioned. So that\u2019s one part component growth. The other is that customers that have been with us for two, three years, they\u2019re getting further along in their clinicals and they\u2019re asking for more. We talk about in the past of turning the plankton into minnows and minnows into tuna and tuna into whales. We\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019ve only got a handful of tuna and whales and we need, we\u2019ve got 400 customers. So just imagine a day in a couple, two, three, five years where we have dozens of whales. It\u2019s going to be amazing to see. Operator : The next question comes from Dan Leonard from Credit Suisse. Dan Leonard : Hi. Thank you. Could you talk a bit about your end market mix in China between academic and government, biopharma, any difference in trends you\u2019re seeing and what growth rate for China is assumed in the first half of the year in that mid-single digit view for the total company? Chuck Kummeth : Yes, sure. Well, China\u2019s a little different than most of our regions. We don\u2019t have a spell out pharma versus a biotech versus academic. It\u2019s all kind of government sponsored, well-funded, almost like academic. There are more and more institutions forming there, biosimilars is kind of where things are going in pharma there. And we\u2019d call them industrial. But by far it\u2019s really well-funded government, sponsored academic is most of the market for us. So it\u2019s research, research, research mainly, right? And it\u2019s very evenly split between our reagents and our instruments. And we had \u2013 we\u2019ve had a couple really boom years instruments there, as we\u2019ve talked about. So we\u2019re coming off a heavy comps there. And then with the COVID issues, their funding issues just dry things up for now. But as it comes back, it\u2019ll come back through the institutions. Now it\u2019s roughly about 180 institutions in both Beijing and Shanghai. And then you have modest numbers in some other than major cities, but nothing like the two major cities and that\u2019s what drives everything. I think we\u2019re in a very interesting time with China because they\u2019ve probably as a government, I think they\u2019ve never \u2013 they haven\u2019t seen this much consternation for many, many, many years. You\u2019ve got [indiscernible] in charge, but you\u2019ve got a lot of people that are not used to seeing negative GDP, a whole generation of people that have never seen this. You\u2019ve got real estate tipping over, you\u2019ve got a lot of issues, it\u2019s got to kind of work its way through. But underneath all of it, you\u2019ve got a high priority for the country, for the administration there on healthcare for their people. And that\u2019s got to begin with research. And at the end of the day, we\u2019re only a $100 million of revenue in China, so it could be $500 million or $1 billion. I\u2019d still say it\u2019s small compared to the opportunity. So we\u2019re getting back very strong. We have a lot of products for the size of our business and our company there. We have a lot of businesses, so there\u2019s plenty of levers to pull and plenty of interest across the board. Operator : The next question comes from Catherine Schulte with Baird. Catherine Schulte : Hey guys, thanks for the questions. I guess first, just any commentary on how Wilson Wolf is performing in this environment and any change in thoughts on when a full acquisition could occur? Chuck Kummeth : Yes, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re moving the game, the data for anything yet. They\u2019re not \u2013 they don\u2019t have heavy growth right now either, but they\u2019re flat to I\u2019d say mid-single digit growth last quarter or two. Given that the actual market there has imploded in funding us down. John, actually, this is a good sign. We\u2019re actually taking share. So he\u2019s actually getting more business than he thought compared to what everyone else is dealing with. So there \u2013 it\u2019s a good time. So we\u2019re going to get \u2013 we\u2019re going to be a lever off of this come next year. As you know, the profitability is way beyond our expectations, which allowed us to do the 20% trigger early. But we\u2019re probably on track for three to four years for the full acquisition, and that would be at 225 or so million dollars revenue or $136 million in EBITDA. Probably the EBITDA one will happen first, again, if things continue the way they are. We\u2019re working more and more with John [ph] on investments and diversifying things to do. But right now he is running at a very, very profitable model. And it\u2019s probably more than it should be for the \u2013probably should have more investment for growth and we\u2019re helping with that. [indiscernible] if you want to comment any more on that as well. Unidentified Company Representative : Yes, I think comment about taking share is great. I think the total number of customers has not declined. So they\u2019re not losing them. So as folks rationalize their spend, that\u2019s a good indicator. I think the other nice indicator having some insight into the product mix is that the uptake in development and kind of the developmental elements of their portfolio are really quite strong right now. And finally, we expect to be closing off some of our joint development projects on closed system, cytokine delivery and media and GMP. Media is in the platform too. So we\u2019ll start seeing more and more kind of synergies as that portfolio overlaps and we deliver a higher value proposition with our customers with that closed system. Chuck Kummeth : Since we\u2019re talking about growth and then in growth in China, other places, we didn\u2019t talk much about EPI, but I don\u2019t want to leave this call, I just maybe shout off the team that our Exosome platform is really killing it right now. We\u2019re getting record test days, virtually weekly. We crossed a 100,000 tests. We have a colorectal program that\u2019s making great progress. We have a multi analyte screening component tests coming that\u2019ll do many, many upstream pre-cancer type tests. And it\u2019s \u2013 it builds on top of methylation, so it\u2019ll be \u2013 go well above and beyond what other competitors in the field are doing with cell-free DNA. The future for Exosome I think is amazing. And you guys never focus on the great numbers more than where the damage is, but coming quarters, you\u2019re going to be want to talk more about Exosome as you see the numbers. We\u2019re investing more people and we are very close. The list now of tipping over the large private payers is getting very close. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to Chuck for any closing remarks. Chuck Kummeth : Well, I guess just thanks for everyone for attending the call. We always see the call count as we go, and it\u2019s a very big list. We know there\u2019s a lot of competition for your time out there. And we\u2019re glad there\u2019s all the interest in our company and we\u2019ll be back next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to David Clair, Bio-Techne's Vice President, Investor Relations. David Clair : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me this morning are Chuck Kummeth, Bio-Techne's Chief Executive Officer; Jim Hippel, Chief Financial Officer; and Kim Kelderman, Chief Operating Officer. Before we begin, let me briefly cover our safe harbor statement. Some of the comments made during this conference call may be considered forward-looking statements, including beliefs and expectations about the company's future results. The company's 10-K for fiscal year 2023 identifies certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements made during this call. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements because of any new information or future events or developments. The 10-K as well as the company's other SEC filings, are available on the company's website within its Investor Relations section. During the call, non-GAAP financial measures may be used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. Tables reconciling these measures to most comparable GAAP measures are available in the company's press release issued earlier this morning on the Bio-Techne Corporation website at www.bio-techne.com. Separately, we'll be participating in the Stifel, Stephens, Evercore and JPMorgan health care conferences in the coming months. We look forward to connecting with many of you at these upcoming events. I will now turn the call over to Chuck. Charles Kummeth : Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter conference call. The Bio-Techne team continues to execute in a challenging environment as we delivered 2% organic growth for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 despite several headwinds that are impacting the broader industry as well as Bio-Techne.  The sources of these headwinds have remained relatively consistent during recent quarters, including a soft biotech funding environment, inventory destocking from a handful of our OEM customers, as well as broad economic challenges in one of our historically highest growing geographies, China. While the primary culprits remain the same, the impact of the biopharma funding challenges in the U.S. as well as the evolving macroeconomic environment in China were higher than our original expectations for the quarter, albeit not as onerous as we saw with many of our peers. Despite these transitory challenges, our growth pillars remain intact and continue to perform well.  Specifically, our GMP proteins business, ExoDx prostate and our Protein Simple franchise all delivered impressive growth in the quarter. Our portfolio remains incredibly well positioned in several high-growth and unpenetrated end markets, and our team will continue to leverage our strategic playbook and strong financial position to gain share, enter adjacent markets, introduce innovative products and solutions and capitalize on the tremendous opportunity in front of the company. Before we dig deeper into the performance of the quarter, I'd like to personally congratulate Kim Kelderman on his recent appointment as Bio-Techne's incoming Chief Executive Officer effective February 1, 2024. In the meantime, I will continue to lead Bio-Techne's CEO, and work closely with Kim in his new role as Chief Operating Officer until Kim takes the reins as Bio-Techne's CEO in February. I will continue to support Kim in a senior advisory capacity prior to my retirement from the company and the Board on July 1, 2024. Kim has successfully led the Diagnostics and Genomics segment since joining the company in 2018. During Kim's leadership of this segment, the team gained significant market acceptance and traction with the ExoDx prostate test, the revenue of our ASV business totaled the segment portfolio was strengthened through the Asuragen and Lunaphore acquisitions and multiple new product introductions and partnerships position the business for future growth.  Prior to joining Bio-Techne, Kim ran multiple large businesses at ThermoFisher Scientific including most recently leading its genetic analysis business unit. Kim will be taking over an incredibly strong and talented team as well as a novel portfolio with leadership positions in some of the fastest-growing life science tools and diagnostic markets. Kim has been working with me since 2009, so I can assure everyone that I know he is more than ready for this tremendous opportunity, and he is the right person to take Bio-Techne on our 10-year forward journey to $5-plus billion revenue as a target as outlined recently at our Investor Day in New York. I'd like to also thank both Roll Gus and Jim Hippel, who created an incredibly difficult decision for the Board. Jim and extra thanks, as he, too, has been with me since 2009 and is the best financial partner I've ever worked with. Separately, I'd like to highlight Bio-Techne's latest Corporate Sustainability Report, which showcases the continued progress the company is making in its environmental, social and governance or ESG initiatives. The report is available in the corporate and social responsibility section of Bio-Techne's website. As you will see in the report, Biotech remains committed to our employees and the communities where we live and work. We are proud of the innovative culture we have built as well as our commitment to corporate governance and operational integrity. Driving durable, sustainable and responsible growth remains a cornerstone of our forward strategy. Now let's get into the details of the quarter, starting with an overview of our performance by geography and end market. Europe had a very strong quarter as the region grew mid-teens overall, including particularly strong performance from our biopharma end market. As a reminder, Europe was the region that was first experienced the effects of the post COVID slowdown, which contributed to a high single-digit decline in the comparable quarter of our last fiscal year.  That said, the European biopharma and academic end markets remain stable, and the new leadership team has maintained the positive momentum we experienced in the region over the last three quarters. In North America, we delivered as expected mid-single-digit growth with the performance in the region nearing the growth rate we experienced in the region last quarter and last fiscal year. It's worth noting that this is the region where we are noticing the most impact from the soft biotech funding environment as a subset of these customers continue to exhibit a disciplined approach to managing the businesses in the current environment. Now let's discuss the geography remains at the top of everyone's mind, China. This region declined low teens during the quarter and underperformed our original expectations with the business climate deteriorating as the quarter progressed. The funding challenges we highlighted in the last earnings call persisted in the quarter, as Chinese government funding for life sciences R&D at hospitals and academic institutions is significantly lower than last year. Given the challenging macroeconomic conditions in China, it remains very difficult to ascertain when R&D funding will stabilize and step back up again. Additionally, private equity and VC funding activity has slowed in the geography, which is creating more cautious near-term spending patterns for cash-dependent biopharma companies in the region. We view the temporary pause in China's growth trajectory as transitory as the government remains focused on modernizing health care in both large metropolitan areas and rural communities. Our portfolio remains extremely well positioned in this geography as our proteomics research reagents and analytical tools and increasingly our spatial biology solutions are the tools researchers rely on to advance scientific discoveries and improve health care. We are as bullish as we have ever been on our long-term opportunities in China, but acknowledge that these headwinds will likely linger in the near term before improving. Now I'll highlight the growth pillars that will propel our future, starting with those within the Protein Sciences segment, where organic growth was 2% in the current quarter. During the quarter, we continued to advance our portfolio of cell and gene therapy initiatives as our portfolio of proteomics reagents and workflow solutions continue to enable our customers to further their therapeutic development work and make continued progress towards the commercialization of these next-generation therapies. Collectively, our portfolio of cell and gene therapy products and services increased over 25% in the quarter. GMP proteins remains the cornerstone of our cell therapy offering and Bio-Techne continues to benefit from having the broadest menu available, including several proteins that are unique to Bio-Techne. This broad offering is a critical selling point for customers working across the cell therapy spectrum especially in regenerative medicine cell therapies as these tend to require not only several different proteins in the workflow, but also require complex proteins that are very difficult to manufacture, playing right into one of biotech strong suits. Overall, our portfolio of GMP proteins grew nearly 40% in the quarter. We also continue to gain traction with our portfolio of GMP small molecules. Recall that these small molecules are key components in the route programming, self-renewal, storage and differentiation processes that are key to regenerative medicine workflows. This business grew almost 20% in the quarter and is on its way to becoming a significant contributor to our overall cell and gene therapy business. We are in the process of expanding our G&P portfolio to include additional media formulations, gene edit engineering capabilities and antibodies, positioning Bio-Techne to remain a leader in this rapidly growing industry. Additionally, work continues to finalize our aseptic immune cell therapy manufacturing solution, which pairs our GMP proteins, GMP Media and Wilson Wolf G-Rex in a closed sterile manufacturing solution. Moving on to our ProteinSimple branded portfolio or proteomic analytical tools. Here, the team delivered 9% organic growth. It's worth noting that excluding China, the portfolio grew an even more impressive 18%, including over 35% growth in Europe. Consumable pull-through from our growing installed base remains very strong and continues to grow on a per instrument basis, reflecting the high value and productivity gains that these instruments deliver to our biopharma and academic customers.  The ProteinSimple performance was led by our Simple Plex automated multiplexing ELISA instrument branded as Ella, who is expanding menu of validated assays, including 7 launches in Q1 and a growing installed base is driving consumable pull-through on the platform. We've recently received ISO 1345 certification of our Wallingford, Connecticut facility quality management system, demonstrating our commitment to producing products for clinical applications. With this important certification in hand, we are now ready to pursue clinical diagnostic opportunities on Ella, opening up a large potential market for this fast, highly sensitive and easy-to-use multiplexing immunoassay instruments. Momentum continued in our Biologics business as we experienced continued uptake of our Maurice Flex instrument and strong demand for consumables. As a reminder, Maurice Flex's protein charge variant fractionation capabilities position this next-gen instrument is an easy-to-use replacement for legacy mass spectrometry fractionation, methods, including ion exchange chromatography.  This new application enters Maurice into a new $300 million market approximately doubling the addressable market opportunity for the instrument. The capabilities of our legacy Maurice instrument as well as the next-gen Maurice Flex were recently highlighted by scientists from top pharmaceutical companies at the recent CE Farm conference, including a presentation from Pfizer scientists on Maurice Flex's capabilities for peak identification of AAV capsid proteins through fractionation. I would note that there are several other Maurice Flex collaborations in progress with additional top-tier life science companies. Our fully automated Western blot solution branded as Simple Western also continued to increase its market share this quarter. The platform's ability to reduce the 2-day long manual and messy western blotting process into a 3-hour push button, highly reproducible solution continues to drive demand within our biopharma and academic customer bases.  We are also seeing robust adoption of Simple Western in cell and gene therapy applications, with the system increasingly being utilized to measure protein expression potency, empty versus full capsid ratio, and for process impurity detection. Revenue from cell and gene therapy applications in Simple Western increased over 25% in the quarter and now account for almost a quarter of the associated product right of revenue. Next, I'll highlight the growth pillars within our Diagnostics and Genomics segment, where organic revenue growth was flat in the current quarter compared to prior year. Mostly due to the timing of large OEM orders within our diagnostics reagents business as well as large lab orders for genetic tests within our molecular diagnostic business.  I'll start with our ExoDx prostate test, where we once again drove significant growth in test volume as the valuable information on whether a man with an indeterminate PSA score should proceed with an invasive and potentially dangerous prostate biopsy continues to resonate with both patients and physicians. ExoDx prostate volume increased nearly 50% compared to prior quarter, while year quarter, while revenue increased in the upper teens. Adjusting for our prior year cash to accrual adjustment, year-over-year revenue growth was approximately in line with our test volume growth. As we highlighted during our recent Investor Day, applications for our exosome-based diagnostic platform are much broader than our current ExoDx prostate test. Our pipeline includes single gene mutation test for monitoring several different cancers, a saliva-based test for the diagnosis of children syndrome a next-generation prostate cancer rule in test as well as a colorectal cancer screening test designed for early detection of both colorectal cancer and precancerous polyps. We look forward to sharing additional data on this exciting pipeline in coming quarters. Now let's discuss our spatial biology business, which includes our ACD-branded catalog of over 47,000 unique probes as well as the Luna for branded spatial biology instrument assay and software portfolio. Our spatial biology business increased upper single digits organically for the quarter as our broad portfolio of multi-omic assays continue to play an important role in advancing gene therapy, neuroscience and cancer research.  Within the portfolio, we are experiencing continued momentum in base scope, which enables the detection of target sequences down to one nucleotide differences and microRNA scope for the visualization of microRNA and other nucleic acid targets. BaseScope and micro RNA scope increased almost 20% and 50%, respectively, and are experiencing increasing acceptance and traction in gene therapy applications. Integration efforts of our latest acquisition, Lunaphore, are off to a great start and the team is embracing their new home under the biotech umbrella. As a reminder, Lunaphore for is currently commercializing its common instrument, a fully automated, high-throughput Hyperflex platform that does not require the use of conjugated primary antibodies. [indiscernible] high value proposition is resonating with the translational research community, which is driving significant interest and rapid growth in its installed base.  We continue to make progress developing the first fully automated spatial and multiomic workflow that will leverage Lunaphore's common instruments, Inspire antibody panels as well as ACD's RNAscope Hipple technology to enable protein and RNA detection and visualization on a single slide. In summary, the Bio-Techne team continues to execute our strategic growth plan in this challenging environment. As we look at our relative performance to many of the life science companies that have reported so far this quarter, I'm especially proud of our team's execution and have even more confidence in the perseverance of our growth platforms.  As we highlighted during our recent Investor Day, our portfolio of proteomic research reagents, cell and gene therapy workflow solutions, analytical tools, spatial biology products and liquid biopsy diagnostics are aimed squarely at a $27 billion vessel market with amazing long-term growth prospects. Initiatives to cure cancer, neurodegenerative and other diseases, along with understanding how these diseases develop and evolve, we remain a social priority for the foreseeable future, and Bio-Techne's portfolio will continue to play a critical role in these efforts. I am looking forward to when the transitory headwinds facing our industry subside, allowing the growth of our high-value tools to once again shine through. With that, I'll turn it over to Jim. James Hippel : Thanks, Chuck. I'll start with some additional detail on our Q1 financial performance, then give some thoughts on the financial outlook. Starting with the overall first quarter financial performance. Adjusted EPS was $0.41 compared to $0.45 in the prior year quarter, a decrease of 9% over last year. Foreign exchange had a had an immaterial impact on EPS in the quarter. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.31 compared to $0.55 in the prior year. Q1 revenue was $276.9 million, an increase of 2% year-over-year on an organic basis and 3% on a reported basis. Foreign exchange translation had an immaterial impact, while acquisitions contributed 1% to reported growth. Moving on to our organic growth by region and end market in Q1. North America grew mid-single digits. Europe increased mid-teens, and China declined low teens in the quarter. As Chuck previously mentioned, the soft biotech funding environment remained a drag on our North American business, while Europe saw strong growth but also had a less difficult comp as the region declined high single digits in the comparable quarter last year. For China, the funding environment continued to impact the region. Our long-term enthusiasm on China remains fully intact. Health care remains a top priority for the government and our proteomic reagents, analytical tools and spatial biology solutions will play a critical role advancing health care in this country.  That said, the timing of this recovery remains incrementally more challenging to call at this point. Meanwhile, APAC outside of China increased low single digits overall, with government funding constraints in Japan and South Korea. By end market in Q1, both biopharma and academia excluding China, grew upper single digits. However, the biopharma growth was much larger in Europe given the less difficult comps. Below revenue on the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin was 71.3% in the quarter compared to 70.9% in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by productivity gains and foreign exchange partially offset by the impact of the Lunaphore acquisition.  Adjusted SG&A in Q1 was 31.3% of revenue compared to 27.3% in the prior year, while R&D expense in Q1 was 8.7% of revenue compared to 8.9% in the prior year. The increase in SG&A was driven primarily by the Lunaphore acquisition and, to a lesser extent, strategic investments to position the business for future growth. The price increases implemented during the first half of fiscal year '23 continue to offset the dollar impact of inflation to operating income with pricing also largely offsetting the inflationary impact in our operating margin in Q1. Adjusted operating margin for Q1 was 31.4%, a decrease of 340 basis points from the prior year period. Excluding the Lunaphore acquisition, which closed at the beginning of Q1, adjusted operating margin was 100 basis points lower than the prior year due to strategic investments, which was partially offset by diligent cost management. Looking at our numbers below operating income. Net interest expense in Q1 was $3.9 million, increasing $1 million compared to the prior year period due to higher debt levels, partially offset by higher interest income and cash deposits. Our bank debt on the balance sheet as of the end of Q1 stood at $440 million, an increase of $90 million compared to last quarter, reflecting the Lunaphore acquisition, which was partially funded by debt and cash on hand. Other adjusted nonoperating income was $1.6 million in the quarter, an increase of $0.4 million compared to prior year, primarily reflecting our 20% share of Wilson Wolf's adjusted net income partially offset by the foreign exchange impact related to our cash pooling arrangements. Moving further down the P&L, our adjusted effective tax rate in Q1 was 22%, a sequential increase from our Q4 tax rate due to international mix. Turning to cash flow and return of capital. $59.4 million of cash was generated from operations in the quarter, and our net investment in capital expenditures was $13.6 million. Also during Q1, we returned capital to shareholders by way of $12.7 million in dividends. We finished the quarter with 161.9 million average diluted shares outstanding. Our balance sheet finished Q1 in a strong position with $148.7 million in cash, and our total leverage ratio remained below 1x EBITDA. Going forward, M&A remains a top priority for capital allocation. Before we get into the segment results, I'd like to quantify some of the impacts from headwinds we experienced in the quarter compared to our initial expectations for organic growth. A more challenging China funding and macro environment than expected represented an additional approximately 200 basis points headwind, while order timing in our Diagnostics and Genomics segment was another unanticipated headwind of approximately 100 basis points. The more cautious spending from our biotech customers, which we primarily experienced in the U.S. is more difficult to quantify that impacted the business none the less, especially in the last couple of weeks of the quarter. Now I'll discuss the performance of our reporting segments, starting with Protein Sciences. Q1 reported sales were $204.7 million, with both reported and organic revenue increasing 2% compared to the same period last year. As a reminder, it is our Protein Sciences segment that has the most exposure to the China geographic region as well as to the biotech end market. Operating margin for the Protein Sciences segment was 43.2%, and an increase of 20 basis points compared to the prior year quarter as productivity gains and cost management more than offset the impact from strategic investments. Turning to the Diagnostics and Genomics segment. Q1 reported sales were $72.8 million, with reported growth increasing 4% compared to the same quarter last year. Organic revenue growth for the segment was flat with acquisitions having a 3% impact and foreign exchange having a favorable impact of 1%. As Chuck previously mentioned, organic growth was negatively impacted by the timing of certain OEM and lab orders for our diagnostic controls and genetic testing products. However, our Exosome Diagnostics business remained very strong in the quarter as our fortified marketing message, strong clinical data and the updated Medicare LCD drove both test volume and revenue growth. Also, our spatial biology business delivered upper single-digit growth in the quarter with continued growth in RNA scope and strong performances in our BaseScope and microRNA product lines. We are very pleased with the traction Lunaphore is having with its comment launch, as Chuck highlighted initial integration efforts are progressing well. While Lunaphore will not be in our organic growth rates for the year, they are executing well on their plan to grow more than 100% for the fiscal year. We continue to expect Lunaphore to contribute at least 1.5% to our overall company's reported growth for fiscal '24. Moving on to the Diagnostics and Genomics segment operating margin at 0.7%, the segment's operating margin decreased compared to prior year's 12.4%, due primarily to the impact of the Lunaphore acquisition, and to a lesser extent, strategic growth investments as well as unfavorable product mix. Before we get to Q&A, I'd like to provide some color on our current thoughts regarding the near-term outlook. As many of our life science tools peers have already mentioned, the macro environment in China continues to weaken, and the biopharma end market is softening, especially in the U.S. While we expect these headwinds to negatively impact our growth in the protein scientist segment relative to Q1, we also anticipate the timing of OEM and lab orders within our Diagnostics and Genomics segment to be accretive to growth relative to Q1. Net-net, we are forecasting overall company organic growth to be about flat in Q2. Beyond Q2, the macro environment is dynamic to provide guidance with any sort of results. While the headwinds of OEM destocking should be behind us in the second half of fiscal year '24, it appears right now that a China and biopharma recovery will not be tailwind as we once believed.  Whatever the macro environment throws at us in the near term, our excellent management team and dedicated employees will continue to drive productivity to protect the bottom line, all while selectively investing in the growth pillars that will accelerate our overall company's growth rate when the market headwinds decide and turn back into tailwinds, and the winds will turn.  As Chuck said, society's priority to cure disease is inevitable and endless. Bio-Techne is ready now and will be even more so in the future to help our customers fulfill the societal need. That concludes my prepared comments and with that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Puneet Souda with SVB Securities. Please proceed with your question. Puneet Souda : Yeah, hey guys, Puneet here from Leerink. So just, Chuck, could you maybe just help us clarify, I know a lot of uncertainties right now with China funding and just overall macro. But should we expect a sequential recovery and growth in the second half of this fiscal year?  I know you said flat for the next quarter. but should we expect that to continue to step up from that? And what does that mean in terms of the overall growth for the full fiscal year, if Jim could elaborate on that, that would be super helpful? Charles Kummeth : Sure, Puneet. So we just came back from China, and we are pretty much saying what everyone else is saying on their call this past week or -- this quarter was disappointing. China definitely is created, they're out of money. We did talk about funding returning starting next quarter -- last quarter -- and there are some glimmers of that, but not enough to be material. So this next quarter is more of the same. The second half, we're hopeful, but there isn't anything -- any real evidence right now that there's that there's going to be any kind of a V recovery or a recovery at all, to be honest. But the team is very hopeful. There's energy there. Streets are full. The economy looks great at a consumer commercial level. But I think in terms of government funding for this segment, I think, is right now, we're kind of a wait and see.  Now with a bunch of very important KOLs, and they all say the same thing that there's a lot of hope and there's a lot of expectations they don't doubt it's coming, but the government is not roll forward on their planning, obviously. So we're all kind of wait and see. But other segments there look better. It's just a downtime for biotech, and we're going to we've got to grind through it, I guess. James Hippel : And Puneet, I'll just add, I mean, as Chuck alluded to, there's no sign right now any kind of V or even new shape recovery in this fiscal year. So we're just playing it fairly conservative. The China situation is, as Chuck outlined, the other thing dynamic we saw was the U.S. market starts to soften in the last couple of weeks of the quarter and that has continued into October. So that's reflected in our kind of flattish guidance here for Q2, but what's unknown is whether that trend continues beyond that or whether it stabilizes. So hence, we're not commenting on the back half of fiscal year '24 at this point. Charles Kummeth : I do want to also emphasize that you take out China, we had a not too bad a quarter, mid- to high single-digit growth, near 20% growth or instruments. All our growth platform is growing -- actually right on plan more or less. They just aren't big enough to cover the company right now. But -- so it won't be too much longer. This kind of stuff won't matter that much. And I do believe in a couple of quarters, China will be -- start becoming a better story. But right now, for 1 more quarter, at least, we're all in a wait and see. So. Puneet Souda : Okay. That's helpful. Then could you elaborate a bit more on sort of what you're seeing on the Wilson Wolf side of the business, the contribution you were expecting here for us cell and gene therapy? And how much, if any, that could contribute to sort of the second half growth here in the fiscal second half? And then I mean it seems like a number of unexpected pressures showed up in Diagnostics and Genomics segment. Maybe just talk to us a little bit about sort of the timing and recovery in that as well? Charles Kummeth : Okay. I'll mention Wilson Wolf, and I'll let Kim discuss TGS. Wilson Wolf is kind of more of the same, very flattish. We've not lost any customers. We're kind of grinding forward with them, too. They've got 800-plus customers. We've got 400 overall with our protein side, but they are kind of the de facto standard out there in bioreactors. And John has been focusing a lot on scale ready, the sister business that will also carry our workflow through.  That's going extremely well. We have just launched or new versions of our protein to be working towards a sterile type of a bioreactor module, I guess, a bundle. So everything is kind of going okay there. We're just kind of waiting for the overall uptick, but we're not losing ground. It's just kind of treading water right now. And which means they're still making lots of revenue, a meager 75% operating income and pushing forward.  So they're using all that income to keep investing and driving faster. So -- and then Kim wants to follow up. Kim Kelderman : Yes, Puneet, thanks for the question. So obviously, larger companies have been optimizing their inventories and for us, that mainly impacted the DRD organization as they mainly sell into the large IVD companies. It also affected MDD a little bit, specifically in the genetic testing portfolio, which is the legacy surgeon.  They sell into the laboratory space and the larger laboratory space and of course, these laboratories also want to optimize their inventories, specifically going into the end of the calendar year. But we see those as temporal, and we think that we're at the back end of the destocking phase. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Dan Arias with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Daniel Arias : Hi guys, thanks for the question. Chuck, Simple Western growth stepped up nicely this quarter, particularly given the issue environment that we're in. What do you think drove that? And do you see that as sustainable what do you think a reasonable growth rate for that portion of the portfolio might be this year? Charles Kummeth : No, that's a great question. I think we're kind of back to original type thinking on Simple Western. I think we had roughly 9% growth or something like that with it. Consumables was even higher, much higher we're knocking on the door of 3,000 instruments out there, which is still under 20% penetration just for the Western blot application alone.  And there's a bunch of new applications coming using the instruments, including the diagnostic-related applications. So we're super bullish on our Simple Western platform. It's -- we're in early innings yet. So I still think the long-term growth rate for this talk like a decade is like a 15% CAGR for a decade. It's going to go up and down. I think last year, we're still fighting comps. And last year, we had 50% type growth last couple of years. So we're still kind of working through that. And we're still showing growth right now, strong growth and double-digit growth in consumables.  So long term, I think it's going to bounce around 10% to 30%, but it's going to be an average of 15%, I think. And this is the only game in town where this type of technology. We've got strong IP. No one's ever been able to get close to it. It's automated Westerns, which is a nightmare for people. So it's nothing but a great future. James Hippel : Yes, Dan, I'll just add to that. As Chuck just ended with, I think it speaks to the productivity nature of the instrument. We've been saying all along, it's an amazing productivity tool. And in this time, as tightening budgets and concerns about funding should help. That's what's driving the consumable growth there. So it truly is the productivity tool. We've been saying it all along. Daniel Arias : Yes. Okay. And then maybe just on ACD, 9% growth, I think you said during the quarter. Do you think that can get back up into the double-digit range? And then along those lines, can you just touch on where you are now just in terms of the need for additional commercial scale up there?  And then whether you think usage in the clinical translational setting is a reasonable expectation in one of the things that you need in order to get back up into that 2-digit number? Kim Kelderman : Hey Dan, it's Kim. Thanks for the question. Absolutely. I think it was mainly Apex slowing us down a little bit this quarter. By fixing just that or normalizing, we will be back in the double digits. That's the entitlement for not only the end markets but also our unique solution with the RNA scope portfolio of products.  Think about Lunaphore is going to keep this business a boost as well, right? And we will definitely have more pull-through on the Lunaphore boxes, to COMET specifically. And then last but not least, our clinical business has been outpacing the overall product portfolio already and it's becoming more than 10% of our revenues portion. So I think the undoubtedly answer is, yes, it will be back in double digits. Daniel Arias : Okay. Just really quickly, Kim, is the percentage of revenues from -- in China for your spatial business similar to the overall corporate average? Kim Kelderman : No, it's much lower. Daniel Arias : Okay, thank you. Kim Kelderman : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jacob Johnson with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good morning. This is Hannah on for Jacob. Thanks for taking my questions. If the macro remains a headwind well into 2024, how does this impact your view on organic investment? Will you try to manage profitability? Or does this change your approach to organic investment? Charles Kummeth : Yes. Jim can cover this. James Hippel : Yes. The short answer is no. I mean we are putting in productivity measures in place. We have been anticipating this throughout the quarter, and we continue to do that. We are, of course, pacing our investments accordingly. But our intention is to hold the margin guidance that we gave out earlier in the year. and manage our productivity to that while still investing in our growth platforms.  So we're -- that's what we're paid to do is manage the support of the business given the current environment while still investing for the future, and that's what we intend to do. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks. And then can you talk about the outlook in proteins and antibodies for the remainder of the year? Do you expect to end the bulk orders to be coming back? Charles Kummeth : Yes, I'll cover that. I just had a meeting yesterday with the team and bulks are on the rise. So that's a very good early indicator that OEM business be returning. Destocking, as Jim said, it's kind of largely behind us. We're starting to see discussion on orders now in some very large orders. So I think we're turning the corner on that. I think our run rate business is hopefully kind of bottomed here.  We'll start positioning that out. I mean we had probably the worst quarter and 10 years of Fisher this last quarter, and we see that kind of flattening as well. I mean they talked about it on their call as well, and where that -- the segment that lives and it couldn't have been very great. But these labs are running out of stuff. They've got to start buying again, and we're starting to see the first inklings of that.  So we think run rate will start improving some. And I think our retail overall will start improving. Remember now, our that's not a majority of our revenue. So it takes all these things together to give us in the double-digit growth. But they all matter. And this part here, I'm kind of bullish looking forward finally. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Patrick Donnelly : Hey guys, thanks for taking the questions. Maybe first just on the biopharma performance in the quarter. Can you just talk about what you saw across the customer set and how things progress throughout the quarter, kind of the linear performance?  And then maybe just disaggregate between the trends, smaller biotech versus mid and large pharma, a few peers suggest that things may be deteriorated as the quarter went? So curious what you guys saw? Charles Kummeth : Yeah. Well, overall for the company, our academic versus biopharma is largely even about the same, but it was lopsided. So it was much stronger for biopharma in Europe okay, than it was in U.S., U.S. was low almost mid-single-digit growth. So that's a much poorer performance than usual for us in the U.S. As Jim said, most of our pain was in the U.S. and then China and it was on the biopharma side. All in, without China, we actually didn't do too bad because academic was not too bad. I mean, probably better than many quarters in the past quarter, to be honest. So we're waiting on that biopharma to come back. And of course, as you mentioned, biotech is part of that biopharma and biotech is still soft out there. The funding environment for biotech, small to medium companies going after their second or third round or trying to get that next way the clinical is going or rejuvenate the clinicals they're in, it's just softer. They're all being very careful because money is tight. It's going to change, but it's going to be a quarter or 2, I think on that part of biopharma. Pharma is just being conservative because they're just being conservative because they just see the wins, the way they're looking, and that can turn on a dime. I'll give you some evidence why that can be very, very quick to move. We actually had a very good quarter on our immunoassay, ELISA, dual sets, high single-digit growth. and that was not the case a quarter or 2 ago.  So that could be early evidence of things starting to flip because that's mostly farmer driving most of that business. So ELISA is still more or less a standard for driving testing and clinicals. So. Patrick Donnelly : Okay. That's helpful, Chuck. Thanks. And then maybe just a follow-up on China. I guess what do you guys need to see to get a little more constructive in that market? Obviously, the prior guide, you're talking maybe a little bit about a second half recovery curious what you're baking in at this point in terms of the year for China and if there's any visibility into a level of improvement? Thank you, guys. Charles Kummeth : Yeah. We went how many -- how many quarters in a row a 25% growth or so. So we're definitely in a lull right now. This is a negative teens quarter coming off of a high teens quarter growth last quarter. But going forward, it's going to be more of the same. I think flattish would be hopeful the next quarter or 2, to be honest. So the second half, our Q4, who knows? I mean it wouldn't take -- we're not that big in China, right, overall.  So it wouldn't take that much or that many orders or rejuvenation in any area to actually get back into some growth. But we'll just have to wait and see. We're just going to be cautious and not overpromise. There's not a lot of evidence, but the attitude is very high. Our team is at full strength. We have 0 attrition. Talked to a lot of customers personally here a couple of weeks ago, and actually, they're fairly bullish as well. We're just waiting for the government to start loosening up here with what they usually do in April, and they still haven't done it. But once they do, people start talking favorably again about China. And you got to believe, and we've talked to a lot of people, health care is still number 1 is a priority for China. It looks great. You're in the middle of Shanghai. You don't have to go too far outside the city and you start seeing why the government is still concerned about health care. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Catherine Schulte with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Thomas Peterson : Yeah, hi everyone. This is Tom on for Catherine. Wanted to maybe dig into Europe a little bit. Obviously, had a really strong quarter from an organic growth standpoint. I understand that there are some comp dynamics within that number, but kind of flag the region as perhaps a leading indicator of some of the softness. So curious to the kind of what were the drivers here? And if you have anything to flag from a leading indicator standpoint within Europe? Charles Kummeth : Sure. Well, first, as you mentioned, the comps were quite easy. So that helped a lot. But 15% organic growth is 15% organic growth. It's a great quarter to have that. We're not talking about a negative Europe right now. So we're 2 or three quarters into a real recovery for us in Europe. That's also part of the story.  We have a new management team in place. They have done some reorganization a couple of quarters ago. And quite frankly, it's working. We're getting more synergies. We're getting more cross-selling. We're nearly at full strength. We've invested more salespeople as an example, in the Nordic regions.  The new leader is German. Germany should be our biggest subsidiary in Europe and if not, and be correcting that. There's already been great evidence that we're going to have a strong future, I think, in Germany with him at the helm. And I guess wait and see. But I'm -- right now, I'm not focused too much on Europe for a change. Things are going pretty well. Thomas Peterson : Great. That's helpful. And then clearly, we talked about a number of headwinds throughout the space that are popping up throughout your reports. But with that in mind, I was wondering if you had any comments on sort of your thoughts around the M&A landscape? I mean what does the funnel look like here? Is there any more willingness among private maybe enter those conversations kind of given where we are from a macro perspective? Charles Kummeth : Yeah. Well, it's -- we've never been busier to be honest. It's -- I said all year, it's going to be a great year in M&A, we've landed Lunaphore. I just came back from Aldo where I'm on the Board, and I never received more confidence about a deal in my entire tenure here is this Lunaphore deal. It seems like everybody wanted to. So it's going to be a marvelous platform and it has lots of applications and did we mention the growth year-on-year, 170%. This thing is it's exploding. It's going to be a wonderful asset and Kim personally close that deal. We've been involved in others. I mean we just saw Link. We were there. We know a lot about Olink. We sell them a lot of products. And they're a good partner, and we look forward to continuing our partnership on many fronts with Thermo Fisher with Olink as well.  So it's been a great relationship with Thermo and we don't see any problems there, but we'd sure like to pick up a few more assets like that. There are lots of them out there. You mentioned private. This is definitely the year to be looking at smaller deals, private deals, deals in the core even that funding is tight, and we're seeing multiples kind of picking up. The price takes these latest deals have been pretty good, and that gives hope for owners and they pick up the phone. So I'm still expecting a pretty good coming year here for M&A. We have lots of purchasing power for our size, and we'll try to use it and I mean I'll be gone soon, but I'm sure Jim and Kim and the team here will continue the mission on that. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Matt Larew with William Blair. Please proceed with your question. Matthew Larew : Chuck, something you -- as Jim called it out in his comments was the headwind around biotech funding. And I think you said that hurt especially in the last couple of weeks of the quarter. And so given that Bio-Techne has been under pressure for some time. Just curious if there was anything that you picked up on in the last couple of weeks or I've noticed a sense on that front? James Hippel : Yes. I mean, we've been saying how biotech was relatively stable for us after its initial kind of drop in the first part of fiscal year '23. And stabilization was pretty consistent up until like I said the last couple of weeks. We saw the run rates drop off. We saw some larger deals not close, and that kind of continued here in October.  I don't have a good answer as to why that's the case, except to say that all of our peers are pretty much saying the same thing. So it appears like as we get into the year-end here, there's another round of belt tightening going on across biopharma, especially in biotech. There's some optimism that it's an end of the year belt piping exercise and once we get into calendar year '24, but new budgets get approved at the business level that we'll start to see the pickup in activity. But again, we're a little bit too early to tell at this point. Matthew Larew : Okay. And then sort of aggregating your comments, it sounds like we should be thinking about China continuing down in this low teens as we're modeling out, but obviously, growth in the business ex China, and that's fair to say, even though you're not providing guidance? James Hippel : That is fair to say, and that's consistent with Q1. I think one of the biggest drivers, too, in terms of the about the second half and so forth in diagnostics and genomics. So our growth would have been better this quarter if there weren't for those timing issues that Kim talked about and so we do see a nice snapback in the diagnostics genomics submit going forward.  And to reiterate what I said earlier, in the near term, Protein Sciences can still be very challenged by China. China is going to get worse before it gets better. The view from our teams out in China, we just visited is that Q2 is hopefully the bottom. The question is does it -- is it a dead count bounce for a while? Or is the funding come back in the early part of calendar year '24. That remains to be seen. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alex Nowak with Craig-Hallum. Please proceed with your question. Alexander Nowak : Okay. Great, good morning, everyone. Kim, I think we're all very excited to work with you in the CEO position. But maybe just expand maybe the whole team here because you expand on the internal search process in that the board considered Will and Jim as well what ultimately led to the decision here? Charles Kummeth : Well, I can't speak for the Board, but we did announce it's very early. I went through that quite carefully. I mean it's going on 1.5 years ago. I think it was very clear why we announced. One, which is uncommon was to give enough time to be very thoughtful in the process, look at leading executives that might have non-competes to work through. I think the Board went through an extensive exhaustive list doing their fiduciary duty, I do know that there was more than a half a dozen external on the list at 1 point. And -- but I think to say more or less what Bob had said at a meeting recently was there just didn't seem to be that big a difference in what they thought the experience levels and the abilities of the externals versus our three top notch internal candidates, which I spent the last decade and, in some cases, longer from 2 different companies. And so why take the risk externally with their point of view.  And I do think it was a tough decision, as I mentioned, and Kim's thrilled. Jim and Will, I'm sure, are happy for Kim, but they're still here, and we're -- we've been a good team with very low politics for many years together. And both here and Thermo Fisher, where we all came from, and I see no reason why it won't continue. We've got a lot of work to do. Our stock is down like everybody else's in the industry, and so there's a lot of potential upside. We see a path to a $5 billion revenue company in 10 years. And my guess is the stock will be much higher than. So they'll probably stick around. Alexander Nowak : Makes total sense. And Kim, there's always been a biotech news that this is a unique combination of biotech products and then call it Diagnostics and Genomics. Would you anticipate with this move here that Bio-Techne is a little bit more diagnostics focus after the transition? Or are you very focused on keeping this truly well-defined high-growth areas? Kim Kelderman : Absolutely. So the latter, there's no internal bias to either one. I think we have defined our core growth platforms, our true growth platforms, our vertical markets that we're focused on, and I'm going to love all of them equally. And on top of that, some of them have higher potential than others, and we're going to invest in the true growth platforms, and that's going to be the best way for the company as well as for the shareholders. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Knight with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question. Paul Knight : Yeah. Thanks very much. Chuck, you're a long-time China expert. When you look at the funding, do you -- what portion is the government funding and what portion is this biotech private sector demand that, I guess, developed in the last 5 years? So what's kind of the proportion of this kind of funding discussion you're seeing or your perspective would be super interesting? Charles Kummeth : It's a great question, and it's probably a very difficult answer to really answer definitively. You're absolutely right in the last 5 years or so, it's been definitely a drift away from solely relying on government funding and the government plans and the biotech sector has definitely grown in China. And there have been some companies that have come and become real companies like BGI to come to mind that have been very successful.  I think private equity, VC money has grown. I think you've got a lot of Chinese American people that are Chinese and decent have gone home and taken with them business principles and business models from America, and it's gone quite well. We have some great friends there. We know some -- there have been some great track records of some Chinese firms that have been doing venture and done quite well. The percentage, I think, though, is hard to difficult at. I think we still -- we're going more and more direct all the time, all of us there, but we still mainly fulfill through just master distributors in China. And so it's a little bit hard to understand where it already is coming from. There's a run rate component as well and I think that is largely driven by institutions, which are largely government funded.  We have some growing OEM opportunities as well, especially in our DRD segment and there are companies like mine Array and others that have been around a long time and very successful in growing double digit that have taken a bigger and bigger piece of our business and going direct with us. But -- so the government portion is definitely shrinking, but it's still such a major portion of that is going to drive the overall size of the business and the overall, call it, the pulse of the economy over there. James Hippel : Paul, I would add, if I could, that perhaps unlike the U.S., the government funding in China has more indirect impact on VC funding than it does in the U.S. I think VC fund in the U.S. is irrespective of what NIH funding does. But in China, the VC funding often will follow or accentuate what the government does. So that's why following the government money really the lead, we believe on -- with the direction of where our space is going there. Paul Knight : Yes. That follow-up on that then to me would be it does appear that the government clearly is behind hospitals and core health care, some numbers across the industry show improvement there. But -- do you think the government still is behind fundamentally picking up R&D to create that biotech sector? So yes, that would be my last follow-up. Thanks. Charles Kummeth : I think they're very bullish on that. I think that's something they definitely want. They -- China wants to be in a leadership position as best they can in biotech in life sciences and not being a predicament like they are in semiconductor, for sure. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Justin Bowers with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Justin Bowers : Hi, good morning, everyone. So just sticking with the topic du jour, where -- you talked about next quarter being potentially the trough for China. And somewhat of a philosophical question. But if we exclude Hope and return to government funding and just think about the infrastructure that's in place now and what's needed to sustain the business. Is 2Q sort of like a good reflection of the run rate?  And just taking a step back, I mean, you guys are outperforming peers a little bit in that market. Some are down 30%, 40%, 50%, right? And there's only so many quarters you can have those sorts of drawdowns before you start cutting into the bone. So just any thoughts on that would... Charles Kummeth : Yes, it's a good question. the institutions there, a good comment from our leader in APAC this week, and he said, \"Well, -- they're not really in the cutting people. They're just sitting around playing Mahjong waiting for money to come in.\" So -- but the teams are there. And -- but you're right, they've got to get work done, and they are labs and they've got run rate we need. And I think the -- it's about growth, it's about future growth, it's about money for new programs, but there is a certain level of keep the lights on funding happening. So it's shrinking, but it's not gone away.  So I mean got to put it in perspective there, I think. I think other companies talked with that, too. There's -- we had 17% growth last quarter. In this quarter, we were down mid-teens. Maybe it will be end up being flat, but it isn't like there's no money, no funding. I mean people aren't working or going to work, they're going to work, and they're doing work, but there isn't funding for new programs right now. So everything is kind of at a standstill waiting on that. So that's really the tone going forward. Don't know of any real layoffs. We have our full team right now, and there isn't much attrition. I don't think they're that kind of an economy anyway, but they are playing a lot of Mahjong waiting for the checks to come in. So it's pretty happy team, too. I mean it's -- if you've gone to China as many times as I have, I'm just always come back pretty energized because they're just such hard-working people, and they're just really enjoy seeing you and they really are authentic and you'll never get more honest questions and honest answers from than you will from the teams in China, your teams or customers or anyone for that matter. So just love it. Justin Bowers : Got it. And then just one follow-up and sort of ending on a more positive note. Within the ProteinSimple franchise, you talk about a lot of runway left. where have you had the most success, which sort of accounts or which end markets and penetrating and where do you think there's more sort of education that needs to happen around adoption of the platform? And so 15% growth going forward is highly attractive in the comps that you put up this quarter as well. So. Charles Kummeth : Yes. Well, we do -- we've got a stable of nice businesses here, a good dozen or so platforms, but three of them are three most important. We put most of our energy and our funding, all had great quarters with 50% growth in Exosome, we had double-digit growth nearly in spatial. We had solid growth in cell and gene therapy, 40% in GMP proteins. We're going to more than double the number of proteins that come out of the factory this coming year. We're building a new factory in China for GMP proteins because the demand there is actually accelerating as well.  So yeah, I think now is the time to be thinking ahead and not be short-term thinking and -- it isn't just our company stock. It's a lot of in our industry. A year from now, this is all, could be all behind us, and there's going to be a fast flight back to quality earnings, and that's us. We make money, and we operate well. But we are definitely can say that we're in a -- we're definitely in a recession. In fact, the whole world is waiting and talking about rates and interest rates are a big issue, obviously, and waiting for a pivot and whether or not we can hit a soft landing and for the economy.  And I'm going to pull out there. I would say, in life sciences, we missed the pit. So in terms of life sciences. It was a hard landing. So we're going to -- but we'll get through it. Disease, neuroscience, cancer. They're not going away on their own. And the big macro trends out there, aging, obesity, things like that are just getting worse, not better. So our time will come again, and the smart investors will be there early. So. Operator : Thank you. We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. Mr. Kummeth, I would now like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments. Charles Kummeth : Well, again, thanks for the quarter. Probably my last full earnings call. This is like number 42 or something like that. Kim will probably take more of a lead next quarter, and I'll be around for a couple more or so. But we're all pretty energized here and still having a good time, and we love what we do, and we love the science. And anyway, we'll see you next quarter. Thanks. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Bio-Techne Earnings Conference Call for the Second Quarter of Fiscal Year 2024. . At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the call will be open for questions following management's prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to David Clair, Bio-Techne's Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. David Clair : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me this morning are Kim Kelderman, Bio-Techne's Chief Executive Officer; Chuck Kummeth, Bio-Techne's former Chief Executive Officer and current Senior Advisor to the company, and Jim Hippel, Chief Financial Office. Before we begin, let me briefly cover our safe harbor statement. Some of the comments made during this conference call may be considered forward-looking statements, including beliefs and expectations about the company's future results. The company's 10-K for fiscal year 2023 identifies certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements made during this call. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements because of any new information or future events or developments. The 10-K as well as the company's other SEC filings, are available on the company's website within its Investor Relations section. During the call, non-GAAP financial measures may be used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. Tables reconciling these measures to most comparable GAAP measures are available in the company's press release issued earlier this morning on the Bio-Techne Corporation website at www.bio-techne.com. Separately, we will be participating in the Barclays and KeyBanc Healthcare conferences during the next three months. We look forward to connecting with many of you at these upcoming events. I will now turn the call over to Chuck. Charles Kummeth : Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter conference call. As many of my official tenure as Bio-Techne's Chief Executive Officer ended yesterday, and Kim Kelderman is now in this leadership role. He's taking over a company that is incredibly well-positioned in several of the highest growth life science and diagnostic end markets. I heard Kim to lead a diagnostic and genomic segment in 2018. In November of 2023, he was appointed Chief Operating Officer, as soon as all operational responsibilities for the company. Prior to Bio-Techne, I worked with Kim for four years at Dental Fisher Scientific. I'm excited for the future of Bio-Techne as it continues to flourish under Kim's leadership. When I joined Bio-Techne in 2013, we were a much smaller organization. With approximately $300 million in revenue at the time, the business was a leader in its legacy $3 billion, total addressable market. But growth had largely styled out at the company. This legacy business of research reagents, immune-supply, and diagnostic controls and calibrators, which we refer to as our core, accounted for almost $650 million in revenue in fiscal 2023, and grew at a 7% figure over that period. Through a combination of 19 acquisitions, prioritized organic investments, and execution from our top-notch leadership team, we leveraged these core products and capabilities and grew the business to over $1.1 billion in fiscal 2023, while expanding our cam to an estimated $27 billion. Under the Bio-Techne umbrella, we now augment this core with high-growth market-leading franchises and proteomic annulment instruments, well-engineered therapy, spatial biology, and their leprosy-gnostics. Our team of over 3,000 global employees has accomplished its magnificent growth while maintaining one of the most attractive profitability profiles in our industry. It's been a pleasure getting to know many of you on this call today and leading this talented team over the last 11 years. I have never been more confident in the long-term growth potential of this business and look forward to its continued evolution in the cam leadership. With that, I'll turn the call over to Kim. Kim Kelderman : Thank you for your kind words, Chuck. And please know that all of us here at Bio-Techne wish you the very best going forward. Now to our Q2 results, the Bio-Techne team continued to execute well in a dynamic and constrained market environment. Our industry has faced several headwinds for over a year now, and those also impacted our second quarter, which resulted in an organic revenue decline of about 2%. The sources of these headwinds continue to be a very soft biotech funding environment, destocking by our large OEM and pharma customers, as well as a broad economic challenge in China, which happens to be historically our high-growth geography. Despite the negative impact from these headwinds, the long-term growth potential of our company remains intact. Our strategic growth pillars, such as the protein simple branded portfolio of analytical tools for protein, our spatial biology franchise, as well as our ExoDx liquid biopsy business, all delivered solid growth during the past quarter. In the years ahead, we will continue to bolster these high-growth businesses with market-leading, high-quality content from our core portfolio of research reagents. By the way, our core portfolio with over 6,000 proteins and more than 400,000 antibodies has been a solid growth business by itself, by delivering an average growth rate of about 7% over the past decade. We will continue to drive growth in this core portfolio and leverage a unique follow-catalog, as well as our expertise to enable industry discoveries, fortifier existing growth pillars, and ultimately improve global healthcare. During my transition period to become CEO, I also spent time understanding the efficiencies of our global operational footprint. We evaluated resource needs across all the businesses. We analyzed relatively strategic importance, as well as profitability of various product categories across our overall portfolio. As our operating margins show, Bio-Techne is already a very efficient organization, but with that said, we have been able to identify opportunities to increase efficiencies throughout the global Bio-Techne operating model. In the face of the current environment, we will remain focused on driving our growth pillars, while executing on those aforementioned efficiency increase opportunities. Before I proceed with the specifics of the quarter, I'd like to officially welcome Matt McMannis to Bio-Techne as the president of Diagnostics and Genomics segment. Matt might be familiar name to several of you as he was formerly Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer for Azenta. Prior to that role, he was leading Bio-Techne's molecular diagnostics business, following our acquisition of Asuragen, where he was the CEO. We are excited to have Matt back at the Bio-Techne family, given his existing knowledge of the business, strong cultural fit and breath of life science leadership experience. He is the ideal leader to take our diagnostics and genomics business to the next stage of growth. Matt runs out the Bio-Techne leadership team that has deep experience and a proven track record of driving growth through market cycles, and I'm excited to lead this talented team going forward. Now let's start with a discussion on our end markets and geographies, biopharma. Biopharma are growth-declined low single digits in the quarter. As we noted at last call, the trajectory for the global biotech sales stepped down at the end of our first quarter and into the early part of our second quarter. This trajectory continued throughout the remainder of that second quarter. The biopharma customers remained very engaged with their sales force, but given the overall funding environment, they took a much more cautious stance on spending in front of their 2024 budget cycles. Onto the academic market -- on the academic side, demand remains very consistent and healthier across the geographies. We drove up a single digit growth in the quarter, and even though we saw a challenging biopharma market, the team has done an excellent job pursuing and converting opportunities in the academic market. From a geographic perspective, you have grew mid single digits. Our strengthened European leadership team continues the positive momentum which we have experienced over the last four quarters. The team executed well, despite the aforementioned spending behavior from our former customers. In North America, we experienced a flatish year-over-year performance. It's worth noting that this is the region where we continue to experience the most significant impact from the soft biotech funding environment. Now moving on to China, you might recall that while accessing our first quarter of the fiscal year, China was highlighted as a geography where we experienced deceleration and spend mostly impacting our portfolio within the protein science segment. These headwinds led to a year-over-year decrease of over 20% in the geography for the quarter. The good news is that following a particularly challenging October and November, the run rate stabilized as we closed the calendar year, and this trend has continued at the start of calendar 2024. While it's difficult to pull the bottom based on two months of performance, we are encouraged with the current trend stabilized. Access to improved healthcare remains the top priority for the China government, and we remain very bullish on the long-term prospects of our product portfolio serving researchers in this region. Now let's discuss our growth pillars, starting with those within our protein science segment. A protein-simple branded portfolio of novel, productivity-driven, analytical tools had a challenging quarter when it comes to new instrument placement. This is related to the budget constraints across biopharma having in China. However, there were a number of green shoots within that portfolio, namely the consumables used specifically on the protein-simple platforms. For the fourth quarter in a row, these consumables have grown by at least 20%, which means that our customers are utilizing our instruments at record levels even when budgets are constrained. Another green shoot has been our Simple Plex platform, an automated multiplexing ELISA instrument, branded Ella. Overall, the platform experienced double-digit growth in Q2 as Ella is becoming the go-to platform in the high-volume accounts, such as CROs and Cell Therapy QC Lab. These accounts perform large translational studies that increasingly rely on the high sensitivity and ease of use of the platform for their multiplexing ELISA needs. As a reminder, we recently received ISO 13485 certification of our Wallingford Connecticut facility. With this important certification in hand, we are now ready to pursue clinical diagnostic opportunities on this instrumentation platform. This will open up a large potential end market for this fast, highly sensitive and easy to use multiplexing immuno-essay instrument. We are encouraged by the number of discussions we are having with potential diagnostic partners and we are taking steps to further position Ella as the platform of choice for high-value diagnostic application. The third green shoot, the narrow protein simple growth pillar has been our biologics platform, branded Maurice. Excluding China, this platform grew over 20% in Q2. We see significant traction of the recent launch of Maurice's flex, specifically in biological drug development and drug production. This makes a lot of sense because in addition to protein charge, protein size and identity capabilities, this next generation platform is also an easy to use replacement for the legacy mass spectrometry fractionation methods including Ion Exchange Chromatography. Following the Maurice's flex launch in March of last year, we are seeing a growing number of publications which is driving awareness and demand for this instrument. I'll shift now to our other major growth pillars within the protein science segment, cell and gene therapy. This business vertical includes our portfolio of proteomic reagents as well as scalable workflow solutions that enable our customers to accelerate progress towards the commercialization of their next generation cell and gene therapies. The customers for these solutions are mainly biotech companies and our Q2 results were therefore equally impacted by the same funding constraints that I talked about earlier. However, short-term funding constraints have not changed our conviction that cell and gene therapy is here to stay. In fact, we believe that these technologies will play a significant role in treating and curing terrible diseases and therefore we will continue to invest in the strategic growth pillar. During the quarter, we filed the first Drug Master File or DMF for an animal free accelerate GMP expansion medium. This filing joins a growing list of almost three filings that span our GMP product portfolio. These DMFs enable our cell therapy customers to cross-reference that filing when submitting to the FDA making their IMD process much easier. This way, our products effectively can expect into our customers workflow. We're also expanding our market leading GMP portfolio to include additional media formulation, gene engineering capabilities and GMP antibodies. These activities will further solidify Bio-Technes market position in this rapidly growing industry. In addition, we are finalizing the closed-to-air-out immune cell therapy manufacturing solution which pairs our GMP proteins and our GMP media with the Wilson-Wolves G-REX. Overall, the protein science segment experienced a full percent organic revenue decrease in the quarter. It's been impacted by the current biotech funding landscape, the order timing among a handful of large biopharma customers, as well as the constrained macro environment in China. But as the green shoots that I discussed already indicate, this segment is positioned for accelerated growth than the macro funding challenges abate. Now let's discuss the growth pillars within our diagnostics and genomics segment starting with our spatial biology franchise. This division includes our ACD-branded products, as well as the Lunaphore branded spatial biology automated solution. ACD's RNA scope continues to play an important role in advancing gene therapy, neurosciences and cancer research. Despite the challenging macro environment, this portfolio remains in high demand, growing mid-teens globally for the quarter. We're also excited about the traction we are experiencing with the recently acquired Lunaphore platform. As a reminder, we are currently commercializing the Comet instrument, a fully automated, high-throughput, high-perplex platform that does not require use of conjugated primary antibody. Comet's high-value proposition is resonating with the translational research community, which is driving significant interest and rapid growth in our installed base. In fact, demand for the Comet instrument exceeded our manufacturing capacity, which created a backlog during this quarter. We are currently scaling our Comet production capacity to meet this strong demand. A final note around our spatial biology business is that we recently announced the upcoming lounge of fully automated spatial multiomics workflow with detection of RNA and protein markers on the same tissue section. This workflow pairs ACDs, RNA-scoped technologies of Lunaphore's fully automated Comet platform, and we will be showcasing this complete solution at the upcoming HBT next week in Orlando. Now, let's discuss our other growth pillar within DGS, the Molecular Diagnostics business. Our ExoDx prostate test provides valuable information on whether a man with a gray-zone PSA score should proceed with an invasive and potentially dangerous prostate biopsy or not. With 30% volume growth in our second quarter, the value of this test continues to resonate with both patients and physicians. Our Exosome-based development pipeline includes single gene mutation tests for monitoring various cancer markers, as well as a colorectal cancer screening test designed for early detection of both colorectal cancer and pre-cancerous pellets. We look forward to sharing additional data on this exciting pipeline in the coming quarters. Overall, the diagnostics and genomic segments grew by 5% organically in the quarter, but was muted by the de-stocking and strict inventory management from our core diagnostics OEM customers. As these OEM customers return to normalized buying patterns, the results from our spatial biology and molecular diagnostic growth pillars will become more visible at the segment level. In summary, I'm extremely proud of the team's ability to navigate the transitory challenges that are impacting both biotechne and the broader life sciences tool industry. Our portfolio of coorley agents, our growth pillars in proteomic analytical tools, in cell and gene therapies, in spatial biology, and in molecular diagnostics are well positioned to improve the quality of life by catalyzing advances in sciences and medicine. Thank you very much, and with that, I'll turn it over to Jim. Jim? James Hippel : Thank you, Kim. I'll start with some additional detail on our Q2 financial performance, then give some thoughts on the financial outlook. Starting with the overall second quarter financial performance, adjusted EPS was $0.40, compared to $0.47 in the prior year quarter. Foreign exchange benefit EPS by $0.02. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.17, compared to $0.31 in the prior year. Q2 revenue was $272.6 million, a decrease of 2% year-over-year on an organic basis, and was flat on a reported basis. Foreign exchange translation had a favorable 1% impact, while acquisitions also contributed 1% to reported growth. Looking at our organic growth by region and end market in Q2, North America declined slightly year-over-year. Europe increased mid-single digits, and China declined over 20% in the quarter. As Kim mentioned, the soft biotech funding environment combined with overall conservatism from our biopharmic customers, were both a drag on our North American business, and to a lesser extent also represented a headwind to our European performance relative to more recent quarters. APAC, outside of China, increased low single digits overall, with government funding constraints in South Korea, partially offset by growth in Japan and India. For China, the soft government funding environment continue to impact the region. Following many months of decelerating run rates in China, we experienced a stabilization in our run rate business in December. Encouragingly, the stabilization has continued as we began calendar 2024. It is challenging to call the bottom in this dynamic geography, that we are optimistic that headwinds going forward will be less severe. It'll likely be a while before we return to the kind of growth rates that we historically achieved in China. But we remain confident that China will still be the fastest growing major region in the world for life science tools over the long term. By end market and Q2, excluding China, biopharmic declined low single digits, while academia grew upper single digits. U.S. revenue on the P&L total company adjusted gross margin was 69.7% in the quarter compared to 71.7% in the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by lower volume leverage, unfavorable product mix, and the impact of the Luma-4 acquisition. Adjusted SG&A and Q2 was 31.2% of revenue compared to 27.9% in the prior year, while R&D expense in Q2 was 8.4% of revenue compared to 8.3% in the prior year. The increase in SG&A was driven primarily by the Luma-4 acquisition, partially offset by diligent cost management across the business. The price increases implemented during fiscal year '23 continue to offset the dollar impact of inflation to operating income, with pricing also largely offsetting the inflationary impact on our operating margin in Q2. Adjusted operating margin for Q2 was 30.1%, a decrease of 540 basis points from the prior year period. Excluding the Luma-4 acquisition, which closed at the beginning of Q1, adjusted operating margin was 300 basis points lower than the prior year, due to the impact of unfavorable volume leverage and product mix. Looking at our numbers below operating income, net interest expense in Q2 was $3.4 million, increasing $1.2 million compared to the prior year period due to higher debt levels. Our bank debt and the balance sheet as we ended Q2 stood at $447 million, an increase of $7 million compared to last quarter. Other adjusted non-operating income was $3.1 million a quarter, an increase of $3.1 million compared to prior year, primarily reflecting our 20% share of Wilson-Wilson Adjustment Income and the foreign exchange impacts related to our cash pooling arrangement. Moving further down the P&L, our adjusted effective tax rate in Q1 was 22%. Flat sequentially, but up 100 basis points compared to the prior year due to geographic mix. Turning to cash flow and return of capital, $83.1 million of cash was generated from operations in the quarter, and our net investment in capital expenditures was $14.9 million. Also during Q2, we returned capital to shareholders by a way of $12.5 million in dividend and completed an $80 million buyback of 1.4 million shares. We finished the quarter with 160.1 million average diluted shares outstanding. Our balance sheet finished Q2 in a strong position with $135.6 million in cash, and our total leverage stood below one time due to that. Going forward, M&A remained the top priority for capital allocation. Now I'll discuss the performance of our reporting segment starting with the protein science assignment. Q2 reported sales were $107.7 million, which reported revenue decreasing 3% compared to the prior year period. Organic revenue decreased 4%, but foreign exchange having a 1% favorable impact. As a reminder, is our protein science assignment that has the most exposure to the China geographic region as well as to the biotech and market. Operating margin for the protein science assignment was 40.3%, a decrease of 350 basis points compared to the prior year quarter, as unfavorable volume and product mix were partially offset by cost management initiatives. Turning to the diagnostic syndrome segment, Q2 reported sales were $75.4 million, with reported growth increasing 11% compared to the same quarter last year. Organic revenue growth for the assignment was 5%, with acquisitions having a 5% impact and foreign exchange having a favorable impact of 1%. As Kim previously mentioned, organic growth was driven by our spatial biology and molecular diagnostic growth pillars, partially muted by the de-stocking and older timing of our core diagnostic region-only customers. Moving on to the diagnostics and genomic segment operating margin, at 6%, the segment operating margin decrease compared to the prior year's 12.2% due primarily to the impact of room for acquisition. However, Q2 operating margin improved 530 basis points sequentially from Q1, due to improving volume leverage and favorable mix. As we turn the page on Q2 and look ahead to the back half of our fiscal year, there are still reasons to remain cautious, but there are also some reasons or green shoots, as Kim called them, for optimism in the near term. On the macro front, biotech funding has not dramatically started flooding back, nor has the Chinese economy and funding of life science research returned to its pre-COVID strength. But inflation and interest rates are period of stabilize. And according to some analysts reports, biotech funding has already been reduced to a level not seen since 2016. Having recently bended China and Q2, Kim, Chuck and I all witnessed the local economy on the move with crowded streets and restaurants and busy regional airports. And for several years of COVID shutdown, the local economy is starting to bustle once again and likely generating tax revenue for their government. As for biotech, our growth pillars are continuing to shine even these typical macro conditions. We are closely monitoring sequential run rates in our reagents business to help determine where we are at in this bottoming process. It's early in the new quarter, but thus far we are encouraged that the worst may be behind us. This does not mean we expect a quick acceleration of growth. But we do expect that the trend of decelerating growth that has been pervasive throughout this macroeconomic cycle may have subsided. Down cycles like we experienced over the past 18 months or so are never fun. But the resiliency of our growth pillars throughout this cycle has given us even greater confidence that our company will grow at a double digit growth rate when markets normalize in the long-term. As our markets start to normalize and prepare for the inevitable return to growth, we will continue to diligently manage our cost structure and invest in the business for the future. As Kim mentioned in his opening comments, we continue to identify opportunities for efficiencies and by executing on these opportunities. We'll protect and even grow our adjusting operating margins sequentially for the remainder of the fiscal year. That concludes my prepared comments. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator instructions]. Our first questions come from the line of Puneet Soda with Learink Partners. Please proceed with your questions. Puneet Soda : Yeah, hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. And Chuck, it was really great working with you and good luck ahead. Kim, welcome on board again. It's good to have you in the role leading the company. And Matt, really glad to have you back at Biotech.net as well. So maybe let me ask my question. It's really around the headwinds that have existed for the last few quarters. You have known them. We have seen that across the industry, China, Biopharma. I think the question really here is what changed in the quarter within your assumptions? You were expecting a flat result in this quarter. You ended up down 2%. So maybe just walk us through, is there something in the portfolio? Is it specific to customer orders? Or is there something in the forecasting process that's not working well that yielded this result versus what you were expecting? And then I have a follow-up. Charles Kummeth : Thank you, Puneet. Good morning. And thanks for your kind words towards our team. A great question. I, of course, have an opinion on which of these headwinds are going to be most significant going forward. But in that area of view, we certainly have a good understanding of which ones are most significant. So I'll let Jim talk about that. James Hippel : Yeah, I got Puneet. Good morning. I was the one that called that forecast, so I speak. So I need to speak to it. As we ended the last quarter, we were pretty transparent on the call that in the last couple of weeks, as we closed Q1 in the first few weeks, as we opened Q2, that we've seen a step down in deceleration in our biotech especially, but even a bit in pharma. And so the reality is, and we've talked about this in various conferences throughout, that that trend had continued. And the time of the call, a few weeks doesn't necessarily make a trend. So we took a view on our growth rates decelerating from where they were in Q1. But obviously that trend ended up being longer and deeper than we anticipated. So that's kind of how and why we ended up where we did. That being said, as we look forward, and again, more optimistic view coming out of last quarter and going into this quarter than we did prior quarter in that run rates as we talked about it stabilized in China. And we're just seeing overall stabilization in our business as we enter this quarter relative to how we entered Q2. But I will temper that a bit by saying just like last quarter, a few weeks or even a month doesn't necessarily make a trend either. But we definitely have seen a bit of a momentum shift or at least stabilization from where we are at this point going into this quarter versus last quarter. Puneet Soda : Okay, that's helpful. Maybe on the guide, Jim, I just wanted to clarify that you expect this quarter to be a low point based on the comments you mentioned about China early signs and stabilization there and Biopharma remaining status quo. Maybe just help us think about the next two quarters or for the full year just in terms of where models are? If you could walk us through your assumptions on how you're thinking about the growth rate here. I appreciate any context on that. James Hippel : Sure. Well, I would say this. I mean, I talk about that we have a sense that the deceleration is slowing and perhaps stopping. And so what I mean by that is, and I think you've heard this many of our peers already, that kind of expect our Q3 to be somewhat similar to our Q2 in terms of organic growth. Beyond that, it's difficult to call. The whole bottoming process has been difficult to call. But I pretty much agree with what's being set out there by our larger companies who have even greater overall market access that it feels like the first half of the year, '24 will be more difficult than the second half. But we'll obviously get into our planning process here in about three or four months and have more to talk about our fiscal year, '25 following that. But that's pretty much, our view is pretty much consistent with what you're hearing from our peer companies. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Jacob Johnson with Stephens. Please proceed with your questions. Jacob Johnson : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Maybe just first to unpack the biopharma commentary. The release suggests those kind of headwinds increased in December. Can you just talk to kind of what you saw then? What caused that or what you think caused that? Maybe the evil CFOs, Jim. And then just as we look ahead, kind of what are you seeing from that end market to start the year? Have you seen any kind of change in customer behaviors, the calendar's turned? James Hippel : I'll start off and I like to comment perhaps, since you mentioned the evil CFO comment. I think that's partly what it was in a sense that I talked about in some prior conferences that in talking to our customers, the interest is as high, it's not highest it's ever been in our products, but getting purchases through, particularly large, any larger purchases through their internal purchasing departments or their finance departments was difficult and there was a sense of hold off until the next calendar year and calendar year budgets are set. And so we'll see if that actually materializes this quarter but there was definitely that conversation, those conversations going on with our customers. But I think, quantitatively, there's been a number of reports put out there by analysts who file very closely the biotech funding and they all basically say that biotech funding was down over 20% in the December quarter and I think down sequentially, like in the mid-teens even. So there was definitely a drop off in biotech funding and that's a decent chunk of our business. So I think that goes without saying that was a clear driver for what occurred within the quarter. Kim Kelderman : Yeah, let me add to that. You know, obviously, biopharma market has been constrained by lower funding than usual. If not mistaken, we've probably hit the lowest point since 2016. However, our portfolio is well positioned, right? So we have in the quarter the highest quality products that will produce and give you the best results. So you don't have to repeat your experiments, which of course is important in a constrained environment like this. And secondly, our implementation portfolio is to optimize efficiency. So to have fewer people in the laboratory to automate clunky processes, that will give you the efficiencies you need and the reproducibility in your results that you need. So overall, a portfolio is tailored to a constrained environment like this one and I think therefore that we will come out strong once funding normalized. James Hippel : Now I'll just reiterate what Kim talked about in his opening comments to reinforce that, is that our consumables on our instrument platforms were up again this quarter nearly 20% and they'd been up 20% or more every quarter for the past four quarters in this has been a declining market overall the past year. So I think that's a clear sign of how our tools provide the productivity that our customers need in an environment like this. Not to mention the potential pent-up demand for new instruments once funding becomes more prevalent. Jacob Johnson : Got it. Thanks for all that. And then my follow-up. Kim, you mentioned earlier this year and then on this call again that given the current environment you can look more internally at your footprint and efficiencies. I think there was a restructuring charge in the quarter as well. Can you just elaborate on that statement and kind of what efforts are you taking right now and maybe for Jim how we should think about the impact of those on margins? Kim Kelderman : Yeah, thanks Jacob. As I think about the constraint environment you always got to make sure that you tailor your organization to be most efficient in such environments. Not only to protect the bottom line but also to make sure that you're most efficient coming out of such constraint period. So yes, we've looked at level loading the capacity of our employees over certain businesses in certain pockets, volumes and revenues are more down in others. So we of course want to make sure that we do the right things there from a worse power point of view. And then secondly, it's a good time to look at which businesses are core and strategic to you. And in our case we found some businesses where there's either a growth profile and or a bottom line profile that doesn't fit our long-term financial strategies and expectations and or businesses that take this proportional amount of management attention and that do not have synergies with our current channels or products. So those are businesses that we will evaluate and over time we'll divest. Jacob Johnson : Got it. Thanks for taking the questions. Oh, sorry, go ahead Jim. James Hippel : I was going to say with regards to the impact to margins. So what this does is some of the actions we're taking gives us a much higher level of confidence that the margins reported this quarter will be the low point for the year and we'll progress sequentially going forward. And I know you're going to ask me how much and I think we're targeting to get back into the mid-30% range by the end of the year for Q4. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Dan Arias with Stifel. Please proceed with your questions. Dan Arias : Good morning guys. Thanks for the questions. Kim or Chuck can you just maybe talk a little bit about the antibodies business and the antibodies market just given that there are a decent number of moving parts in the mix when it comes to the environment and environment, It would just be great to get some color on what you think is relevant when it comes to the portfolio, pricing, share changes, etc.? Charles Kummeth : Yeah Dan, thank you so much for your question. Our antibody business has done quite well. I think it's been running at the low single digits even in this environment. So with the Headwins in Biopharma, we certainly have to make sure that some of our sales force focuses on academic markets and make sure they close deals over there and we get better in that space. Our quality of our antibodies is world renowned and we know that we can compete even at higher prices with other antibody companies and we are really confident that we will be able to continue to do so. Of course, we have had some head-wins in addition from de-stocking where people would have fewer or less antibodies on the shelf. However, we feel confident that that symptom is now towards the end of its face so that we feel that HAT win will abate. Dan Arias : Okay, helpful. And then Jim, I hate to ask about 2025 since the second half of this year is tough to call, but if I go back to the analyst's day and I think about the growth platforms that you guys highlighted, four or five of them had double digit market growth rates attached to them. So does it feel like six to 12 months from now your growth verticals are ramped up enough and the comps are favorable enough to where a two-digit growth number that's more typical of what you've done in the past comes back into the picture? James Hippel : Yeah, what I'd say is this, Dan, is that we have a high level of confidence given our relative performance of our growth pillars even in this environment that once the market gets back to its long-term four or six, let's call it mid-single-digit growth trajectory, that we will be well into the double-digit growth once our core is back up there and then, of course, the growth pillar is on top of that. So, asking how long it takes to get there is also asking how long it takes for the market, overall market to normalize, and I don't have a crystal ball on that, but assuming it does normalize as we get into the end of calendar year '25 and, hopefully by then, then the answer would be yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question has come from the lawn of Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Please proceed with your questions. Patrick Donnelly : Hey, guys, good morning. Thanks for taking the question and Chuck, a second. My congrats there. You know, maybe Jim, on the near-term, just to recue a piece, we're getting a good amount of questions just in terms of how to think about it. You know, is it flat? Is that the right organic, kind of near over-near number to think about 3C? If you could just help us kind of frame up the near-term, it would be helpful on the organic roadside. Charles Kummeth : Yeah, I mean, specifically, right now, our base case is that the growth rate we experience in Q3 will be similar to the growth rate we saw in Q2. So the deceleration of our growth rate that we've seen, the deceleration of our growth rate that we've seen in the past three or four quarters we think is behind us. Patrick Donnelly : Yes, I understand. Okay. And then maybe in China, it sounds like, obviously, Jim, we chatted and you were over there. Maybe just talk about your expectations for the recovery in that region? James Hippel : I know in the past, whether it was government or whatever it may be, you guys saw some real snapbacks quarter to quarter. Last time we chatted, it sounded like that was a little less likely, maybe a little more of a stability into a gradual recovery. But maybe just talk to us about what you saw over there and again, the expectations over the next few quarters relative to some of the past cycles that we've seen. Thank you, Patrick. I'm going to hand this over to Kim. I know we feel exactly the same way about this, but he was there actually more recently than I even was. So go ahead, Kim. Kim Kelderman : Yeah, Patrick. Well, thanks for the question. What we feel is that, obviously, China is an important country to us, right? Ten percent of our revenues come from there. We have been able to outgrow most of our peers over the last half decade. But that also made it tough over the last couple of quarters where China truly came to a standstill. And we feel that the activity in China is stabilizing. We do not see a clear light at the end of the funnel. Our comparables are going to be a little bit better in the coming quarters, but not for instruments, right? So it's not that we are over that hump. We do think, though, that China is going to be a fast growing market in the future. We do expect that China will have a kind of a bias towards China for China. Therefore, we are building a local GMP facility to serve the local market. And then at the end of the day, we feel that our products with the high quality and the automation aspects will increase efficiency and will continue to find a real good spot in China. And I think that the current pull-through of our consumables shows that the instruments are getting used at a record pace at the moment. As I mentioned, we are long-term believers in China, and we believe that China will get back to normalized funding and use the funds to prioritize health care. So we are very optimistic over time. But if you ask when or what will trigger a V-shaped recovery that I won't be able to answer, we think it will be a slower recovery than usually. Operator : Thank you. Our next question has come from the line of Dan Leonard with UBS. Please proceed with your questions. Dan Leonard : Hi, thank you. I just want to make sure I understand the decline in the protein sciences business. You commented on the antibody trends to Dan Arias, low single-digit growth. But can you speak to the growth rate of core reagents and aggregate, so your antibodies, proteins, ELISA? And how steep was the decline in instrument revenue? Kim Kelderman : Yeah, I'll jump on this one and then can comment further. Dan, thanks for the question. We're not going to give specifics at that level of detail, but what I would say is that in general, our overall, our reagents were down year over year, even though antibodies were slightly up. And our instruments were down as well, given the capital constraints in particular from our customers. However, again, as I mentioned again, the cartridges and consumables that are used specifically on those instruments were up nearly 20%. Cell and gene therapy is a big user of our reagents and also a high concentration of our biotech customers. And so that also impacted, we think, temporarily our reagent sales within the quarter. Dan Leonard : Understood. And Jim, possibly you could comment on the growth rate for the cell and gene therapy portfolio specifically, either just GMP proteins or more holistically as you measure all the touch points you have in that market? James Hippel : Yeah. Well, it was down year over year. I'm not going to give specifics to how much it was down, but I think an encouraging point is that the actual number of orders, invoices, et cetera, that we sold was still at an all-time record level. So what that tells us is that the customers were being more conservative in their purchases in terms of quantities, but still very active in their research within cell and gene therapy. Kim Kelderman : Okay. Thank you. I can add some information there. I think that, as Jim mentioned, the volume of orders was higher than usual, but we did have a couple of larger orders push out. The thing that we can do as a company is make sure that we have new product introductions and the team is set to add five new GMP proteins to be released in the coming quarters so that we have a broader portfolio that serves more customers, and we'll also increase share of wallets. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Matthew Larew with William Blair. Please proceed with your questions. Matthew Larew : Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to go back to the biopharmic comments because obviously you referenced sort of a further deterioration in the quarter, which you had set up on the last call, but on the press release mentioned conservatism from a subset of biotech customers. So I guess if I just think about sources of the Edwin being funding-related versus being perhaps budget-related at biopharma companies that may have commercial assets, but again, we're just going through the budget process. What do you view as more of the gain factor? Are you waiting for turnaround and funding, or is it more just budgets had to get put in place and now there might be more constructive conversations? James Hippel : Yeah, I think for us, given our waiting of customer base, the biotech funding was the biggest driver. I think the conservatism from pharma was secondary and hopefully much more transitory. So I think that's our view. Kim? Kim Kelderman : No, I would agree. Okay, fair enough. And then obviously you referenced M&A continuing to be a high priority and looks like some deals are starting to get done. Matthew Larew : Just curious, obviously you had the Lunaphore acquisition here recently, either from a size portfolio perspective. What are you seeing out there that's interesting and are you starting to see evaluations move more in line with public markets? Kim Kelderman : Yeah, thanks for the question. To quickly jump on to the Lunaphore acquisition, it's obviously, we are very, very happy with the acquisition itself. The assets, the team is amazing. Integration is going well. And of course, it will give us a fantastic position in the lucrative and fast-growing spatial biology market. As this instrument, the Comet, will give us fully automated capabilities and multi-alcoholic aspects where we can look at proteins and RNA in the same slide and then combining that with the ACD portfolio and our antibodies here in our systems. It's an unbelievable value proposition. We would love to do more of those. So we are always on the lookout. We have interest in looking at filling out our sub-engine therapy portfolios. We would like, if there's opportunities, to strengthen our core. We've talked about the four growth verticals and if we can bolt something on to make those even stronger and get our positions more differentiated, that'd be fantastic. And any opportunity that pulls through our core reagents is really on our list. And as we always maintain the long list, but we will be disciplined in picking opportunities that would meet or exceed our financial expectations over time, which is basically contributing to the financial expectations that we've all set to by technique overall. And whether this would be a small or large or public or private company, we really don't select between that. We are open to any target that fits the mold that I just described. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Catherine Schulte with Baird. Please proceed with your questions. Catherine Schulte : Hey guys, thanks for the questions and congrats Chuck on the retirement. Maybe first in pharma and biotech, I think you said down low single digits outside of China. You just talk a little about what you're seeing from emerging biotech versus kind of mid-sized and large customers and how you see those two groups playing out going forward? James Hippel : Yeah. Hi Catherine. Thanks for the question. It's difficult to ascertain exactly small, sometimes smaller and larger biotechs, as many of these are private companies and hopefully they are, isn't always easy to determine. But I would just say, in generally speaking, the smaller the biotech, usually the more difficult the funding situation is. That being said, we haven't been at the JPMorgan conference, called another green shoot perhaps, but the level of activity that we saw around VC firms, private equity firms in general, out sniffing around for all kinds of investment opportunities, whether it was in tools or whether it was in biotech, et cetera, was some of the highest levels that I've seen in many years there. So, again, encouraging that perhaps the drought and funding has hit its low point and might come back this calendar year and that will obviously benefit our smaller biotech customers.  Yeah, I never can add to that. I think that the smaller and newer biopharmac companies obviously are in a different life cycle. So they typically still have to build out their labs and define their processes and validate the way they measure things. So that's where we see, our automation platforms, of course, being placed. And then the midsize ones are often running and they might have repositioned a number of projects to run in parallel, but certainly they typically already have our instrumentation. They're a little bit more consumable-oriented because they are pulling through these consumables. And then large pharma has gone through a phase where they repositioned the portfolios just as well. And there we see a mix, right? So there's a capacity expansion by buying more instruments and there's, of course, the pull-through and consumable. So that's how I look at the influence versus size. Catherine Schulte : Okay, got it. And then you talked about these decelerating trends, hopefully being behind you here and three-q organic growth, both looking similar to the second quarter. Do you think we could see a return to positive organic growth in 4Q, or is that more likely going to be a fiscal 25 event? James Hippel : Anything's possible, Catherine. Sure. I mean, is that within the wiggle room of possibilities? Yes, in fact, the tide is turning some momentum and China truly stabilizes. I think there's a potential for it. I'm not, I would say, I'd mute it by saying it would be flight growth probably, but I think there's a potential for it. We're seeing sequential improvement in our businesses, so that's encouraging. Operator : Thank you. Our next question has come from the line of Alex Nowak with Craig Hallam. Please proceed with your questions. Alex Nowak : All right. Good morning, everyone. How is Wilson Wolf progressing since you made that investment there? Just curious where they deployed the cash, the cash infusion, and just how they're handling the biotech funding environment? James Hippel : Yeah, thank you for the question. So Wilson Wolf has tremendous progress behind them now in this last year. Overall, the year was hard because the, some of the early stage activities and clinical projects have been canceled. So overall, they're down mid-single digits, but the last quarter and last has been much, much better back in the black, and we do see a progress in the pipeline. We see that there are various clinical studies rolling into next phases, and we even see an approval upcoming where the G-REX is packed in. So overall, we believe that Wilson Wolf will be doing great again, and we know that John Wilson has invested in activities that bolster the adoption of our G-REX and the Wilson Wolf franchise. As we have a very genius deal structure around the Wilson Wolf, and at the latest, it's the end of calendar year 2027 that Wilson Wolf will be fully part of the biotech new family. I'll just add too, with regards to their financial performance, they had a tough calendar year '23 like we all have, but they actually did see significant sequential improvement in their December quarter and are expecting continued sequential improvement from there. So that's encouraging also. Given their, they have even much wider visibility into the cell and gene therapy market than we do. Operator : Thank you. We have reached the end of our question and answer session. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Kim Kellehrman for any closing remarks. Kim Kelderman : Yeah, thank you, and thanks everyone for joining the call. Of course, one last time, thank you Chuck for your leadership over the last decade plus. As you can hear, I'm excited about the long-term position and our prospects as a company. We have a great strategy in place. I'm also very proud of the biotech need team for executing so well in this constrained environment. And I'm absolutely looking forward to navigating these constraints and I'm looking forward to speaking again at our next earnings release. Operator : Thank you. That does include today's telecom. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Bio-Techne Earnings Conference Call for the Third Quarter of Fiscal Year 2024. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the call will be open for questions following management\u2019s prepared remarks. During our Q&A session, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. I would now like to turn the call over to David Clair, Bio-Techne\u2019s Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. David Clair : Good morning and thank you for joining us. On the call with me this morning are Kim Kelderman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Hippel, Chief Financial Officer of Bio-Techne. Before we begin, let me briefly cover our safe harbor statement. Some of the comments made during this conference call may be considered forward-looking statements, including beliefs and expectations about the company\u2019s future results. The company\u2019s 10-K for fiscal year 2023 identifies certain factors that could cause the company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements made during this call. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements because of any new information or future events or developments. The 10-K as well as the company\u2019s other SEC filings are available on the company\u2019s website within its Investor Relations section. During the call, non-GAAP financial measures may be used to provide pertinent to ongoing business performance. Tables reconciling these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available in the company\u2019s press release issued earlier this morning on the Investor Relations section of our Bio-Techne Corporation website at www.bio-techne.com. Separately, we will be presenting at the Bank of America, Benchmark, Leerink, William Blair, Jefferies and Scotiabank conferences in the coming weeks. We look forward to connecting with many of you at these upcoming events. I will now turn the call over to Kim. Kim Kelderman : Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter conference call. I\u2019m pleased to report that our third quarter outperformed our initial expectations as several of the green shoots we\u2019ve discussed during our last earnings call continue to sprout and combined with excellent execution by our Bio-Techne team contributed to delivering 2% year-over-year organic revenue growth. We\u2019re looking forward to seeing these green shoots further develop as the headwinds we have faced, namely the biotech funding and the macroeconomic challenges in China continue to stabilize and eventually improve. Our team demonstrated that our product portfolio can show relative strong performance in the stabilizing but still challenging end markets. And therefore, we are confident that we can perform extremely well when our end markets fully recover. Additionally, we delivered this quarter\u2019s growth while we continue to focus on profitability. The recent initiatives to drive efficiencies across the organization while investing to position the business for future growth are taking hold. And this shows by our adjusted operating margin increasing sequentially by 290 basis points to 33%. Our growth pillars within our portfolio continue to lead to our strong performance with a new quarterly record for our GMP reagents business, a continued increase in adoption of our ExoDx Prostate test, robust utilization trends across our proteomic analytical tools portfolio and strong demand for Comet, a fully automated special biology instrument. I will double-click on these highlights and encouraging trends later in the call. First, I\u2019d like to bring to your attention. The Bio-Techne\u2019s recent recognition by CiteAb, a reagent search and data services company. Bio-Techne did not receive just one, but two awards. The first award I would like to mention was received for being the ELISA Kit Supplier of the Year. This important designation is awarded to the ELISA kit manufacturer that receives the most citations throughout the year. Citations are an important indicator of market adoption, particularly within academia. We are proud of our leading portfolio of ELISA kit stemming from a long history of innovation. CiteAb also recognized Bio-Techne\u2019s RNAscope HiPlex 12 with the Innovation Award. That is acknowledging its role in enabling spatial detection of RNA in tissue. Our overall spatial biology efforts were also recognized as Bio-Techne was highly commended for Educational Initiative of the Year, which is related to our ongoing work to enhance spatial biology research and education. This recognition is representative of our company\u2019s vision to work together with our customers to unlock the possibilities of science. The second topic I want to highlight is related to artificial intelligence. Given the significant potential that AI and machine learning bring to the advancing science, I want to describe an example of one of the many ways our team is proactively and safely, leveraging these important tools. As you already know, Bio-Techne is the global leader in research use only proteins. Researchers from around the world rely on our portfolio of highly bioactive proteins for many important laboratory workflows. Some examples of these workflows include cell growth and differentiation, antibody production and screening as well as biomarkers in disease monitoring. We are leveraging AI capabilities to create new patentable, hyperactive designer proteins and other reagents with new functionalities. For over 40 years, Bio-Techne has been on the leading edge of protein development and bioactivity. Today, we are using the power of AI to increase that lead even further. Now let\u2019s get deeper into our quarterly results, starting with an overview of our end markets followed by our geographies. Our biopharma end market performance led by our cell and gene therapy growth vertical improved sequentially with a low single-digit increase compared to the prior year quarter. Industry reports point to a recovery in biotech funding during the first calendar year of 2024 with estimates suggesting significantly higher funding levels compared to pre-COVID periods. However, this increase in funding comes after a December quarter that was an eight-year low. So it may be too early to call this a new trend. But nonetheless, it\u2019s a green shoot that appears to be taking root. And if so, could blossom into meaningful revenue growth as we get into our fiscal year 2025. On the academic side, we delivered low single-digit revenue growth, even though we had a tough comparable from robust mid-teens performance in Europe last year. Within the U.S. and Europe, academic budgets remain stable and their spatial biology and proteomic instrument growth pillars outperformed in these end markets. Now I will discuss the three geographies. North America improved sequentially with year-over-year growth in the low single-digits. This improvement was led by a strong performance in cell and gene therapy. Europe declined mid single-digits as mid-teens growth in the prior year period created a challenging comp for the geography. However, on a multiyear CAGR basis, Europe has performed well, mid single-digit growth. Last but not least, I will discuss China, which saw revenue decline in the mid single-digits versus prior year. We mentioned in our last earnings call that we saw a stabilization of revenues in December and January and we called for revenues in Q3 to be similar to Q2, and that was indeed in line with how the quarter played out, which is a confirmatory sign that the bottom may have been reached in China. With the deceleration of revenue in China seemingly behind us, we also saw some green shoots in the region with China\u2019s State Council\u2019s introduction of a broad economic stimulus plan. This plan is focused on upgrading equipment across several industry to support innovation. While the specifics of this $70 billion lending program remain fluid, we anticipate that this will be a multiyear program that will eventually have a positive impact on our insulin business. Improving healthcare remains a priority for the Chinese government in our portfolios of bioactive reagents, proteomic analysis and spatial biology technologies will remain important tools for the modernization of healthcare in China. Now let\u2019s discuss our segments and their growth pillars, starting with our Protein Sciences segment, where revenue declined 1% year-over-year on an organic basis. This is a sequential improvement from our second quarter and reflects the stabilizing of the biopharma and Chinese end markets. Our Protein Sciences segment is where we have the most exposure to these end markets and stands to benefit the most from the green shoots taking root. Utilization of our protein simple branded portfolio of proteomic analytical tools remain very strong as consumables used on those instruments continued its long streak of double-digit growth. This growth was broad-based and was further enhanced by the growing installed base and expanding applications of these productivity tools. Examples of new applications are fractionation on MauriceFlex as well as QA and QC applications for gene therapies across our platforms, such as Maurice Simple Western and Simple Plex. Our Simple Western platform of automated western blot solutions continues to gain share as demonstrated by the low double-digit growth for this quarter. The platform performance if it comes to ease of use, speed and reproducibility, compares very well to manual methods, which resonates with both our biopharma and academic end users. Customers continue to expand the Simple Western use case and workflows as we can see from increased utilization in gene therapy, potency release and quantitative immunoassay application. We are encouraged with the uptake of this novel instrument and given its low mid-teens market penetration and its expanded use cases, we see a long runway for adoption of this technology. Now let\u2019s discuss the promising opportunity for our multiplex ELISA instrument branded Ella as a clinical diagnostic platform. Following the recent ISO 13485 Certification, we are now ready to pursue clinical diagnostic opportunities on the Ella platform. This opens up a large potential end market for this highly sensitive, fast and easy to use multiplexing immunoassay instrument. The recently announced partnership with Novomol-Dx is a great example of this opportunity. Their Bio-Marker Pathfinder, or BMP kit utilizes Ella, its consumables as well as Bio-Techne\u2019s reagents as the basis for their point-of-care [indiscernible] test. Novomol-Dx will initially launch the BMP kit in India that has potential to deploy this test more globally in the future. Moving on to the performance of the next growth pillar within Protein Sciences, which is cell and gene therapy. This novel portfolio of reagents, media, analytical and workflow solutions enables our customers to further their therapeutic development to progress through clinical trials and to make continued inroads towards the commercialization of these next-generation therapies. Collectively, our portfolio of cell and gene therapy products and services increased over 30% in the quarter. GMP reagents, including GMP proteins and small molecules, remain a cornerstone of our cell therapy offering. We experienced continued traction during the quarter, especially in regenerative medicine applications. In the current quarter, we will be strengthening our GMP reagent portfolio with the launch of GMP antibodies, which are designed for cell selection and activation in cell therapy workflows. Overall, our portfolio of GMP reagents grew over 40%, which resulted in a record revenue quarter. Now let\u2019s shift to our Diagnostics and Genomics segment, which reported 10% organic growth for the quarter. Starting with our spatial biology growth pillar, which includes both our ACD business as well as our Lunaphore acquisition. The single molecule sensitivity, unrivaled specificity and subcellular resolution offered by the RNAScope ISH technology is driving utilization in cancer, neuroscience, immunology, cell and gene therapy and regenerative medicine applications. This broad utilization has enabled RNAScope to become the most referenced spatial biology technology in the industry as the number of our customers publications recently surpassed 10,000. Importantly, over 50% of these publications were released in the last three years as increasing global awareness and expanded market adoption further solidify ACD\u2019s leadership in spatial biology applications. Jumping to a Lunaphore platform. Demand for our fully automated high throughput hyperplex spatial biology platform called Comet once again outpaced our manufacturing capacity in the quarter. However, across divisional project to rapidly scale up Lunaphore\u2019s instrument production capacity is on track to meet current and future platform demand. We also remain on track to launch ACD\u2019s RNAScope HiPlex Pro on the Comet at the end of our current fiscal year. This will enable a novel, highly differentiated multiomic spatial biology platform capable of visualizing up to 12 RNA and 24 protein biomarkers simultaneously in one tissue sample. Moving on to our fourth and final growth pillar, which is the liquid biopsy based molecular diagnostics business. Our ExoDx prostate test provides valuable information on whether a man with a gray-zone PSA score should proceed with an invasive, potentially dangerous prostate biopsy or not. With over 25% volume growth in Q3, the value of this test continues to resonate with both patients and physicians. I\u2019d also like to highlight the continued traction we are experiencing with our surgeon carrier screening and oncology kit business. A surgeon\u2019s ability to solve complex molecular diagnostic challenges continues to resonate with their clinical laboratory partners as growth for this business approached 30% during Q3. Also, we continue to execute on technology synergies within our molecular diagnostics division. We are developing exosome-based single gene mutation tests for monitoring various cancer markets. These kits leverage our ExosomeDx technology and will be distributed through our surgeon laboratory channel. We expect this first monitoring test to be launched in the upcoming quarter. Before I hand the call over to Jim to walk you through the financials in more detail, I would summarize the key takeaways for Q3 as such. Biopharma end markets as well as the China region stabilized relative to the previous quarter and there are early indications that these markets will improve in the back half of the calendar year. Our growth pillars, which are comprised of cell and gene therapy, proteomic analysis solutions, spatial biology technology and our liquid biopsy platform, all continue to outperform the market with their superior portfolio positioning and by the excellent execution of our team. These growth pillars enabled by our leading portfolio of proteomic reagents and assays remain incredibly well positioned to enable our customers to improve the quality of life by catalyzing advances in science and medicine for years to come. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jim. Jim? Jim Hippel : Thank you, Kim. I\u2019ll start with some additional detail on our Q3 financial performance and then give some thoughts on the financial outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. Starting with the overall third quarter financial performance. Adjusted EPS was $0.48 compared to $0.53 in the prior year quarter, with foreign exchange having a material impact on EPS. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.31 compared to $0.43 in the prior year. Q3 revenue was $303.4 million, an increase of 2% year-over-year on an organic basis and a 3% increase on a reported basis. Acquisitions contributed 1% to reported growth. Looking at our organic growth by region and end market in Q3. North America increased low single digits year-over-year, while Europe and China decreased mid-single digits. As Kim mentioned, we noticed an improvement in demand from our biopharma customers, which benefited growth in both our North American and European regions. Overall, Europe had a challenging year-over-year comp as both academic and biopharma increased mid-teens last year. APAC outside of China decreased low single digits overall, with government funding and macro constraints in Japan and South Korea, partially offset by growth in India. For China, the soft government funding environment continued to impact the region. Although the stabilization we experienced in our run rate business in December continued in Q3. This stabilization led to year-over-year growth in our core reagents as well as our spatial biology business in the region. It appears as though the worst of the China slowdown is behind us at this point. And over the long-term, we remain confident that China will still be the fastest-growing major region in the world for life science tools. However, the path back to accelerated growth, we think will take longer than previous down cycles. By end market in Q3, excluding China, biopharma grew low single digits in the quarter, while academic was relatively flat with a challenging double-digit growth comps in Europe. Below revenue on the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin was 71.9% in the quarter, a significant improvement from Q2, but lower than the 72.6% in the same quarter of the prior year. The year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by the impact of the Lunaphore acquisition in this fiscal year. Adjusted SG&A in Q3 was 30.3% of revenue compared to 27.9% in the prior year, while R&D expense in Q3 was 8.5% of revenue compared to 7.7% in the prior year. The increase in SG&A and R&D was driven primarily by the Lunaphore acquisition. Our strategic pricing strategy continues to offset the dollar impact of inflation to operating income, with pricing also largely offsetting the inflationary impact on our operating margin in Q3. Adjusted operating margin for Q3 was 33%, a decrease of 400 basis points from the prior year period but an increase of 290 basis points sequentially. Excluding the Lunaphore acquisition, which closed at the beginning of Q1, adjusted operating margin was 160 basis points lower than the prior year due to the impact of unfavorable volume leverage and to a lesser extent, strategic investments to position the business for future growth. Looking at our numbers below operating income. Net interest expense in Q3 was $3.1 million, increasing $2.9 million compared to the prior year period due to higher debt levels associated with our acquisition of Lunaphore earlier this year. Our bank debt on the balance sheet as of the end of Q3 stood at $389 million, a decrease of $58 million compared to last quarter. Other adjusted non-operating income was $1.6 million in the quarter, an increase of $1.5 million compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting our 20% share of Wilson Wolf\u2019s adjusted net income and the exchange impact related to our cash pooling arrangements. Moving further down the P&L. Our adjusted effective rate in Q3 was 22%, flat sequentially, but up 100 basis points compared to the prior year due to geographic mix. Turning to cash flow and return of capital. $81 million of cash was generated from operations in the quarter and our net investment in capital expenditures was $16.4 million. Also during Q3, we returned capital to shareholders by a way of $12.5 million in dividends. We finished the quarter with $160.5 million average diluted shares outstanding. Our balance sheet finished Q3 in a strong position with approximately $140 million in cash on hand and our total leverage ratio was below 1x EBITDA. Going forward, M&A remains a top priority for capital allocation. Now I\u2019ll discuss the performance of our reporting segments, starting with Protein Sciences. Q3 reported sales were $214.6 million, with reported revenue decreasing 2% compared to the prior year period. As we discussed last quarter, following a strategic review of our portfolio, we have decided to divest the fetal bovine serum or FBS business. FBS has approximately $10 million annual revenue business with an operating margin profile and long-term growth rate below the company average. The exclusion of FBS unfavorably impacted reported segment revenue growth by 1%. Thus, organic revenue decreased 1%. As a reminder, it is our Protein Sciences segment that has the most exposure to the China geographic region as well as to the biotech end market. Operating margin for the Protein Sciences segment was 44.2%, a decrease of 90 basis points compared to the prior year quarter as unfavorable volume and product mix were partially offset by cost management and structural alignment initiatives. On a sequential basis, Protein Sciences segment operating margin increased 390 basis points as a result of these cost initiatives and improved volume leverage. Turning to the Diagnostics and Genomics segment. Q3 sales were $87.5 million, with reported growth increasing 16% compared to the same quarter last year. Organic revenue growth for the segment was 10% with the Lunaphore acquisition having a 6% impact. Growth was solid across the entire segment with our Molecular Diagnostics division leading the way. Moving on to the Diagnostics and Genomics segment operating margin at 9.3%, the segment\u2019s operating margin decreased compared to the prior year\u2019s 15.2% due primarily to the impact of the Lunaphore acquisition. However, Q3 operating margin improved 330 basis points sequentially from Q2, due to improving volume leverage and favorable product mix. As we close out our fiscal year, we expect our Q4 to look similar to our Q3 that just ended with markets remain stable, namely the biotech end market in the China region. Our growth pillars should continue to drive outperformance relative to the overall market with incremental sequential improvement in revenue. With the expectation of incremental revenue in Q4, together with our cost management actions, we should also see incremental improvement in our adjusted operating margins in Q4 relative to Q3. However, we are also facing tougher year-over-year revenue growth comps in Q4 than we did in Q3, especially in China where we grew in the mid-teens in Q4 of last fiscal year. While these more difficult comps may be headwinds to our organic growth in Q4 relative to Q3, we are pleased that the trajectory of the business is improving. As we progress to the end of our fiscal year, we will be monitoring very closely what impact the recent increases in biotech funding as well as the longer-term stimulus announced recently by the Chinese government may have in our fiscal 2025 outlook and operating plans. At our next earnings call, we look forward to updating you on the progress of these green shoots taking root. That concludes my prepared comments. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to the operator to open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Puneet Souda : Hi Kim, Jim, thanks for taking my questions. So first of all, look, congrats on the quarter, and it\u2019s really good to see some recovery here in the core business. But based on what you\u2019re seeing today, I know it\u2019s still a bit nascent, but wondering if, Jim, if we can start to get to potentially sort of high single-digit, if not 10% plus organic growth in fiscal year 2025 as we \u2013 as you turn the chapter here for the next year and comps do get easier as well. So just wondering, when you look at the accounts, what would you like to see in order to potentially see a line of sight to that high single-digit or maybe 10% plus? Jim Hippel : Yes, Puneet, thanks for the question. Like as we said before, you look at our track record, both during the COVID era upswing, but also during last almost a couple of years, what we call the COVID hangover, our organic growth rates have been consistently between 500 basis points to 1,000 basis points better than the overall market when you combine it. And this quarter appears to be no different. And so that gives us confidence in our portfolio, positioning gives us confidence in our team\u2019s execution. And bottom line is that when market returns back to its historical growth rates of mid-single digit, we expect that gap in our performance relative to the market to be at least the same, if not better. So the real question is when do the markets get that mid-single-digit growth? And when they do, we believe we\u2019ll be if not high single-digit, will be well in double-digit kind of growth territory. And that\u2019s an open question. And the analysts and our peers, and we all debate that. But the good news is that there\u2019s green shoots ahead of us as opposed to perceived headwinds. And so that\u2019s exactly why we\u2019ll be monitoring that very closely here as we prepare our own operating plans to prepare for that. But I\u2019m not going to sit here and try to predict exactly when the markets come back to their kind of normal rate. But the sentiment is definitely going to be improving. And at least from the analyst reports that are out there, the dollars seem to be behind it as well. Puneet Souda : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe, Kim, when you look at the biopharma customers, just wondering, I mean, obviously, there\u2019s some excitement with funding in the first quarter. As you look at the early-stage customers as you had the conversations, wondering how much of those dollars could potentially come to the discovery stage where you are more stronger versus the developmental stages of therapeutics. And then on the cell and gene therapy side, could you elaborate a bit more on the 40% growth that you\u2019re seeing in GMP, how sustainable is that, just given the sort of the environment we\u2019re in currently? Kim Kelderman : Yes. Thank you, Puneet. Regarding pharma and the early funding, thank you, you and I have discussed in earlier this quarter, I do believe that funding would be seen to flow through earliest for the consumables part, right? So we do believe that CapEx, larger events will have a little bit longer of a lead time before their fundings flow through. We also do know like we mentioned earlier, that there is a couple of months that we now have seen good funding for the pharma, biopharma areas. And we do know that there\u2019s usually two quarters or so of a delay before that funding flows into the business. I think that overall, this looks very good right now. But as I also mentioned, those are only trends for three months, and we had some disastrous months at the end of the calendar year. So yes, good indication. It looks like a green shoot, looks like things are going up, but it\u2019s early days, and therefore, we want to be careful that prognosis. The cell and gene therapy, it has been outpacing our overall company\u2019s growth for a long time. I think it\u2019s a very strong product line as are all four of our verticals. And I think that we are having a great opportunity there. We have the best reagents to place in that space. And as you know, we have a real good opportunity to consolidate all our reagents into the GRx [ph] for the cell and gene therapy space. So we\u2019re very bullish on it. We do know that some of these quarters can be very \u2013 can be a little bit lumpy because of the larger orders from the companies that are food in their pipeline and that really can make a quarter swing. However, we saw really strong growth in the earlier-stage companies. And that will give us a better foundation because if more of these 400 customers or so that we have started ordering earlier in their pipelines that will give us a more stable foundation to continue to put up great numbers. But for now, we are, of course, very encouraged with our play in cell and gene therapy and are very glad to see here some momentum building in that end market. Operator : Thank you. Mr. Souda please rejoin the queue for more questions. Next question comes from the line of Jacob Johnson with Stephens Inc. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning. This is Mac on for Jacob. Just a few quick ones for me. I appreciate the commentary around biopharma in China. There\u2019s been some muted commentary from most of your peers recently, but also the prospect around the stimulus that you mentioned earlier. So I\u2019m curious as to what you\u2019re watching for to signal an improved backdrop in that country at this point in time? Kim Kelderman : Yes. Thanks, Mac. As you know, we are big believers of the situation in China improving over time and that this will be as it used to be a true growth driver for the business. As you know, we also had three real tough quarters in China right now, and that\u2019s mainly paced by the lack of funding. We do hear there also some green shoots of funding efforts. And yes, we are keeping our eye to the floor there that the momentum will continue build, specifically for instrumentation. We know that the $70 billion funding that\u2019s laid out or the loan that the government is laying out is aimed at improving and innovating the instrumentation base. And we think we can benefit from that funding. And in the meantime, we hear positive \u2013 positivity from our sales force. They talk to their customers and the customers are getting more interested about hearing the benefits our automation brings. And our automation brings consistency, it\u2019s very efficient and it\u2019s got fast results. So that value proposition fits really, really well with the new funding potentially flowing through into China. Unidentified Analyst : And then just quickly, is there anything that you think you need to change or could change to better capitalize on opportunities in the current environment? Or as it relates to your go-to-market strategy? Or do you think a reacceleration in growth largely depends on the macro environment? Kim Kelderman : Yes, I think it\u2019s the latter. The \u2013 it\u2019s clear that we have a very efficient sales force in China. We\u2019ve always done really well in the region. We feel we have the right coverage, direct versus indirect. And I think that we\u2019ve got the right product positioning. In addition to that, we are, as you know, investing in China for China GMP plant, which will also come in line over the coming quarters. And with that, I think we have the right portfolio, the right value proposition as well as the right go-to-market channels. So I\u2019m very happy with the situation that we currently have there. Operator : Thank you. Mr. Johnson [ph], please rejoin the queue for more questions. Next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Please go ahead. Patrick Donnelly : Hey guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just one for you, Jim, just on the guidance piece. Can you talk about the margin side? It sounds like up sequentially, maybe in that mid-30s range for 4Q. Is that the right number to build off of as you think about next year? And then I just wanted to clarify on the revenue side? Is it the dollars are up sequentially in 4Q and the growth rate is similar to this 2% organic. I just want to make sure I have that right. Jim Hippel : Yes, sure. Thanks, Patrick. So first on the margin question. We talked about for a couple of quarters now that our goal was to get that to mid-30s type margin by the time we exit this fiscal year. It\u2019s not a slam dunk to do that. We still got a ways to go to get from 33 [ph] to that point, but it\u2019s not out of reach at this point. So I think, honestly, where the consensus has us right now feels about right for Q4, which gives us a nice launching pad into fiscal year 2025. And it\u2019s really going to depend on the revenue where the markets are and what \u2013 I\u2019ve already talked about our expectation of growth above and beyond the market growth. So as you saw from Q2 to Q3, the amount of margin expansion we had on the increased volume and much of that is seasonal. We have amazing pull-through, amazing gross margins in our products. So when you get that volume it contributes tremendously to the bottom line. And of course, we continue to invest because we\u2019re investing for the long term. We\u2019ve got these amazing growth pillars that we have to continue to kind of feed those bees so they can reach their full potential five years, 10 years down the road. So we\u2019ll be balancing that as we go through our operating plan this year and look forward to providing you some more insight to that next call. With regards to the revenue question, to be clear, have clarity on that. As I mentioned, we do believe that revenues will be slightly higher in Q4 than Q3. But the organic growth percentage year-over-year might be a bit challenged, mainly because of the tough comp we have in China. If you think about China last year, we had mid-teens growth versus where it\u2019s running right now, being 8% to 10% of our business, that\u2019s up 1.5 points of headwind just in itself. So that\u2019s kind of where we\u2019re at right now in terms of the range of organic growth. Patrick Donnelly : Okay. Understood. And then, Kim, maybe just on \u2013 I think it was last week, you guys announced the expanded Fisher agreement into Europe. Can you just talk about the opportunity there, how impactful that could be as we work our way to 2025 for you guys? Just trying to wrap my head around that agree. Kim Kelderman : Yes. Thank you, Patrick. Thermo Fisher Scientific has a ton of capabilities, but one of the big ones is the Fisher Scientific channels, and that channel provides great reach and ease of use for transactions for our customers. As you might know, we\u2019ve had a distribution agreement, a very similar one in the U.S. since 2014, so for about 10 years now. And we\u2019re very, very comfortable and used to collaborating with the Fisher channel. I can expect a similar trend and a similar setup in Europe, where our European customers can benefit from the commercial footprint, the reach and also the ease of transactions that come with dealing with the Fisher Scientific channel. And of course, this convenience and this reach is very important for us as well. And therefore, we can \u2013 we hope that we can serve our customers better. Nonetheless, of course, Bio-Techne will maintain and grow our direct channels as we have done in the U.S.A. as well. And we will make sure that we fine-tune and work really well together with the Fisher channel and collaborate to eventually optimize our customers\u2019 convenience and the reach we have as a company. Operator : Thank you. Mr. Donnelly, please rejoin the queue for more questions. Next question comes from the line of Justin Bowers with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Justin Bowers : Hi. Good morning. I just want to pivot back to the cell and gene end market and the strength there. Can you talk about sort of what you\u2019re seeing in that customer cohort? And is the durability of that growth over the next couple of quarters, supported by existing programs and customers? Or do you need to see sort of new customer activity? Or is that just sort of like greenfield for you on the go forward? Kim Kelderman : Yes. Thank you, Justin, for the question. As I mentioned earlier, I think our cell and gene therapy play is just very strong because of the different products we sell into it, right? As you know, we have a 20% stake in Wilson Wolf, and Wilson Wolf have this GRx, which is a container that makes it really easy and efficient to grow \u2013 to grow T cells. To grow these T cells, you would need our core products. So we have our GMP proteins, cytokines, chemokines to make sure that you can fine-tune the growth of these T cells. And these are all very high-value ingredients to the cell and gene therapy market. We do know that, for example, the GRx is in about half let\u2019s say, 45% of all the clinical trials that are going on in this space, we know that we are obviously very keen on making sure that all our ingredients are being used in that setup just as well. So we create the pull-through. We\u2019ve seen fantastic growth in our GMP proteins and that are now on basing at an annualized revenue of about $60 million. And yes, we\u2019re very proud that we had a record quarter. As I mentioned earlier, it can be a little lumpy because they are the larger customers that are in the back end of their clinicals where volumes go higher, and that will create some variation of results quarter-over-quarter. But overall, we have seen consistent very high growth within this space. And we know that more and more companies are entering the race because cell and gene therapy has been shown to be able to cure diseases we previously not have been able to find any solutions for us, so we\u2019re very excited about this space. Justin Bowers : Okay. So it sounds like increased pull-through and scaling up? And then on Wilson Wolf what are trends like there? Is that still stable? Or is it starting to grow again? Any commentary there would be helpful? Kim Kelderman : Yes, Wilson Wolf, as I mentioned, participate in 45% of all the clinicals. There are several of these companies that we collaborate with that have now reached the finish line and are commercializing, which is a very good indication, and we\u2019re over half of those. And then last but not least, overall, the company started growing again in double digits, it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s sitting this quarter in around 14%, and it has a fantastic run rate. And as you can imagine, really, really high margins north of 72%, and yes, we\u2019re very, very happy to see that Wilson Wolf is having such traction in this important market, specifically because we know that Bio-Techne will definitely benefit from it with our reagent. But also over time, we will own the company, and we will then have the data benefit as well. Operator : Thank you. Mr. Bowers, please rejoin the queue for more questions. Next question comes from the line of Dan Arias with Stifel. Please go ahead. Dan Arias : Hey, good morning guys. Thanks. Kim, on the spatial business, what do you see as the time line for getting production on Comet? Where it needs to be in order to meet demand? And then it\u2019s firming up the manufacturing plan and you\u2019re getting ready to pay ACD and Lunaphore. Can you just maybe refresh the view on what you think the spatial portfolio should grow at going forward? Kim Kelderman : Yes. Thank you, Dan. The production constraints are really, really facing the output right now. We are really happy, first and foremost, that we see the demand that we would like, right, and then actually exceeding expectations. So that\u2019s the most important fundamental. We do believe that during this quarter, the quarter we\u2019re currently in that we will get very close to what our book is. But the real status quo where we can produce as many Comets as that get ordered will be in our first fiscal year quarter. So the third calendar quarter and then we will continue to reel in the backlog in the first half of our fiscal year. You asked about my enthusiasm in spatial, it\u2019s huge. Obviously, it\u2019s a very fast-growing market, and you\u2019ve been \u2013 you\u2019ve gotten used to ACD being a real winner in the reagent space, with all the benefits that we know about it. And then Comet, it\u2019s early days. But if we compare the system to other peer systems in the field, we know that Comet is the only instrument that has a full workflow automation, right? So there\u2019s no manual interference or manual steps in the workflow. The Comet you can use any antibodies that you\u2019ve used to utilize in your workflow. We have 50,000 RNA targets, a truly multiomic machine. So you can see your protein and your RNA targets sanely in the same slide. As you know, Bio-Techne has 400,000 antibodies. So there\u2019s plenty of choice to pick from in order to boost our pull-through on the instrument. And as you know, we can run four slides in parallel, and there we have the highest throughput in the market. So I\u2019m extremely pleased with our positioning from a reagent as well as from an automation point of view, and we will continue to work to make our reagents, our antibodies as what the system seamlessly working together from some preparation [ph] all the way to image analysis to eventually make it most convenient for our customers to perform their special biology test. Dan Arias : Okay. And then, Jim, just maybe to round out your comments related to the finish to the fiscal year here. You touched on margins. I just wanted to ask about the top line. It sounds like you\u2019re expecting similar conditions, but you have the slightly tougher comp overall, China notably hard. Does that translate to some modest growth in 4Q? What\u2019s the outlook there? Jim Hippel : Yes, we\u2019re absolutely \u2013 we absolutely are helping on \u2013 stay in the black for sure, so in terms of growth. Operator : Thank you. Mr. Arias, please rejoin the queue for more questions. Next question comes from the line of Matt Larew with William Blair. Please go ahead. Matt Larew : Hi. Good morning. I wanted to follow-up on Lunaphore. And the investments you\u2019re making today to scale up manufacturing, would you say that generally they\u2019re within the bounds of what you expected to make just perhaps they\u2019re pulled forward? Or I guess the flip side of that would be; do you have different or worse expectations about the long-term margin potential. So just trying to get a sense for whether this is scale up to meet accelerated demand or perhaps something you discovered once you did the deal? Kim Kelderman : That was a very good question, Matt. No, fortunately, it\u2019s not something we discovered. It\u2019s truly an outpacing of the orders versus our initial projections. And we had lofty projections but the traction in the market is just overwhelming. And that means that we have to increase our in-house capacity, which, of course, is something that we\u2019re very used to do. We have a fantastic operations team in Switzerland that gets supported by operations teams from the U.S. just as well and from across other businesses such as the ProteinSimple business, very much used to producing high-volume instrumentation. So I\u2019m very confident we can increase that capacity. But as you can imagine, the pull-through also hit some of the vendors. So also there, we have to make sure that we help out with the upscaling of certain critical parts that the vendors are having to get used to these new volumes, right? So overall, we just have to beef up the capacity. It\u2019s a great thing. By now, it\u2019s a good problem to have, and we\u2019re very confident that we can resolve this and there is no other underlying constrained or issue that we are aware of. Matt Larew : Okay. That\u2019s great to hear. The next question is about ScaleReady and the components of that. So your own GMP protein business, partnership and Wilson Wolf; just curious now that it\u2019s been out there for a little while. What kind of feedback you\u2019ve been getting if there\u2019s any way to talk about how that\u2019s translated to win rates? Is that a driver of some of the pickup in GMP proteins? And obviously, Wilson Wolf has been some market leading technology. I think there probably is some looming competition out there. Beyond just integration to offer a more full and automated solution like you\u2019re trying to do already, are there also additional areas for platform improvement with GRx or that broader suite as well? Kim Kelderman : Yes. Thank you for the question. I just have to say that when I talk to our customers in the cell and gene therapy space, ScaleReady has a real good reputation. So it\u2019s truly a brand now in that particular space. And of course, it has a full solution for cell and gene therapy customers. And that\u2019s why I believe that you see such traction in not only the volume of the G-Rex and the revenue associated with it, but also in the pull-through of proteins the cytokines and chemokines that we \u2013 customers end up using in that setup. It\u2019s a complete solution. It\u2019s scalable, and it\u2019s relatively easy to implement compared to some of the competitive workflows. And yes, I think that is a chicken and the egg, right? ScaleReady is doing really well because that\u2019s a fantastic solution. And the other way around, the customers do get to enjoy the solution because the ScaleReady team is really efficient in bringing it to market and educating our customers about the benefit of the solution we have. Operator : Thank you. Mr. Larew, please rejoin the queue for more questions. Next question comes from the line of Catherine Schulte with Baird. Please go ahead Catherine Schulte : Hey guys, thanks for the questions. Organic growth came in about four points better than what you\u2019ve guided. You talked about China stabilizing, but that sounded like it played out as you expected. So can you just talk through what drove that upside versus your expectations? Was it really broad-based? Or was there a particular product category or end market that\u2019s surprised? Jim Hippel : Yes. Hi, Catherine, this is Jim. Thanks for the question. Yes. I mean, I think generally speaking, the broad-based market performed as we expected. As you mentioned, China overall those as we expected as well. I think there is \u2013 if you look within the Protein Sciences, it gets back to our growth pillars and how resilient they are even in this down cycle we\u2019ve been in. So a two point I\u2019d call out would be one was cell and gene therapy. So we always said that when biotech funding came back, we believe that cell and gene therapy will be one of the first places you\u2019d see it. And I\u2019m not saying there\u2019s a direct correlation there, but definitely a positive sign. And it was a bit of a surprise for us how quickly cell and therapy rebounded for us here in the third quarter. And again, we saw the same thing over, as Kim mentioned, in Wilson Wolf as well. So that was very encouraging. It was not necessarily in our outlook a quarter ago. The other growth pillar within Protein Sciences was within our instrument, proteomics instrument portfolio and even more specifically, Simple Western. Simple Western performed extremely well and actually grew double digit in instruments as well as consumables. So also a very good sign because we always figured that when the instrument market came back, that would be the first part of our portfolio that we would see it given it\u2019s a broad base of applications. It\u2019s also very used widely in cell and gene therapy, and it\u2019s very the most underpenetrated of our three platforms. So that was not necessarily in our outlook a quarter ago, and it was very nice to see that come back so strong here this quarter. And then if I turn over to our diagnostics and genomics business, there is, I\u2019d call out the surgeon business. As we talked about the growth rates there, we\u2019re pretty much nearing our EPI test with Exosome. And \u2013 so very \u2013 one of the highest growth rates we\u2019ve seen with the surgeon since we\u2019ve owned the company and they got some new product launches out there are performing extremely well, and we think that momentum will continue. So that was also very nice to see. Catherine Schulte : All right, great. Thank you. And then was there any stocking contribution from the European Fisher deal in the quarter? Or will there be any in the fiscal fourth quarter just given the timing of when you signed \u2013 just curious if there\u2019s any stocking related to that partnership. Kim Kelderman : Catherine, thank you for the question. No, there were no such influences in this past quarter and don\u2019t expect them in the next quarter either, specifically because the setup is that Fisher will bring in the leads, and we will ship directly from our warehouse. So you will not see any of those dynamics, if that makes sense. Operator : Thank you. Ms. Schulte, please rejoin the queue for more questions. Next question comes from the line of Sung Ji Nam with Scotia Bank. Please go ahead Sung Ji Nam : Hi, thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the quarter. Maybe just on the academic end market perspective at this juncture. Just kind of curious, if you guys have visibility into that market, especially in the U.S. and Europe. Obviously, you\u2019re seeing continued stable growth there, but potentially more difficult comps ahead. So just kind of curious what your outlook might be for the coming quarters. Kim Kelderman : Yes. I think that academic markets have \u2013 we\u2019ve done pretty well in there. And overall, I must say we see a relatively stable environment, right, with the Horizon funding in Europe as well as in the U.S. So it\u2019s a stable market. Of course, with the lull in the biotech industry, some of our innovative sales reps have found their way into some of the academic accounts as well and have started refocusing there. So there is a nice bump up for us by just having the right focus and the connections further developing between the customers in academic as well as the sales rep. So at the end of the day, I think this is not a something that is just for one quarter or two quarters. I think as long as the academic funding stays as it is or gets better, we will continue to see a benefit from that end market, and we will continue to be good or even better at serving it. So \u2013 and that\u2019s what I expect for the coming quarters. Sung Ji Nam : Got it. And then I also have a follow-up on Lunaphore and spatial bio. Just kind of curious, it may be early, but are you seeing competitive wins on Lunaphore currently? And just for the spatial bio addressable market in general, just kind of curious what\u2019s driving the \u2013 other than your performance there, just from an end market standpoint, are there a disproportional funding going towards your addressable market, current environment, do you think? Or \u2013 just kind of any color would be great. Thank you. Kim Kelderman : Yes. Thanks for your question around spatial biology end markets. I do believe that end market is under less pressure than other end markets. It\u2019s just such an important tool into determining which biomarker you\u2019re going after. It\u2019s just a new way of doing your research and validating your results. So it\u2019s here to stay, and that market will continue to grow significantly, and we believe that it will grow double digits for the foreseeable future. Yes, we see competitive wins, as I mentioned earlier, when Dan asked the question, there are tremendous benefits from a Comet automation system over other systems that are in the market are reagents, their antibodies are also in the lead and very unique in that market. So that combination is just very strong. And if I look at some of the trends in the market, yes, we have been able to sell Comets into accounts that have experience with other systems. But an even stronger signal is the moment we found that customers want a second Comet, right? And then now we have several larger pharma companies that have ordered the third one. So that means it\u2019s not only a good value proposition at the moment you buy it, but it\u2019s still a really good value proposition the moment you use it, and that gives them real first-hand experience, and that gives me confidence that, that workflow is indeed a real strong value position compared to the other solutions in the market. Operator : Thank you. Ms. Ji Nam [ph], please rejoin the queue for more questions. Next question comes from the line of Paul Knight with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead Paul Knight : Hi, yes Kim, thanks for the time and Jim as well. The Protein Simple business, could you kind of highlight one of the fastest-growing portions of the product line. How large is Protein Simple now as well? And just a refresh there would be great. Jim Hippel : Yes. Paul, this is Jim. So thanks for the question. Good to hear from you. Not given the size of so much on the by product line anymore. We try to avoid that from a competitive perspective. But as I highlighted in earlier \u2013 as an answer to earlier question, I think the Simple Western platform specifically was a highlight of that portfolio this quarter with double-digit growth overall and double-digit growth in both instrument placements as well as consumables. That being said, our entire instrument portfolio has been very resilient through this downturn. Despite struggles with the instrument placements the last several quarters, the consumables on all three platforms continue to offset that to keep those product lines in a very stable state overall. So we\u2019re very pleased with how those \u2013 our instrument portfolio has performed and gives us that kind of great confidence that when the market normal, as no [ph] markets normalize, we\u2019ll see accelerated growth in that portfolio once again. Paul Knight : And then you mentioned in the past potential revenue, the GMP facility or maybe expressed as capacity and dollar revenue. Where are you \u2013 where is your thinking now on capacity of your GMP business? Jim Hippel : Capacity is not \u2013 yes, capacity is no longer an issue. We\u2019re probably stop talking about it because I think we have capacity could last as a decade or more, to be honest with you at least as it pertains to our GMP proteins for the CAR-T for the immunotherapy market. We still have some capacity that we need to build out for our regenerative medicine side of our \u2013 the GMP protein business. But as it pertains to what that facility was specifically built for, which is the immunotherapy side of cell therapy market. Capacity will not be an issue for a decade or more to come. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the floor over to Kim Kelderman for closing comments. Kim Kelderman : Yes. Thank you, and thank you, everybody, for joining the call today and for the insightful questions. I\u2019m extremely proud of the Bio-Techne team\u2019s accomplishments in this dynamic environment, and I\u2019m also proud of the results we\u2019ve been able to deliver in this quarter. Our differentiated portfolio addresses some of the highest growth markets in life sciences and is positioned to deliver best-in-class performance, for all our stakeholders going forward. Thank you very much for joining the call. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

I will now turn the call over to Kim. Kim Kelderman : Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter conference call. I'm pleased to report that our fourth quarter results came in, in line with our initial expectations. Continued stabilization of our end markets, combined with excellent execution by the Bio-Techne team, led to a 1% year-over-year organic revenue growth. This quarter wraps up our fiscal 2024, where our core portfolio of research and diagnostic reagents, together with the four growth verticals that leverage this content, delivered a 1% growth is what has proven to be a challenging fiscal year. It's worth noting that these growth verticals have enabled Bio-Techne to consistently outperform our peer group during this unprecedented post-COVID pandemic period. During this period, we experienced a challenging funding environment for biotech and a significant R&D budget recalibration by large pharma and academia customers. Let me give you some examples of the business dynamics we've experienced throughout our fiscal year. First, proteomics analytical franchise, branded ProteinSimple. This business provides productivity tools for laboratories commonly used to expand laboratory capacity. However, these products are also well positioned for customers that are operating under constraint budgets and are looking to replace manual processes with simple and effective automation. Here, we saw mid single-digit growth for the fiscal year, led by Simple Plex and Simple Western platforms, bolstered by double-digit growth for instrument-related consumables across all platforms. Our cell and gene therapy vertical, which is led by our quality GMP protein products, also grew mid single-digits for the year and added more customers even while biotech funding had a multiyear low. In our spatial biology vertical, we saw solid growth in fiscal year 2024 despite the budget reset by our pharma customers. Our new spatial biology instrument COMET is seeing a robust adoption and will bring accelerated growth to this vertical in the years ahead. And last, the ongoing traction and market adoption of our ExoDx Prostate test, together with new product launch within our surging franchise, drove double-digit growth in our Molecular Diagnostics growth vertical all year long. It is these four growth verticals that have carried us to the challenging post-COVID dynamic market slowdown, and we are confident that these same verticals will drive accelerated growth as our core market and our core portfolio of 40 agents gradually recover back to long-term historical growth rate. Over the last 48 years, we've mapped the core portfolio of research reagents and diagnostic tools, which include a catalog of over 6,000 protein and 400,000 antibody types. These products are critical components to many foundational workflows, and virtually all life science academic and biopharma research labs globally. Not only do the reagents unlock the power of scientific discovery, they are also the synergistic force behind our four growth verticals. The five-year CAGR for these growth verticals is over 20%, and they accounted for about 45% of Bio-Techne's revenue in fiscal 2024, which is significantly higher than the 30% of revenue in fiscal 2019. And that's only five years ago. Before we get into the details of the most recent quarter, I'd like to officially welcome Dr. Judith Klimovsky to Bio-Techne's Board of Directors. Dr. Klimovsky is currently the Executive Vice President and Chief Development Officer at Genmab, and she brings a significantly end market, scientific and international experience to Bio-Techne's Board. Dr. Klimovsky's insight and guidance will be very beneficial as we continue to execute our strategy and expand globally. Welcome to our Board, Judith. Now let's start with a discussion of our end markets and geographies, beginning with the biopharma end market, where we saw continued stabilization from our biopharma customers. Overall, biopharma, declined to low single-digits in the quarter, it was relatively consistent on a sequential basis. There is a broad awareness that biotech funding has been stronger for the first half of the calendar year, which is good news after a very challenging 2023. We anticipate that this recovery will bring incremental confidence to the capital-dependent companies and that this will eventually drive increased demand for our portfolio with life science products in the coming quarters. Academia decreased low single-digits in the quarter, reflecting a particularly challenging comparison with the same period last year during which revenue increased upper single-digits. From a geographic perspective, North America and Europe both declined low single-digits in the quarter, reflecting the aforementioned constraints in biopharma and academic end markets. Although it is worth noting that Europe had particularly difficult comparables and that it had double-digit growth in the fourth quarter last year. For China, the stabilization trend that we have experienced over the past several quarters fortunately continued into Q4. As China progressed through a recovery process, we would expect a portfolio of research and reagents to be in the first to return to growth, followed by our instrument portfolio. This prognosis strengthened by the fact that our team in China delivered their second consecutive quarter of double-digit growth for our core reagent portfolio. This performance was paired with mid single-digit growth in our biologics portfolio, which consists primarily of the Maurice family of instruments and associated consumables. Overall, China declined high single-digits in the fourth quarter, which was in line with our expectations at last year's stimulus resulted in a comp of mid-teens growth for this geography in last year's Q4. While the impact of the recently announced stimulus will likely not translate into revenue growth for the region until the second half of our fiscal year, we are encouraged by the overall stabilization in this region and the early return of the growth to our reagents. And let's discuss our growth pillars in more detail, starting with ProteinSimple instrumentation within the Protein Sciences segment, where overall organic growth was low single-digit for the quarter. As mentioned, robust utilization of these productivity tools drove double-digit consumable growth. It's worth highlighting that our Q4 is the 7th consecutive quarter in which the consumables related to our instruments grew at least double-digits, which indicates strong utilization of our global installed base. A protein analysis instrument provide automation, decision, reproducibility and labor savings, which makes them increasingly ingrained in both academic and biopharma workflows. Our automated multiplexing immunoassay instrument named Ella was a standout performer within the ProteinSimple portfolio as both the instrument and related consumables increased double-digits in the quarter. Ella is quickly becoming the go-to platform for cell and gene therapy customers for viral titer and release testing. Ella also seeing rapid adoption among CROs looking for high reproducibility paired with high sensitivity in an easy-to-use, fully automated immunoassay platform. Related to immunoassay technology, we recently announced an investment in Spear Bio\u2019s Series A funding plan. Spear Bio is an innovation leader in the development and manufacturer of ultrasensitive immunoassays capable of measuring protein markers at automolar levels from sub microliter sample volumes. Spear Bio\u2019s assays run on qPCR equipment, which is routinely found in research and clinical facilities therewith tapping into very broad existing installed base. Spear Bio\u2019s initial assay will focus on key biomarkers supporting translational research in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Within our protein simple franchise, we also recently announced the latest addition to our Simple Western platforms called Leo. As a reminder, our Simple Western platforms automate the manual, laborious, cumbersome, time consuming and inconsistent western blotting process that is commonly used to identify proteins in complex mixtures. Leo is the high throughput automated western blot system enabling the simultaneous analysis up to 100 samples in a single 3 hour run. We are excited to introduce this next-generation system, which is expected to begin shipping in the second half of our fiscal year 2025. We remain the only fully automated western blot technology provider on the market and see a long runway for the future growth with this portfolio as our current market penetration is below 30%. Like our other platforms, Simple Western continues to gain traction in cell and gene therapy application as the system is increasingly used for absolute protein quantitation and relative potency assay. For example, Regulus Therapeutics recently reported positive top line data from the second cohort of patients in its Phase 1b study related to the treatment of a kidney disease called ADPKD. Regulus utilized our Simple Western platform to develop high performance biomarker assays to measure various proteins in urine as part of this study. We look forward to working with Regulus and of course with all our other partners to further the advancement of cell and gene therapy. I\u2019ll now shift to the other growth pillars within our Protein Science segment, our own cell and gene therapy business unit. This growth vertical includes a proteomic reagent and scalable workflow solutions that enable our customers to accelerate e-clinical, clinical and eventually the commercialization of these next-generation therapeutics. As we\u2019ve mentioned in the past, order timing from large customers can create quarter-to-quarter lumpiness in our GMP proteins business and that was indeed the case in our Q4. As a sign of underlying strength, however, we are pleased to see continued growth in the number of customers utilizing our highly active GMP protein. We will continue to actively seed the market to ensure we partner with our customers early in their development journey. Within our GMP reagent offering, we continue to drive significant growth within our GMP small molecules business. These small molecules are key components in the reprogramming, self-renewal, storage and differentiation processes that are key to regenerative medicine workflows. We are making good progress with our new GMP facility in Bristol, UK, which positions us well to meet current and forecasted demand for those critical reagents. This small molecule business grew nearly 50% for the quarter and is quickly becoming a material contributor to our overall cell and gene therapy results. In total, our Protein Science segment declined 3% organically for the quarter and declined 2% for the fiscal year. Remember that our Protein Science segment is where we have the most exposure to both China and the biopharma end market, and that this segment is positioned to see the most significant improvement as these end markets start to recover. Now, let\u2019s discuss the growth pillars in our Diagnostics and Genomics segment where organic revenue grew by 9% in the quarter and 6% for the full fiscal year. Our molecular diagnostics growth pillar performed exceptionally well as organic revenue growth topped 20%. The value proposition of our ExoDx Prostate test continues to resonate with both patients and physicians. It does provides critical information to men with a gray zone PSA score on whether to proceed or not to proceed with an invasive and potentially dangerous prostate biopsy. During Q4, ExoDx Prostate volumes increased by almost 35%. We are seeing momentum across the various KPIs we track for our ExoDx Prostate test, including a 30% sequential increase in the number of physicians ordering 25 or more ExoDx Prostate tests per quarter. Rounding out molecular diagnostics business, the Asuragen brand delivered another strong quarter as the sensitivity and specificity of our proprietary assay chemistry drives global adoption of our carrier screening as well as our oncology kit. This led to mid-teens overall growth for the business and we continue to advance to innovative molecular diagnostic products through our pipeline and are looking forward to the launch of our exosome based ESR1 mutation kit for breast cancer monitoring as well as the expanded carrier screening essay in the coming months. Now let\u2019s discuss our spatial biology growth pillar where once again, demand for a fully automated high throughput hyperplex spatial biology platform called Comet outpaced our manufacturing capacity in the quarter. The cross organizational manufacturing team continues to implement production process improvements and is making good progress scaling capacity to meet current and forecasted Comet demand. During the quarter, we enabled RNA detection and visualization on Comet with the launch of RNAscope HiPlex capabilities for the instrument. Following this launch, Comet is now capable of detecting and visualizing up to 24 plate proteins and 12 RNA targets simultaneously, creating a highly differentiated multiomic system for the rapidly growing spatial biology market. These enhanced capabilities are in the hands of our initial set of key opinion leaders and will be rolling out across our installed base over the coming months. In summary, the team delivered another solid quarter and another solid fiscal year in this challenging funding environment. As our end markets equilibrate back to a non-pandemic environment, we are well positioned to reinvigorate growth across our portfolio of core research reagent and continued momentum across our four growth verticals. I\u2019m extremely proud of the execution by the Bio-Techne team in the stabilizing but still challenging end market. I\u2019m also confident in our ability to deliver differentiated financial performance as our end markets progress through the recovery process. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jim. Jim? Jim Hippel : Thanks, Kim. I\u2019ll start with some additional detail on our Q4 and fiscal 2024 financial performance and then give some thoughts on the financial outlook for the year ahead. Starting with the overall fourth quarter financial performance. Adjusted EPS was $0.49 compared to $0.55 in the prior year quarter, with foreign exchange having immaterial impact on EPS. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.25 compared to $0.47 in the prior year. Q4 revenue was $306.1 million, an increase of 2% year-over-year on a reported basis, a 1% increase on an organic basis. Acquisitions contributed 1% to reported growth. The full fiscal year 2024 revenue approached $1.2 billion and organic growth was comparable to what we saw in the fourth quarter. Looking at our organic growth by region and end market. In Q4, North America and Europe decreased low single digits year-over-year, while China decreased high single digits. APAC outside of China increased low double digits overall, with Japan and Australia both benefiting from growth in cell and gene therapy and regional expansion of our Asuragen portfolio, respectfully. While lower government funding and macro constraints continue to impact South Korea. By end market in Q4, excluding China, both biopharma and academia declined low single digits in the quarter. As Kim previously mentioned, we continue to see sequential global stability in our biopharma end market and academia faced tougher year-over-year comps this quarter. Below revenue on the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin was 71.1% in the quarter compared to 71.6% in the same quarter the prior year, driven by the impact of the Lunaphore acquisition and unfavorable product mix, partially offset by productivity initiatives. Adjusted SG&A in Q4 was 29.8% of revenue compared to 26.8% in the prior year, while R&D expense in Q4 was 7.8% of revenue consistent with the prior year. The increase in SG&A was driven primarily by the Lunaphore acquisition as well as the quarterly timing of annual incentive compensation accruals. Adjusted operating margin for Q4 was 33.5%, a decrease of 360 basis points from the prior year period, but an increase of 50 basis points sequentially. Excluding the Lunaphore acquisition, which closed at the beginning of Q1, adjusted operating margin was 120 basis points lower than the prior year due to the impact of unfavorable volume leverage and product mix. Looking at our numbers below operating income, net interest expense in Q4 was $1.5 million, decreasing $1 million compared to the prior year period due to lower debt levels. Our bank debt on the balance sheet as of the end of Q4 stood at $319 [ph] million, a decrease of $70 million compared to last quarter. Other adjusted non-operating income was $0.5 million in the quarter, an increase of $0.6 million compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting our 20% share of Wilson Wolf adjusted net income, partially offset by the foreign exchange impact related to our cash pooling arrangements. Moving further down the P&L, our adjusted effective tax rate in Q4 was 22%, consistent throughout fiscal 2024, but up 200 basis points compared to the prior year due to geographic mix. Turning to cash flow and return of capital, $75.5 million of cash was generated from operations in the quarter, and our net investment in capital expenditures was $18 million. Also during Q4, we returned capital to shareholders by way of $12.6 million in dividends. We finished the quarter with 160.7 million average diluted shares outstanding. Our balance sheet finished Q4 in a strong position with $151.8 million in cash and our total leverage ratio remains well below 1x EBITDA. Going forward, M&A remains the top priority for capital allocation. Now let\u2019s discuss the performance of our reporting segments, starting with the Protein Sciences segment. Q4 reported sales were $214 million, which reported revenue decreasing 4% compared to the prior year period. As discussed in last quarter\u2019s call, on a strategic review of our portfolio, we have decided to invest the fetal bovine serum or FBS business. FBS is approximately $10 million annual revenue business with an operating margin profile and long-term growth rate below the company average. The exclusion of FBS unfavorably impacted reported segment revenue growth by 1%. Thus, organic revenue for the segment decreased 3%. As a reminder, it is our Protein Sciences segment that has the most exposure to the China geographic region as well as to the biotech end market. Operating margin for the Protein Sciences segment was 43%, a decrease of 170 basis points compared to the prior year quarter as unfavorable volume and product mix were partially offset by cost management and structural alignment initiatives. Now turning to the Diagnostics and Genomics segment, Q4 sales were $90.7 million, with reported growth increasing 15% compared to the same quarter last year. Organic revenue growth for the segment was 9% with the Lunaphore acquisition having a 6% impact. Lunaphore [ph] diagnostics growth vertical once again led segment growth. Moving on to the Diagnostics and Genomics segment operating margin at 12.5%. The segment\u2019s operating margin decreased compared to the prior year\u2019s 18.5%, due primarily to the impact of the Lunaphore acquisition. Excluding Lunaphore, the segment\u2019s operating margin would have been over 20%. Diagnostics and Genomics steadily improved operating margins throughout fiscal 2024, benefiting from the integration of Lunaphore and sequentially increasing volume leverage. The segment\u2019s operating margin improved 320 basis points sequentially from Q3 and improved from nearly breakeven operating margin at the beginning of the year in Q1. In summary, as we reflect on this past fiscal year, it has really been a multiyear unwinding of a massive investment that occurred in our industry and end markets during the COVID pandemic. We are pleased that our strategic portfolio positioning, together with a resilient execution by our 3,100 employees, has enabled Bio-Techne\u2019s annual revenue to be higher today than it was before the unwinding began. We are encouraged that the past two quarters of sequential stabilization in our end markets suggest that the unwinding is largely behind us. Now our industry waits for a return to normalized market growth, which were life sciences, we believe, is mid-single-digit growth over the long term. How long will it take for this recovery to happen is a challenge for anyone to predict. But there are indications that a gradual recovery in the back half of calendar year 2024 and throughout calendar 2025 is a real possibility. These indications include the following. OEM customer destocking appears to have abated. Biotech funding in the first half of calendar year 2024 has improved significantly from 2023 levels. Large pharma customers may have completed the realignment of their R&D pipeline priorities by the end of calendar 2024 with the pandemic now in the rearview mirror and the implications of new pharma industry-specific government regulation better understood. And finally, the China region should realize a lift in instrument growth at the start of calendar 2025 due to government stimulus that has been announced. As our end markets gradually recover, we believe that biotech needs relative revenue growth. Outperformance will also continue. Value proposition at our proteomic analysis platforms have demonstrated to our customers during this downturn has resonated in strong instrument-based consumable growth the past two years. And by our calculation, there is pent-up demand and needed capacity for more instruments. Our cell and gene therapy offering has demonstrated value proposition by adding new customers throughout the past two years, even when new biotech funding has been drastically reduced. Our spatial biology growth vertical now has an automated solution that is unmatched in its speed and multiomic capabilities that will also pull through larger quantities of our gold standard RNA scope and antibody reagents. And last but not least, our Molecular Diagnostics growth vertical is already in growth acceleration mode as its unique and underpenetrated portfolio of products continue to take market share. Thus, the gradual road to end market recovery over the next 18 months, together with our expectation for continued outperformance forms our baseline case for Bio-Techne\u2019s organic revenue growth in fiscal 2025. Our current momentum suggests low single-digit growth in the first half of the year with a possibility of mid-single-digit growth once the higher biotech funding returns into biotech spending. Our organic growth gradually accelerate to the high single digits in the second half of the year as Chinese stimulus funds are released and assuming large pharma budgets are normalized for the calendar year 2025. As we look to adjusted operating margin for the year ahead, we intend to fund all new investments with productivity initiatives and cover inflation with pricing actions, allowing the anticipated volume leverage to drop through to the bottom line. However, following a year of missed incentive compensation targets, there will need to be a reinstatement of incentive compensation accruals for both bonuses and sales commission. The impact of this reinstatement will create an approximately 100 basis point headwind to fiscal year 2025\u2019s full year adjusted operating margin and more severely impact the first half of the year than the back half. Thus, we expect first half adjusted operating margin for fiscal year 2025 be approximately 200 basis points to 300 basis points lower than prior year and the second half margin to be approximately 100 basis points to 200 basis points higher than the prior year. First half of the year, we\u2019ll have margin headwinds related to the incentive compensation reinstatement as well as continued negative product mix. While the second half margin should benefit from greater revenue volume leverage, planned productivity initiatives and improving product mix. Assuming the indicators that we are all seeing are correct, fiscal year 2025 should be the year of gradual recovery for our end markets, and with it allow us to exit the year poised for double-digit growth in a multiyear run towards adjusted operating margins of 35% as per our long-term objectives. That concludes my prepared comments. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to the operator to open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners. Your line is open. Puneet Souda : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I\u2019m just wondering if you can elaborate a bit on the RUO [ph] antibodies and cytokines in the quarter. How did that fare? And also, it seems that your instrumentation portfolio is still holding up while, your attached consumables are growing with that instrumentation portfolio. Maybe just help us understand the instrumentation dynamic a bit because when we look at the peers, the instrumentations have been weaker, but it just seems like there is a bit more demand. Maybe a part of that is Lunaphore. Just if you could help clarify the instrumentation as well on that end as well. Kim Kelderman : Puneet, good morning. Thanks for your question. Let me start with the instrument question that you asked. Yes, like most others, our instrumentation growth rates have been under pressure in the end markets, as we know them, specifically China and biopharma being constrained. But we\u2019re also proud to mention that the consumables directly related to these instruments have been growing double digits now seven quarters in a row. So we are very confident that the installed base is getting utilized optimally and that we are filling up capacity that we have in the installed base. And there with funding coming back in, we are pretty certain that there will be a drive to get increased capacity in the field and there will drive our instrumentation numbers. Your question on the RUO antibodies, it\u2019s been, obviously, the dynamics with the different end markets swinging a little bit in a bottoming out process and that makes it a lumpy business. Overall, we are looking carefully at all the different product lines. And we see some lumpiness quarter-over-quarter, but nothing that we are alerted about. And we feel overall that portfolio is nicely positioned. Puneet Souda : Okay. Thanks. And then, Jim, just clarifying the comments on fiscal year 2025. Does this mean a mid- to high-single digit overall for 2025 and an exit rate in the fourth quarter of 2025 of low double digits? Just wanted to make sure I was clear on that for organic growth. Jim Hippel : Well, I guess, as I said, I\u2019ve given some guidance on how I think the year will progress based on a baseline market expectation \u2013 that baseline market expectations for a very gradual improvement in our end markets. I don\u2019t think we see anything immediately that would suggest an improvement in our end markets in the very near term. But I think by the end of the year, we\u2019re hoping that we start to see some uplift with biotech, given the increased funding that we saw, we\u2019ve seen so far year-to-date that should turn to spending. And then continue to 2025, you have Chinese stimulus starting to kick in and the pharma budgets being reset. So that\u2019s kind of a gradual progression of the growth rates as we see it. And that\u2019s what I\u2019ve outlined in my prepared comments. And how fast that progression happens or how slow it happens will depend on what the full year number ends up being. Operator : Our next question comes from Jacob Johnson with Stephens. Your line is open. Jacob Johnson : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Maybe Jim, sticking on the guidance theme, I heard some headwinds on the margin side in the first half of the year due to incentive comp, et cetera. It sounds like maybe a little bit better in the back half of the year, but still we\u2019re looking at operating margins in FY 2024 that are well below where you\u2019ve been historically. I know some of that is related to acquisitions. I guess as we think about returning to growth in the back part of this year, how should we think about incremental margins as growth picks up again? And then I heard 35% plus. But at times, we\u2019ve seen a 40% target longer term. Is there any reason you couldn\u2019t get back to 40% over time with the caveat of M&A, it can always be dilutive to margins? Jim Hippel : Yes. Thanks for the question, Jacob. So just to reiterate, from a margin perspective, we do have a significant headwind with the incentive compensation accrual restatements across the entire company. It\u2019s about 100 basis points. So without that headwind, we would be talking about some incremental margin improvement this year. That being said, we do see a line of sight assuming the growth rates accelerate throughout the year, we do see line of sight to margin operating \u2013 adjusted operating margins being 100 basis points to 200 basis points higher than we ended this year, which would end us in the year somewhere in the mid-30s. My comment around 35% was actually greater than 35%. So it was really the message that we see this year as a year of recovery. That would set up very nicely to get back to our long-term growth objectives, which is north of 35% operating margin, up to 40%, of course. That\u2019s the range we\u2019ve always stated, and back on track to our long-term growth plan. So that was the main message behind that comment. Jacob Johnson : Got it. Makes sense. Thanks for that, Jim. And then, Kim, maybe Jim mentioned getting back to double-digit growth. Maybe just to revisit the 2023 Investor Day and the potential for growth well into the double digits. You talked about your four key growth franchises earlier and the traction there. And obviously, those are key to more robust levels of growth when the macro normalizes. I\u2019m just curious, a year later after that Investor Day, are there any of those kind of four platforms where you\u2019re more confident in the growth outlook? And then on the flip side, any of those pillars where maybe you have more restrained expectations? Kim Kelderman : Thank you, Jacob. It\u2019s a good question. It is quite, I must say, quite comforting that we look at these four growth verticals very carefully because those are also areas where investment dollars flow in and our activity level is very high. And then we continuously look at our programs there, but also the competitive landscape. And you take that all together, and we\u2019re still very committed to each and every one of those. We\u2019ve \u2013 yes, we feel that we have really differentiated position with wonderful symbiosis between those four growth verticals and the core reagents, where each of these growth verticals pulls through. Our core reagents is very high margins, and we have very differentiated positions in the market. So we\u2019re still very confident about it. The difference that you could \u2013 you would ask is like, so what is the difference between now and 1.5 years ago, and that\u2019s obviously that the end markets have slowed since and that the question is not so much, will we get to the numbers at that time projected. But the question is, when do you get to those numbers? And that timeframe is slightly delayed. So in five-year forecast, you always think about a couple of mediocre years, a couple of good years, a couple of bad years. Unfortunately, now we had a couple of lackluster years behind us. So hopefully, those are the system, and we\u2019re still on track. But it could well be that takes a little longer. And then you would have to think about delaying the $2 billion mark. But whether we get there is not the question, and we\u2019re really confident with our platforms. Operator : Our next question comes from Dan Arias with Stifel. Your line is open. Dan Arias : Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for the questions here. Jim, just looking at the model, can you maybe true us up on where GMP reagent revenue finished for the year? And then what you think a good starting point on growth might be for this year, new products, I believe, but still recovering customer spending. So what do you think that translates to for 2025, just given the importance there to the growth algorithm? Jim Hippel : Yes. Thanks for the question, Dan. GMP \u2013 overall GMP revenue growth for fiscal year 2024 did grow. We were \u2013 we did have growth overall for the year, even though it was choppy, which is a positive sign and a very tough year. And so we expect those growth rates to increase obviously an improving market. So that\u2019s essentially what\u2019s been baked into the forward guidance. Dan Arias : Okay. But is there any way you can kind of like give us a number to work for \u2013 work with as a jumping off point? Jim Hippel : Well, I\u2019d say this, we grew roughly mid-single digit for the year \u2013 for the full year in 2024. Dan Arias : Okay. And then maybe just as a follow-up on the outlook and the growth that the company is capable of here. One of the things that you usually talk about when it comes to forecasting is this idea that Bio-Techne has historically and consistently been 500 basis points to 1,000 basis points above peers on organic. To what extent do you think that logic applies in 2025, if we just think about the assumptions on market growth that are implied there? Jim Hippel : I mean, we\u2019re sticking with that guidance, right? And I think this quarter is yet another testament to it. By our calculations, our peer group in total shrink roughly about 4% this quarter and we grew 1%. And so kind of back to Puneet\u2019s question in terms of that getting back to double-digit growth, we are absolutely confident. When the market gets back to mid-single-digit growth, we will be at double digit. And so trying to predict when that full market recovery happens is difficult to do. But I think we\u2019re trying to conserve in a slower pace of recovery that 2025 as a calendar year will be a year of recovery and it might take that full calendar year to get there, which is why we\u2019re being a bit conservative on the fiscal basis ends in June. We\u2019ve been hearing from our peers also that bio production is looking to recover here perhaps a bit sooner, which might be the first bit of jolt that the industry needs to kind of get going into. So again, I think there\u2019s a lot of positive signs. We call them green shoots last quarter. I think they\u2019re still green shoot this quarter. They just haven\u2019t quite sprouted yet. I also point out that we have some company specific activity that will help our growth rate as well. We had obviously Lunaphore, Comet launch that's happening, give us multiomic capabilities, so that should be an upside for growth. And then we have our real instrument that Kim talked about in our ProteinSimple franchise, which has already gained a lot of interest with customers since we announced that future release. So between our company-specific activities and the market improving, we're feeling pretty good about next year, but we're just being very conservative around the pace of market recovery, as I think everyone else is in our peer side. Operator : Next question is from Dan Leonard with UBS. Your line is open. Dan Leonard : Thank you. I have a question on your RUO reagent product line. Is there anything you could do to accelerate growth there independent of market improvement? Kim Kelderman : Yes. Thanks for the question. The linkage to the growth platform is key there. Some of the RUO reagents fit nicely in pull-through. As you know, that we are now having enabled, for example, the Comet instruments to utilize our Bio-Techne antibodies that sit in the RUO reagent. And those mechanisms will start pulling through the core. Of course, the core goes to market itself, but that is the lackluster end market. Now we can also think about how do you get through that better than others, and that's by continuing to improve and solidify our marketplace as well. So the marketplace, making sure that it's easy to transact with Bio-Techne, making sure that our website is in great shape, combine that with the vertical platforms putting through those reagents, is the secret sauce there. And fortunately, in parts of the portfolio that is already working, because some of the RUO product lines are already in the black. Thanks for the question. Dan Leonard : Got it. Appreciate that. And Kim, correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems like your spatial portfolio is less subject to macro headwinds. So could you size that portfolio in aggregate at this point? And how fast do you think it grows in 2025? Kim Kelderman : Yes. So fortunately, we've seen some resilience in that portfolio. But I wouldn't say it's immune, right. So there are still larger pharma customers that would have a run rate of $1 million or more if it comes to quarterly usage of some of our reagents. And there is shuffling going on in an end market in which sometimes the programs get closed or sometimes locations get consolidated. Now overall, I don't think that will have a long-term effect on the need of special biology. I'm very confident that we'll be there. But the shuffling in the interim could result in some lumpiness. Overall, the run rate of that business is now at $120 million. And we see double-digit growth in the coming years, especially because we're nicely combining an instrument, top-notch instrument in the market that can pull through our RNA scope reagents as well as our antibodies. And right now, that instrument is running according to just short of 50,000 a quarter. And once we got all our reagents linked to it, we feel that, that pull-through could double and there we've become our highest pull-through instruments. So I'm very confident this is going to be a very positive product line for us and a positive effect on our company. Operator : Our next question comes from Tom DeBourcy with Nephron Research. Your line is open. Jack Meehan : Hi, thanks. This is Jack Meehan on for Tom. I was wondering if you could elaborate on what you're seeing as it relates to China stimulus, how that \u2013 what parts of the portfolio are exposed to that? And maybe just how it impacted the current quarter and confidence that steps up in the second half of the fiscal year? Thanks. Kim Kelderman : Yes. Thanks, Jack. As you know, the funding program is trickling through the different systems and regional governments. It's certainly on its way, is what we hear. Customers are certainly interested in receiving the benefits and also interested in spending the money already. And as you know, it's highly tailored to instrumentation only. And I think we're really well positioned to benefit from it. A couple of data points. First of all, our instrumentation is pretty unique and creates efficiencies and improve the data that you get out of it. So there's a fantastic value proposition there. Secondly, about a year ago, a similar funding concept was put in place, and we truly benefited. That's why our current Q4, the one we're reporting on right now, had relatively high comparables year-over-year because of that funding. And that worked out very well for us. This program is put in place for three years. So we feel that the moment these funds become available, we will benefit short-term. And then, I feel it will be a positive driver for the coming years ahead, which is, of course, better than just one quick jolt that then falls flat again. So I'm happy with that concept. Now in the meantime, out of our four product lines, we have the Ella, Ella product line and that one has already been growing very nicely in China. And as I mentioned at the beginning of the earnings call, we have seen the consumables on all four of our platforms continue to grow double-digits in the market as well and indicating that there is a very healthy usage of our instruments. So overall, I'm pretty confident that this will be a positive driver for the company. But like everybody else, the timing and when it trickles through is a little bit more vague, but I think the \u2013 if it's more important than the when, and I'm pretty certain that if is going to take place. Jack Meehan : Sounds good, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Larew with William Blair. Your line is open. Matt Larew : Hi, good morning. I wanted to start on Lunaphore. Obviously, for some \u2013 a few quarters now, you reported that demand is outstripping capacity. And I know you brought manufacturing in-house and are attempting to scale that up. So could you just maybe speak to where you're at from sort of fixing the manufacturing there from a backlog perspective? And how those two statements maybe filter in to what you think you can deliver from Lunaphore in fiscal 2025? Kim Kelderman : Yes. Thank you for the question. First of all, we were delighted that we saw a healthy demand above our capacity. That of course, always a good starting point, painful nonetheless. So our teams have worked really hard in cranking up the capacity. And yes, I think, that's ongoing now for a little over two quarters. And I'm very pleased to see the progress there. And yes, we've mentioned it that it was still a consideration in Q4, our last fiscal quarter that we are now reporting on. But that in Q1 fiscal year 2025, this problem should be going away. So the lines of capacity and demand are going to be crossing any week or any month right now. And from there, we should not be held back by the capacity constraints anymore and just be able to focus on increasing demand. So it's looking very promising from that point of view. You might not hear about that topic anymore. Matt Larew : Okay. That's good to hear. And then, Jim, just thinking about margins next year. Obviously, you gave the first half \u2013 second half guidance. But I think just kind of do a quick math on the top line and what it implies for margins, that spending next year action, some of the resets you described, is going to be quite a bit less year-over-year growth than in recent years. You referenced some productivity programs. So maybe I just want to get a sense for where you're targeting from an efficiency perspective and kind of what the balance is between try to pull costs out to get margins back in line relative to allocate investment for some of the future growth opportunities? Jim Hippel : Yes. I mean the reality is that we've been working on productive initiatives throughout this down cycle. So it's definitely throughout fiscal 2023, 2024 and have more projects in the fiscal year 2025 as well. And it's a delicate balance of making sure we adjust the structure inside of our business relative to our volumes, while maintaining and fueling the growth pillars, the growth verticals in our company that are allowing us to outperform, our competition and will propel us in the double-digit growth once the market gets back to the normal growth rates. And so it's a delicate balance, but I think we've been pretty successful in these initiatives that we're doing. And we have a line of sight to do that yet again this year and basically offset any new investments we're making in those growth pillars in particular to keep them moving forward to our five-year plan objectives. So it's an ongoing process for our company. Operator : Our next question comes from Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Your line is open. And Patrick Donnelly, your line is open. We\u2019ll take the next question from Catherine Schulte with Baird. Your line is open. Catherine Schulte : Hey guys, thanks for the questions. Maybe first, just on the outlook for the first half of low single digit organic growth, does that hold for the first quarter as well? And then any color on how we should think about protein sciences, specifically in the first half versus the back half. Jim Hippel : Yes, I\u2019ll take that. Thank you, Catherine. Again, it\u2019s a gradual, it\u2019s a very gradual increase that we\u2019re talking about fueled based off of market projections, right? And I said in my opening comments that somewhere between low and mid-single digit growth in the first half, which would suggest some level of progression in both our end markets and our absolute performance in the first half of our fiscal year 2025, I\u2019ll make sure that that\u2019s clear. With regards to where that improvement comes from, I think Kim mentioned this in his opening comments as well. Largely it\u2019s going to come from our protein science. That\u2019s the segment that\u2019s a part of our business has most been severely impacted by China, by the biotech funding issues, by the slowdown in big pharma. That\u2019s all hitting dead center into our Protein Sciences segment. So as those end markets recover, our Protein Sciences segment will be the recovers the fastest and the most, which will improve our mix over time throughout the year and ultimately improve our margins throughout the year, which is another basis for why we believe the second half margins will be significantly better than the first half. Catherine Schulte : Okay, got it. And then maybe for China, any thoughts on kind of how that trended throughout the quarter? It sounded like stabilization was what you guys were seeing, but any differences as you worked your way throughout the quarter and then what are you expecting for the first quarter for China? Jim Hippel : I would just say as for China, that it was basically a repeat of Q3. It really was in terms of, you look at the absolute dollars, the growth rates, our reagents continue to be double digit like they were last quarter, which is a great time for recovery. But instruments continue to be down and we\u2019re not projecting any major pickup on instruments until we get into our first quarter of 2025 \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, first quarter \u2013 first calendar 2025 when the stimulus kicks in for China. So we see China continue to be stable, but then really pick up its growth rates in the back half of our fiscal year. Operator : Our next question comes from Justin Bowers with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Justin Bowers, your line is open. Justin Bowers : Pardon to mute there. Can you talk \u2013 can you talk \u2013 good morning. Can you talk about the biopharma end market and how that performed across the different geographies? And then any notable pockets of outperformance or underperformance across the different growth pillars? Jim Hippel : Yes, I mean, biopharma taking China out of the mix, which we report biopharma, it\u2019s really excluding China. Anyway, we mentioned that it was low single digit growth and was very consistent globally, both in Europe and in the U.S. And yes, low single digit decline growth. But more importantly, the sequential performance of biopharma was consistent in Q4 as it was in Q3. So try not to get too caught up in growth rates because they can get a bit wonky, but really focused on the momentum of the business going forward and because 80% of our business is consumables that book and ship in the same day. It really is all about the momentum. And we\u2019re encouraged that the momentum overall, even within biopharma has at least stabilized. So I think we\u2019ve been saying this, there was no change in our message from the past two quarters where we felt like the December quarter was a bit of a bottom, and that we\u2019re kind of in this bottoming process until the markets start to fully recover. And as I mentioned in my opening comments, there\u2019s reasons to believe from a macro perspective that it will recover sooner than later, but it will probably be a gradual process going forward. Justin Bowers : Thanks, Jim. A quick follow up on Lunaphore. In terms of linking the reagents to the instruments there, is that like a multi quarter or a multi-year process? Can you talk about that, that process and phasing a little bit? Kim Kelderman : Yes. Thanks for the question. No, the initiation of linking the RNAscope HiPlex to the box is actually happening this quarter and is going to roll out throughout this quarter. The antibodies you could be using right now, so that\u2019s also already in place. Will we broaden that portfolio and add different tools to it? Yes, and that will be, I would just stay filling out of the toolbox over the coming quarters and years. But to start to get going and to do your experiments across most diseases, most species, fully automated multiomics, that\u2019s possible as we speak in the coming months. Operator : We\u2019ll take our final question from Sung Ji Nam with Scotiabank. Your line is open. Sung Ji Nam : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Just on the academic end market. I know it\u2019s relatively small. But is the expectation there also for the \u2013 for that segment to gradually recover throughout fiscal year 2025 given comps get easier? If you could maybe highlight some of the key puts and takes for that end market. Jim Hippel : Yes. I would just say from an academic perspective, it\u2019s even throughout the pandemic, both during the pandemic and post-pandemic. I think as we track our peer\u2019s performance, we\u2019re not that different in that. It has been an overly dynamic environment for academic. It\u2019s been pretty much a low single-digit to mid-single-digit kind of growth in our space. And there\u2019s \u2013 we had some lumpiness in our comps this quarter. But that\u2019s kind of what we\u2019re predicting going forward, call it, low single-digit market growth in academia. And that\u2019s what \u2013 that\u2019s basically what we\u2019ve experienced for the past several years, and we see that kind of \u2013 that not changing much going forward. And I\u2019m sure you follow as much as I do. There\u2019s different bills in Congress right now that would suggest that it will reconcile somewhere in that range and the way going forward from an NIH perspective. Kim Kelderman : I think what is a positive driver for our company is that much of the NIH funding, but also the Horizon funding in Europe has been focused on infectious diseases and technologies and sciences related to infectious diseases initiated through because of the pandemic. But there is a more normalization if it comes to doing your studies and your sciences around neurology as well as immuno-oncology, and those are areas we are stronger and better positioned in. So overall, we feel that the mix coming out of those funds will be in our advantage. Sung Ji Nam : Got you. And then just on molecular diagnostics, also a small business for you guys, relatively speaking. But you saw a very strong growth throughout 2024. And just kind of curious if this is more of a function \u2013 more of a function of you taking share? Or is it just the underlying market growing faster than expected? And then kind of could this kind of level of growth momentum could that continue into 2025 as well? Thank you. Kim Kelderman : I think it\u2019s a mixture, and thanks for the question. There are certainly just fundamental improvements where we feel that we are taking share. There\u2019s also, of course, some dynamics that we should not count on going forward all the time, because we don\u2019t know exactly. Remember that we had a couple of quarters of inventory adjustments. And then, we knew that with the destocking that we were going through a couple of quarters that were lackluster. And then we call the end of that in December and that we would be free and clear of that in the new calendar year. And that became true. But I do believe that some of the inventories also got normalized and that there is a little extra momentum there that won\u2019t repeat. Overall, though, I think there is some real underlying strength in that these end markets are healthy, and we are taking market share. Operator : It appears we have no further questions. I\u2019ll turn the program back to the speakers for any additional or closing remarks. Kim Kelderman : Yes, I will go ahead with closing statements. Thank you very much for joining the call today and for all the insightful questions. I\u2019m extremely proud of the Bio-Techne team\u2019s accomplishments and all the results that we have been able to deliver in the quarter and in the fiscal year even under the current market conditions. Our differentiated portfolio address some of the highest growth markets in life sciences and is positioned to deliver best-in-class performance for all of our stakeholders going forward. So thank you very much and to the next earnings call. Operator : This does conclude today\u2019s program. Thank you for your participation, and you may disconnect your lines at any time.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Bio-Techne Earnings Conference Call for the First Quarter of Fiscal Year 2025. At this time, all participants have been placed in listen-only mode and the call will be open for questions following management's prepared remarks. During our Q&A session, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. I would now like to turn the call over to David Clair, Bio-Techne's Vice President, Investor Relations. David Clair : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me this morning are Kim Kelderman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Hippel, Chief Financial Officer of Bio-Techne. Before we begin, let me briefly cover our safe harbor statement. Some of the comments made during this conference call may be considered forward-looking statements, including beliefs and expectations about the company's future results. The company's 10-K for fiscal year 2024 identifies certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements made during this call. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements because of any new information or future events or developments. The 10-K, as well as the company's other SEC filings, are available on the company's website within its Investor Relations section. During the call, non-GAAP financial measures may be used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. Tables reconciling these measures to most comparable GAAP measures are available in the company's press release issued earlier this morning on the Investor Relations section of our Bio-Techne Corporation website at www.bio-techne.com. Separately, in the coming weeks, we will be participating in the UBS, Stifel, Stephens and Jefferies conferences. We look forward to connecting with many of you at these upcoming events. I will now turn the call over to Kim. Kim Kelderman : Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter conference call. I'm pleased to report that the start to our fiscal year 2025 was largely consistent with our initial expectation. Continued stabilization of our biopharma end-markets combined with excellent execution by the Bio-Techne team led to 4% year-over-year organic revenue growth. Our growth pillars, including our molecular Diagnostics or Spatial Biology platforms, as well as our proteomic analysis franchise continued to outperform in constrained end-markets. It's also encouraging to see early indications of improvements in our biotech end-markets, which is validated by the strength we experienced in our cell and gene therapy business during this last quarter. I'll give additional details about the momentum in our growth pillars later in the call, but first, I want to applaud the Bio-Techne team for delivering this top-line performance with a continued focus on profitability. Jim will discuss this in more detail, but the cost containment and productivity initiatives we have put in place in recent quarters position the company to maintain its peer-leading operating margin profile. These efficiencies will also allow for continued strategic investments while expanding margins as the life science markets return to their historical growth rates. Before we get to the specifics of the quarter, I'd like to highlight the significant progress team made advancing our environmental, social and governance or ESG initiatives. During the quarter, Bio-Techne issued the fourth iteration of its Corporate Sustainability Report or CSR. In this latest CSR, we highlight the significant progress we made on this front, including the recent submission of a letter of commitment to reduce the Scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions. These adoption targets will be evaluated by the Science Based Targets Initiative in 2026. I'm proud of the team's commitment and continued progress, which positions Bio-Techne for a sustainable future. Now, let's discuss our Q1 results, starting with an overview of our performance by end-market and by geography. Overall, biopharma increased mid-single digits with strength in our cell and gene therapy workflow solutions. We also saw continued sequential stabilization from large pharma customers and improving ordering trends from our biotech customers. Academia increased low-single digits in the quarter with tough year-over-year comparables in both the U.S. and in Europe. Now for our regions. In the Americas, we grew low-single digits, excluding the diagnostics end-market. This was driven by strong growth in our cell and gene therapy vertical. Europe increased mid-single digits overall, which was bolstered by strong performance in academia. This overall performance in Europe is even more impressive considering the mid-teens growth comparable from the prior year quarter. In China, a challenging funding environment remains a hurdle to growth. However, we did see pockets of strength, including in our cell and gene therapy solutions as well as in our spatial biology franchise. Our instrument business continues to see stimulus related tender activity, which we expect to translate into orders in the third quarter of our fiscal year. Overall, China declined low-double digits during the first quarter, but we anticipate that the Chinese government will continue to prioritize to improve healthcare through investments in scientific research. Our portfolio of proteomic and spatial biology tools play an important role in these efforts. Now, let's discuss the growth pillars within our Protein Sciences segment, starting with our cell and gene therapy business. Here, we see that the value proposition of our broad portfolio of GMP reagents continues to resonate with the customers that are developing this life-changing therapy. Additionally, our cell therapy customers continue to transition from using RUO proteins for preclinical work to GMP certified reagents as they begin their clinical trials. This dynamic is providing an increasing tailwind for our business. For the quarter, our GMP reagent product lines increased over 60%, including robust growth from both our large customers as well as in the smaller biotech. As a reminder, order timing among our larger customers can create quarter-to-quarter lumpiness. So on a trailing 12-month basis, our GMP reagents business grew in the upper-teens. We are particularly pleased with this performance considering the market constraints over the same period. Next, I'd like to give an update on our ScaleReady joint venture partner, Wilson Wolf. As many of you are aware, Wilson Wolf is a developer of the market-leading G-Rex bioreactor. G-Rex is used as an efficient and cost-effective bioreactor for scaling cell therapies and is currently used in around 45% of the clinical trials taking place in Europe and in the U.S. We currently own 20% of Wilson Wolf and will purchase the remainder of the business by the end of calendar 2027 or potentially earlier depending on the achievement of various milestones. In front of the imminent Wilson Wolf acquisition, the Bio-Techne team continues to drive synergies between the two businesses. For example, we recently announced the launch of our ProPak GMP Cytokines, which are optimized for use of the Wilson Wolf G-Rex bioreactor. The use of ProPaks provides the precise quantity of GMP proteins needed to enable the highly simplified yet closed system for the expansion of cell therapies. Additionally, ScaleReady launched a G-Rex Grant Program, an initiative that is actively seeding academic and biopharma customers with G-Rex bioreactors and Bio-Techne's GMP reagents. These customers get to experience the power of the combined product offering during the preclinical development process, which nicely positions both Wilson Wolf and Bio-Techne to win in this nascent high-growth industry. Secondly, let's discuss the performance of our other growth pillar within Protein Sciences, the Proteomic Analytical Instrumentation division marketed under the ProteinSimple brand. Here, the team delivered mid-single digit growth as the challenging capital equipment environment was once again more than offset by strong consumables and service revenue growth. Looking specifically at the performance of our proteomic analytical instruments, it's worth noting that after several quarters of decline, our portfolio returned to low single digit growth in the America. Continuing with ProteinSimple, I'd like to give an update on the latest initiative to our Simple Western franchise called Leo. This next-generation instrument is a high-throughput, automated Western Blot system, enabling the simultaneous analysis of up to 100 samples in a single three-hour run. We have experienced significant customer interest in Leo following the public announcement at the end of July and the team is building a promising funnel for the upcoming launch in the second half of our fiscal year 2025. Simple Western remains the only fully-automated Western Blot system on the market. With a penetration rate of less than 20%, we see a long runway for future growth in this portfolio. Before we wrap up our discussion on Protein Sciences, I'd like to give you an update on how Bio-Techne is leveraging artificial intelligence tools to further our already-strong proteomics position. As a reminder, Bio-Techne was the first company to broadly commercialize research use-only proteins in 1985. We are pairing the data generated over the last 39 years by our internal R&D team with generative AI tools to create new designer proteins. These pivotable proteins are engineered to exhibit hyperactive properties, enhanced heat stability and other novel features. These attributes are relevant for many applications, including, of course, cell therapies. We recently launched our first two designer proteins and these will be followed by many AI engineered cytokines, growth factors and antibodies, which is nicely aligned with our roadmap. Overall, the team delivered 1% organic growth in the Protein Sciences segment. While this performance is in no way indicative of the latent growth potential in this segment, it is a distinct improvement over the low single digit declines we've experienced over the last three quarters. Remember that our Protein Sciences segment is where we have the most exposure to both China and biopharma end-market headwinds, and this segment is positioned to see the most improvement as these markets continue to normalize. Now, we will move on to the growth pillars in our recently renamed Diagnostics and Spatial Biology segment. This segment has been previously referred to as the Diagnostics and Genomics segment. However, given the segment's increasing leadership in the emerging spatial biology field, we felt that the new segment name is more indicative of our focus. Within spatial biology, demand remains strong for our fully-automated, high-throughput, hyperplex spatial biology platform called COMET. I'm pleased to report that following a successful cross-company initiative, we have increased COMET's manufacturing capacity to meet the growing demand for the insulin. We've also launched the RNAscope assays on COMET this last quarter, which enables the platform's multiomic capabilities. This means that it can now detect and visualize up to 24 proteins and 12 RNA targets simultaneously. These enhanced capabilities are in the hands of the top key opinion leaders in spatial biology, who are currently generating multiomic data to support a broader rollout, which will take place in this current quarter. Additionally, we continue to launch Bio-Techne's R&D system branded antibodies validated for use on the COMET. The RNAscope capabilities paired with a growing portfolio of validated antibodies will support a consumable stream that is expected to be the highest pull-through of any instrument under the Bio-Techne umbrella. Our other growth pillar within diagnostics and spatial is a molecular diagnostics business, which continues to perform at a very-high level with nearly 40% growth in both our ExoDx prostate test and our Asuragen kit business. We are in the initial stages of realizing the tremendous synergies that exist between the ExoDx and the Asuragen businesses illustrated by the upcoming launch of the kitted exosome-based test for breast cancer-related ESR1 mutation, which we will commercialize through our Asuragen laboratory channel. In summary, the team delivered another quarter of differentiated performance in what has proven to be a prolonged period of challenges facing the industry. Despite these challenges, fiscal year 2025 is off to a start that is aligned with our initial expectation. Our unique portfolio of innovative tools and bioactive reagents is positioned to continue to generate differentiated growth going forward. We remain focused on delivering the solutions our customers rely on to catalyze advances in science and in medicine. We have the team and the portfolio to accomplish this, while creating value for all our stakeholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim. Jim? Jim Hippel : Thank you. Thanks, Kim. I'll start with some additional detail on our Q1 financial performance and then give some thoughts on the financial outlook. Starting with the overall first quarter financial performance, adjusted EPS was $0.42 compared to $0.41 in the prior year quarter, with foreign exchange having a favorable $0.01 impact. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.21 compared to $0.31 in the prior year. Q1 revenue was $289.5 million, an increase of 5% year-over-year on a reported basis and a 4% increase on an organic basis with foreign currency exchange impacting sales by approximately 1%. Looking at our organic growth by region and end-market in Q1, North America increased low-single digits. Europe increased mid-single digits year-over-year, while China decreased low-double digits. The challenging funding environment remains a headwind for our China business with our instrument business facing the biggest challenges in a geography. We are seeing stimulus related instrument activity in China, which should start to benefit revenue growth in the region during the third quarter of this fiscal year. APAC outside of China increased low-single digits overall with Japan and South Korea both benefiting from growth in our instrument and spatial biology portfolios, which was partially offset by macro challenges in other Asian countries. By end-market in Q1, excluding China, biopharma increased mid-single digits and academia increased low-single digits in the quarter. As Kim previously mentioned, we continue to see sequential global stability in our biopharma end-market, which was bolstered by strength in our cell and gene therapy business in the quarter. Below revenue on the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin was 69.5% in the quarter compared to 71.3% in the same quarter of the prior year, driven by the impact of unfavorable product mix, partially offset by productivity initiatives and exclusion of the lower margin held-for-sale FBS business. Adjusted SG&A in Q1 was 32.3% of revenue compared to 31.3% in the prior year, while R&D expense in Q1 was 8.3% of revenue compared to 8.7% in the prior year. The increase in SG&A was driven primarily by the reinstatement of bonus and commission accruals, partially offset by diligent expense control. Adjusted operating margin for Q1 was 29%, a decrease of 240 basis points from the prior year period due to the impact of unfavorable product mix as well as the reinstatement of the previously mentioned incentive compensation accruals. We continue to execute cost containment initiatives and prioritize our growth initiatives to drive efficiencies throughout the organization with the goal of optimizing operating leverage during the ensuing market recovery. Looking at our numbers below operating income, net interest expense in Q1 was $1.1 million, decreasing $2.8 million compared to the prior year period due to lower debt levels compared to last year. Our bank debt on the balance sheet as of the end of Q1 stood at $300 million, a decrease of $19 million compared to last quarter. Other adjusted net operating income was $3.9 million in the quarter, an increase of $2.3 million compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting our 20% share of Wilson Wolf's adjusted net income and the foreign exchange impact related to our cash pooling arrangements. Moving further down the P&L. Our adjusted effective tax rate in Q1 was 21.5%, down 50 basis points compared to the prior year due to geographic mix. Turning to cash flow and return of capital. $63.9 million of cash was generated from operations in the quarter and our net investment and capital expenditures was $9.2 million. Also during Q1, we returned capital to shareholders by way of $12.7 million in dividends. We finished the quarter with $161.1 million average diluted shares outstanding. Our balance sheet finished Q1 in a strong position with $187.5 million in cash and our total leverage ratio remains well below one times EBITDA. Going forward, M&A remains a top priority for capital allocation. Now, I'll discuss the performance of our reporting segments, starting with the Protein Sciences segment. Q1 reported sales were $204.5 million with reported revenue flat compared to the prior year period. The exclusion of the Fetal Bovine serum business, which is currently classified as held-for-sale business, unfavorably impacted reported segment revenue growth by 1%. Thus, organic revenue for the segment increased 1%. Operating margin for Protein Science segment was 39.4%, a decrease of 380 basis points compared to the prior year quarter as unfavorable volume and product mix as well as the reinstatement of incentive compensation accruals were partially offset by cost management and structural alignment initiatives. Turning to Diagnostics and Spatial Biology segments. Q1 sales were $83.2 million with both reported and organic growth increasing 14% compared to the same quarter last year. Our molecular diagnostics business once again led segment growth. Moving on to the Diagnostics and Spatial Biology segment, operating margin at 5.1%. The segment's operating margin increased compared to the prior year's 0.7% due primarily to the impact of volume leverage and productivity initiatives, partially offset by the reinstatement of incentive compensation accruals. We anticipate steady improvement in diagnostics and spatial biology operating margin as Lunaphore scales throughout the fiscal year. In summary, our Q1 performance was largely in-line with the expectations we provided last quarter, which keeps our initial assumptions and expectations for the remainder of fiscal year '25 intact. As expected, we started the fiscal year with broad strength across our Diagnostics and Spatial Biology segment. Lunaphore continues to gain acceptance as the instrument of choice in spatial translational research and our molecular diagnostics business continues to capitalize on the opportunity in front of it with its informative ExoDx prostate cancer test and Asuragen's pipeline of innovative product launches. Within our Protein Sciences segment, we saw continued stability in our biopharma end-markets with initial signs of improvement in the smaller biotech end-market. This improvement combined with the strength we saw in cell and gene therapy, we believe it's indicative of the healthy biotech funding levels we saw throughout 2024, starting to materialize into biotech spending. Thus, given how our first quarter playout, our current momentum would suggest mid-single digit growth in the first half of the year or said another way, we expect our Q2 top line performance to look similar to Q1. We continue to see the potential for organic growth to gradually accelerate in the second half of our fiscal year through a fourth quarter exit rate of high single digits as Chinese stimulus funds are released, followed by a gradual recovery in large pharma earlier stage R&D spending. Admittedly, large pharma remains the most significant wildcard in this outlook, but we believe calendar 2025 has the potential to be a year of more normal levels of pharma R&D spend as greater clarity on the IRA impact as well as recent project rationalization and restructuring initiatives clear the path for new investments by these customers. Our adjusted operating margin outlook also remains intact with the first half of fiscal 2025 expected to be 200 to 300 basis points lower than prior year and the second half margin expected to be approximately 100 to 200 basis points higher than prior year. The first half of the year will have margin headwinds related to the incentive compensation accrual reinstatement as well as negative product mix, while the second half margin should benefit from greater revenue volume leverage, planned productivity initiatives and improving product mix. That concludes my prepared comments. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners. Please proceed with your question. Puneet Souda : Yes, hi guys, thanks for taking the question. And congrats on the quarter here. The first one is, you know, it's great to see the beat in diagnostics and spatial, but could you elaborate how sustainable is that momentum and speak to both the spatial versus the diagnostic side of the business. And what you're seeing on the biotech and biopharma improvement? I have to say is, you know, it is rare in the current market backdrop to see that. So just can you elaborate a bit on your confidence to continue to see that growth and why is this not something unique to this quarter? And what gives you confidence that that should continue into the December ending quarter and into the first half of 2025? Kim Kelderman : Yes, Puneet, thank you for your question. And I'll take the first part of it and then pitch the second part to Jim. You know, to your question, diagnostics and spatial biology, is it sustainable? I do believe so. We, if I pick it apart, we have the ExosomeDx prostate test, right. And it has had great momentum over the, over the last six quarters or so. We still have plenty of runway and market penetration ahead of us, and we're seeing real strong adoption. So we believe that we still have quite a ways to go there. In the meantime, we also know that we have similar momentum in the Asuragen kits that we're selling to diagnostics laboratories. That momentum we are also confident will continue. We have a strong R&D funnel. We have already talked about a upcoming launch for ESR1 breast cancer treatment resistance test, right, which is an exosome-based test that we will launch through our Asuragen laboratory channel. And in addition, we will launch other genetic tests during this fiscal year in that portfolio. So good momentum in the market as well as good momentum in the R&D funnel. If I then jump to the spatial biology business, I mean, a Comet launch is still in its early days and sees very nice adoption from an instrument point of view in the markets. And then we know internally that we will see bolstered growth from the consumables we are enabling on this instrument, right. We have RNAscope in the early days that is now compatible so that you can do true multiomics experiments on the Comet launch. And of course, we are continuing to launch our R&D systems' branded antibodies of which we've launched 25 or so in this last quarter that also will run on this multiomics instrument. So we believe we have momentum in all three arms of this segment and that it will continue like that. For the second half of the question, I'll give Jim the microphone. Jim Hippel : Yes. Hi Puneet, Thanks. You know, as we talked about, as we talked about last quarter and continue this quarter, for us to have mid-single digit growth by, you know, in Q2, we need to see the biotech funding strength that we've seen throughout the year start to materialize into biotech spend. And in Q3 -- our first quarter here, calendar Q3, we had, you know, very strong cell and gene therapy growth which was benefited both by the smaller biotechs as well as larger pharma. And what we saw in the broader and within cell and gene therapy, it was again broad-based growth. Now, we know we have some very large customers that can be lumpy and yes, those did well this quarter. But even the smaller customer mix within cell and gene therapy also was strong. Now, it was very, very strong. We don't necessarily expect that same level of strength in Q2 that we saw in Q1. But what was encouraging was that in the back half of our first quarter, as you know, Puneet, we monitor our daily run rates, our run rate business; those sales that are under 1,000 bucks a pop. That make up a very large portion of our RUO business. We monitor that on a daily basis to look for underlying momentum and trends. And in the back half of the quarter, we started to see the smaller biotechs growth rates not just stabilize, but actually start to pick up a bit. Now, it's not off the races, but it's nice to see some positive growth in those run rates within small biotech, more broadly across our entire RUO portfolio. And we saw that momentum continue into October. So that's what gives us some confidence that that funding is starting to turn into spending on a more broad basis. Broad basis, the cell and gene therapy will maintain, we think, a very strong growth in Q2 as it did in Q1, just probably not as strong. So that will come down a bit perhaps in growth rates, but we think be offset by the rising tide we're seeing in our RUO momentum in smaller biotech. Puneet Souda : Got it. That's super helpful, Jim. So just following up on the cell and gene therapy comments you made. Can you elaborate a bit on -- you know, are these new trial starts or existing trials that are scaling up or moving into later phases? And I think you had provided some account metrics before. Just wondering where the overall account metrics are for the GMP proteins and the cell and gene therapy business. Thank you. Kim Kelderman : Yes, Puneet. Cell and gene therapy growth vertical, as you know, we are really pleased with the progress there. We mentioned in the past that we have about 400 customers in this funnel and of which 58 customers are now in the early phases of various stages of the clinical trials. And we see customers progressing through the funnel which then drives order sizes. But fortunately, we also see the volume and the order sizes for the smaller customers increase just as well. So we feel there's broad momentum in this, in this business. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jacob Johnson with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Jacob Johnson : Good morning. Congrats on the quarter. Maybe sticking with the cell and gene therapy theme, I think kind of below the line. You had positive other income during the quarter. I believe that's where Wilson Wolf flows through. Can you just talk about how Wilson Wolf trended in the quarter and any benefit on the other income line from them and maybe how to think about that the next few quarters? Kim Kelderman : Jake, thanks for the question. So Wilson Wolf is also seeing great momentum and that's probably where you see the numbers coming from. As you know, we own 20% of Wilson Wolf at the moment, and they had a great quarter with over 30% growth just as well. For further financial detail, I'll allow Jim to pitch in. Jim Hippel : Yes, I won't get into specifics as the contribution part of that to Wilson Wolf, but it did grow nicely year-over-year. But I'd say a big chunk of that favorability in other non-operating income below the line came from the FX translation from our cash pooling arrangements. Jacob Johnson : Got it. Thanks for that Jim. And Jim, maybe sticking with you just on the cost side of things, I guess specifically around OpEx, some moving pieces on the SG&A line. I think you guys are talking about efficiency. I think there's maybe a restructuring charge in there and then obviously the return of incentive comp. Can you just -- You reiterated your commentary around the margin outlook for this year, but as we think about SG&A and kind of the pacing the rest of the year, can you just help us think through kind of any one-time items in one queue and then any benefits from cost savings as we get into the rest of the year? Jim Hippel : Sure. As you think about the margin profile specifically for the upcoming quarter here, Q2, a couple of things to keep in mind is that our incentive comp headwinds are actually stronger in Q2 than they were in Q1, meaning we had even more clarity as to where our performance was going to be in Q2 than we did Q1 last year. So we reversed accruals even further. So there is a larger year-over-year headwind when it comes to that part of the equation. When you think about the sequential margin profile from Q1 to Q2, there's also a slight headwind from the fact that our merit increases that go annually to all employees are the last month of the quarter. So we basically have two months of a headwind in Q2 relative to Q1 as a result of that. So that's why we're kind of still holding that same overall guidance for the half in terms of margin. When you think about Q3 and Q4, really it's holding the line as we did last quarter. On our view there, it is dependent on the pace of recovery on the topline. But we have a lot of productivity initiatives and rationalization that's happening and prioritization to protect the bottom line. And as long as that growth modestly comes through as we predicted, we think we can get back to a positive margin expansion in the back half. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with UBS. Please proceed with your questions. Dan Leonard : Thank you. First one on Comet. I'd love to better understand the unit model there. Could you remind me what is the ASP for the instrument and what would you expect pull through per year to look like in consumables and then also by how much did you increase Comet manufacturing capacity? Kim Kelderman : Yes, Dan, thanks. Thanks for your interest in spatial biology that we're also so enthusiastic about. Yes, the Comet ASP is around 350 and $350,000, that is. And of course, there's variations of types you can order or, you know, certain capabilities. So there's a little bit of variation in there, but typically around 350. And we've not been able or we've not had to discount this yet at all. So we see that that price point to be the right one at the moment. Momentum has been great. We have increased our manufacturing capacity to be able to keep up with demand. However, we do not usually talk about unit numbers as to how many are in our installed base or how many we shipped. So that part I will refrain from. Dan Leonard : Okay. And just to circle back on your comments on China, can you remind me how much of your revenue mix in China is instruments versus consumables and any more color you could offer on the magnitude of the tender activity that you were discussing? Kim Kelderman : Yes. So as you know, China is around 9% of our overall global revenues for Bio-Techne and it has been declining, as is well known. We do believe that the mix has shifted temporarily a little bit more towards the consumable side. But typically, the mix in revenue there is 50-50. So 50% in instruments and 50% in consumables. The activity around the tender, we are, as you know, we are in our models, we're looking at some slight benefits from tender activity in our third quarter, which is the first calendar quarter. And we do see this activity if it comes to, you know, acquisitions and in-bound questions around instrumentation. Most of that sits in the Western Blot business, the automated Western Blot. And that makes sense, because the funding is aligned with refreshing larger capital and is also focused on a more academic setting. So that's where we see, that's where we would expect a slight tailwind and that could spark definitely a turnaround in the country which we all have been waiting for. Jim Hippel : And I just add from a magnitude perspective, you know, it'd be -- we think right now what's in the pipeline would be enough to go from declining growth that we're seeing today to modest positive growth in the region in our Q3. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Thomas DeBourcy with Nephron Research. Please proceed with your question. Thomas DeBourcy : Hi guys, thanks for taking the question. Just had a question related to your kind of directional guidance on Q2, and I guess kind of sequentially flat. I think on a year-over-year basis it would kind of have roughly mid-single digit growth. But you do have a little bit easier comp in Q2. So just any thoughts just otherwise between the segments in terms of what's kind of driving sort of that mid-single digit growth for the second half, for target Q2? Kim Kelderman : Yes, I mean there's some nuances within that in the sense that, you know, again because so much of our business is based off of daily run rates purchased every day that researchers are in their labs. We look at the holidays, for example, and where the holidays fall, particularly around Christmas and New Year's and they're both in the middle of the week this year as opposed to the beginning or the end. And I know it sounds like a nuance, but it is important with regards to when people take their vacations and so forth. So that's a bit of a headwind relative to last year when you talk about an easier comp, for example. So other than that, I would say it's really just -- it's really pharma has been, I would call it, stable for us the past couple quarters and we see that continuing into Q2 without any significant uptick as of yet. You know, we're hopeful for that as we get into 2025 and new budgets are released. Academic, you know, pretty much chugging along the way. It has been in the low single digits and it's really about the smaller biotech, and we think there's a bit of a -- although the overall biotech market for us at least appears to be slowly gaining some momentum, we did have an exceptional quarter in Q1 with regards to specifically cell and gene therapy in our bigger customers, in particular, all did some large purchases. And we think that will settle down a bit in our Q4, I'm sorry, in our Q2, calendar Q4, but these offset by the gaining momentum we're seeing in our RUO biotech. Thomas DeBourcy : And just, I guess one quick follow-up, you know, sort of related to that is just in terms of your, you know, kind of overall thoughts on year end, calendar year end, budget flush. You know, I think last year there was very little budget flush by either academic or biopharma. You know, maybe it's not back to normal, but would you expect that to be incrementally better versus last year? Kim Kelderman : And again, budget flush doesn't impact us as greatly as it does perhaps other companies with a much higher instrument percentage as well as more expensive instruments. But that being said, it does impact our ProteinSimple franchise in particular a little bit. And honestly, it's anyone's guess right now. There's a thesis out there that pharma in particular has been holding back on their CapEx budgets all year and haven't even spent their budgets. And there might be some budget flush as a result of that. If in fact, they're seeing a more return to normalcy ahead of them in 2025. But we're not necessarily hearing that from the field yet. So, you know, as of right now, I would say that it looks less likely than more likely based on what we're hearing out in the field. But it can flip pretty quickly. So we really won't know until we get into December, but if it happens, it could be some upside. Thomas DeBourcy : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Bowers with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Justin Bowers : Hi, good morning everyone. And just sticking with the previous line of questions with Jim, with sort of the similar organic growth outlook in 2Q, is there any divergence within the segments, i.e., are you still looking for sort of like low-single digit in Protein Sciences and then call it mid-teens and DSB? And then within biopharma, it sounds like you're saying that large pharma has been fairly stable in terms of spend over the last couple of quarters. Are we hearing that correctly? And then the follow-up to that would be, within the different businesses within Protein, within the Proteins franchise, i.e., ProteinSimple, the run rate business in ELISA are the trends fairly stable there or is there some movement there? Kim Kelderman : I'll try to hit in a little bit. As you know, we generally don't give any kind of guidance by segment. But what I would say in general is, if you think about the end markets and how I just described the end markets, what it would suggest is that we see a very gradual improvement within our Protein Sciences segment as the biotech funding hopefully continues to gain momentum. And with regards to the Diagnostics and Spatial Biology, there is a component of business in there that's very OEM driven that can be more lumpy. So although we expect double-digit growth to continue in our diagnostics in general, it may not be as strong as what we saw this quarter, which is how you kind of get to the same overall growth rate in Q2 as Q1. As it pertains to the questions around the assays, I would say the assays are generally performing very similar to our reagents in terms of the, most of it's RUO based. I'm trying to remember what the middle question was - large pharma? Justin Bowers : More around large pharma, is that stable? Or is it? Kim Kelderman : Yes. Sorry, sorry. Yes, I know the question now. So yes, I mean it's been stable for us. As we talked about before, we saw our larger pharma customers kind of drop off on their run rates early in the calendar year 2024, we think when their budgets were initially released. And we've seen that pretty much be somewhat down year-over-year. Overall, we've seen it be stable sequentially quarter to quarter in terms of what we'd expect to see from a seasonality perspective. So not seeing any major change in pharma one way or the other as of right now, but we didn't expect to either. As our guidance suggested, we feel like assuming pharma does come back in 2025, we probably won't see much of it until our April-May timeframe, which is our last quarter of the fiscal year. Justin Bowers : Understood. Just one quick follow-up. What was the comp for biopharma in fiscal 1 '24? Kim Kelderman : I know we talked about it. Hold on one second. I can find it quickly. Let's go on the next question, and I'll try to interject at some point. Justin Bowers : Sure. Thank you. Kim Kelderman : Yep. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Catherine Schulte with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Tom Peterson : Hi everyone, this is Tom Peterson on for Catherine. Thanks for taking our questions. Congrats on the solid quarter. Wanted to maybe return to the spatial biology portfolio. You know, hear you on the updated manufacturing capacity for Comet, I guess what was ACD growth in the quarter specifically? And you know, with respect to your comments around the pull through on that ultimately being, you know, potentially that the highest frame any instrument in the portfolio. I guess, what's your level of visibility into how close do you think you can get to that level in fiscal 2025? Jim Hippel : Yes, thanks Tom for this question. So the -- yes, overall momentum in the spatial biology, we're very pleased to see. Comet has indeed met our expectations if it comes to the launch. The first couple of quarters, as you know, we had to indeed do a little bit of a sprint in the building out the capacity. We feel comfortable we can now deliver on that. The reagents, it's earlier day, right. So as you heard in the script, we have R&A scope now running on the comet, but it is in the hands of key opinion leaders generating the data necessary for a broader rollout, which will happen in this current quarter. The ACD franchise overall saw a little bit of a headwind from we call it PAS, Pharma Assay Services, and that put some pressure on the overall numbers of that division. We don't talk on that level though, if it comes to growth and absolute revenue numbers, but there were some pressure in there, especially related to pharma projects. So some pharma projects got pushed out, which is in line with the overall health of that market that we've been talking about. So nothing new there, but definitely still a slight impact from projects pushed out. Overall though, we do see that the future of this spatial biology will be bright. We know the system is seeing real traction. Customers are really happy with it. We will have R&A scope available on there and then we'll start pulling through our antibodies from the R&D systems brand. Tom Peterson : Got it. That's super helpful. And maybe just a quick follow-up on China stimulus. I guess, you know, hear some of the comments around the funnel activity, any changes in underlying activity levels here in the quarter. And then we've heard from some other peers in the space that this seamless program isn't covering the entirety of the instrument purchases. So I guess at a high level, you know, how big of an impact do you think that this dynamic is and do we need to see broader China macro improvement alongside these stimulus distributions to kind of drive a return to typical market growth in China in 2025? Thanks. Kim Kelderman : Yes, thanks, Tom. I'll take the first part of it. You know, as we mentioned earlier, you know, we see, we're pretty much seeing what we expected, which is, you know, the different quoting activity and interest in our product lines. As I mentioned in the earlier question, very much related to Western Blot, automated Western Blot instrumentation, which makes sense. And Jim also mentioned earlier, and I will give him the microphone about the impact it will have on our growth rate. Jim? Jim Hippel : Yes, as I mentioned earlier, it will be enough of a stimulus to flip China for us from being negative growth to modestly positive growth. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Larew with William Blair. Please proceed with your question. Matt Larew : Hi, good morning. I wanted to ask on actually the - well I guess cell and gene therapy one, which is just broadly within biotech and biopharma. The extent you have visibility to this is sort of the pickup in work that you maybe assess was paused or on hold or delayed and now is returning, or is this related to, you know, new project work that's been coming in? And maybe the second part of that would be, if there's any breakdown in your view from sort of a discovery versus clinical stage and some of the work coming back? Kim Kelderman : Thanks for the question. Yes, I think we see both, right. So I mentioned earlier that we see customers progressing through the funnel and getting into their Phase 1 clinicals, some of them even in Phase 2 clinicals. And with that, the order size is increasing as you would expect. In the meantime, we've also seen order frequency of the existing smaller accounts or smaller orders grow in a similar speed. And then we are glad to also report that we found, I'm not sure if we should be mentioning the number, but we found a good portion of our customers to be new and added to the funnel. So basically we're pretty happy with the activity level on all three of those parts of the equation. Matt Larew : Okay. And then you made another announcement about a G-Rex Grant. Obviously, you've been working each on the ScaleReady partnership, even advance of owning Wilson Wolf. That space obviously remains competitive with new entrants looming, and you are clearly investing back in the future there. So just be curious for your take on where you stand from that sort of product and strategy development as well as sort of the competitive standing of the portfolio you're offering. Kim Kelderman : Yes, thanks. First off, we are very happy with the competitive advantages we see utilizing the G-Rex incubator versus our competitors. The scalability, the cost position, the flexibility as well as the performance are just very much where we hope them to be and significantly differentiating from other solutions. In the meantime, we know that there are tremendous synergies with our core portfolio, specifically the R&D systems related GMP proteins, cytokines, media. So we have a fantastic overlap there. We also know that it is in the early days of a customer being exposed to a G-Rex and starting their project where you make your decisions related to what reagents you use in the G-Rex and if you use the G-Rex as a vehicle, to begin with. So that's the reason why we feel that these grants are important. We help these customers not only getting towards their therapy and the design of their therapy faster, which is great for humanity, but we also help them getting the right tools in place. And we also know that once these customers are happy with their solution that they will be utilizing the G-Rex as well as our biotech media agents going forward. So we feel it's a smart way to create a win-win. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sung Ji Nam with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question. Sung Ji Nam : Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Just on the academic and market side of things, great to see growth there despite the challenging comparisons. You pointed out Europe. But could you maybe elaborate further in terms of which of the product or business segments where you might have seen the strongest growth in the quarter? Kim Kelderman : Yes, we were overall very pleased with our academic performance. And we did mention Europe because it grew nicely against very significant comparables. However, that was not very different in the U.S. Meaning the U.S. comparables were very, very strong as well. And that means that we're really happy with the performance in academic across the product lines and across the regions. As you know, there's been some good news around Horizon funding in Europe and funding levels in the U.S. just as well. However, we always say that the overall funding levels are interesting for us, but not the true driver for our results. It is typically in these last couple of years being related to where the funding flows. And the last year, it's been clearly flowing more in the direction where our products are benefiting from, which are more the cancer related, neuroscience related fields which definitely drive adoption of our products. So that's the dynamic there in academic. Sung Ji Nam : Gotcha. Great. And then just on the molecular diagnostic side, you know, also great to see strong growth there. Was wondering if there might be any updates in terms of any of the partnership opportunities, especially with the Exosome Diagnostics' technology. Kim Kelderman : Yes, so we have, as you know, signed an agreement around kidney rejection with Thermo. The teams are working on that assay, and it's in Thermo's hands. As you know, we will continue to support the efforts there. And yes, we have other signatures in the making. But for now, as I have mentioned over the last couple of quarters, the team is mainly focused on creating Exosome based tests that we can market ourselves through the Asuragen channel. And in the script as well as I just mentioned earlier, the ESR1 test is the very first product of bringing the exosome-based testing into the Asuragen channel that goes and sells, commercializes into laboratories. And that's really our preferred modus operandus, and that's what we're going to focus our pipeline on for the future. Sung Ji Nam : Great. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. This concludes our Q&A session. I would like to pass the call back over to Kim for closing remarks. Kim Kelderman : Thank you. And thank you for joining the call today and for your insightful questions. I'm extremely proud of the Bio-Techne team's accomplishments and the results we have been able to deliver this quarter. Our differentiated portfolio addresses some of the highest growth markets in life sciences and is positioned to deliver best-in-class performance for all our stakeholders going forward. Thank you. And have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
