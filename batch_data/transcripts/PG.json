Today's discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections. As required by Regulation G, P&G needs to make you aware that during the call, the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Management believes these measures provide investors valuable information on the underlying growth trends of the business. Organic refers to reported results excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, where applicable. Free cash flow represents operating cash flow less capital expenditures and adjusted for after tax impact of major divestitures. Free cash flow productivity is the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings. Any measure described as core refers to the equivalent GAAP measure, adjusted for certain items. P&G has posted on its website, www.pg.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP and other financial measures. Now, I will turn the call over to P&G\u2019s Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller. Jon Moeller : Thanks, and good morning. Before we get to results, I want to start with a few housekeeping items. Consistent with our emphasis on productivity, as well as our focus on annual versus quarterly planning periods, A.G. Lafley and I have decided to apportion our efforts on P&G investor communications as follows. A.G. will lead our fiscal year end call, providing perspective on the year we\u2019ve just completed and outlining our priorities for the new fiscal year. A.G. will represent P&G at our most significant each year. This year those will be the Barclays Back to School conference and CAGNY. And he will lead the annual shareholders meeting each October. I\u2019ll head up the non year-end quarterly calls and the remaining investor conferences. We will both continue to meet on a one-on-one basis with current and potential investors. We\u2019ll continue to involve other key executives in investor meetings and conferences, as we have in the past. Our objective is to provide shareholders the information they want and need in a more productive manner that is consistent with our business planning approach. One last announcement, John Chevalier, who heads up our investor relations practice, will now report directly to me. John was previously reporting to our treasurer, Teri List, who is now at Kraft Foods. John joins me on the call this morning. Let me move now to our first quarter results. All-in sales grew 2%, including the 2-point headwind from foreign exchange. Organic sales grew 4%, putting us on track to deliver 3% to 4% organic sales growth for the fiscal year. Organic sales growth was driven by strong organic volume growth of 4%. Pricing and mix were both neutral to sales growth for the period. Organic sales were in line or ahead of a year ago in all reporting segments. Organic sales were up low single digits in developed markets and high single-digits in developing markets. P&G global value market share was around 20% for the most recent 3-month period. We held or grew global market share in businesses representing about two-thirds of global sales. Moving to the bottom line, all-in earnings per share were $1.04. This includes $0.02 of noncore restructuring costs. Core earnings per share were $1.05, down $0.01 versus the prior year. Foreign exchange was a $0.09 per share headwind. On a currency neutral basis, core earnings per share was up 8% for the quarter. Core operating profit margin declined 70 basis points as solid organic sales growth and 200 basis points of cost savings were offset by foreign exchange and gross margin mix impacts. Core gross margin was down 130 basis points. Strong cost savings of 160 basis points and volume leverage was more than offset by geographic and category mix of 140 basis points, foreign exchange of 80 basis points, higher commodity costs, and higher manufacturing startup costs versus the prior year. Core SG&A costs decreased 60 basis points, driven by overhead cost savings of 40 basis points, marketing spending efficiencies, and volume leverage. These benefits were partially offset by foreign exchange, general wage inflation, and reinvestments in innovation and go-to-market capability. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.8%. The combined impact from tax, interest expense, interest income, non-operating income, and outstanding share count was essentially neutral to core earnings per share growth. We generated $1.3 billion in free cash flow in the quarter, repurchased $2.5 billion in stock, and returned $1.7 billion of cash to shareholders as dividends. Free cash flow was reduced by a discretionary cash contribution of nearly $1 billion to our German defined benefit pension fund. This is reflected in the change in other operating assets and liabilities line on the cash flow statement. Free cash flow productivity was 43% for the quarter, including a negative 32 point impact from the pension contribution. This contribution was included in our projection of about 90% free cash flow productivity for the fiscal year. Overall, we remain on track with each of our fiscal year objectives. We\u2019re focused on four important areas to drive continued improvement in our results. Value creation for consumers and share owners is our top priority. Operating TSR is our primary business performance measure. Operating TSR is an integrated measure of value creation at the business unit level requiring sales growth, progress on growth and operating margin, and strong cash flow productivity. Operating TSR drives focus on core businesses, our leading, most profitable categories, and leading, most profitable markets. Our strongest business unit and total company positions are in the U.S. We need to continue to ensure that our home market stays strong and is growing. We\u2019ll continue to grow and expand our business in developing markets, with a focus on the categories and countries with the largest sizes of prize and the highest likelihood of winning. Developing markets will continue to be a significant growth driver for our company. We\u2019ll continue to focus the company\u2019s portfolio, allocating resources to businesses where we can create the most value. We will continue to exit businesses where we determine that potential buyers with different capability sets can create more value than ourselves. Consistent with our focus on operating TSR, we\u2019re continuing to push forward with our productivity and cost savings efforts. We made good progress over the last fiscal year and a half, we have strong plans for fiscal 2014, and are working to accelerate fiscal 2015 plans into 2014. Versus the target run rate of $1.2 billion, we\u2019re planning more than $1.4 billion of cost of goods savings this fiscal year across materials, logistics, and manufacturing expense. We expect to improve manufacturing productivity by at least 6% this year. We\u2019re up more than 8% fiscal year to date. We\u2019re continuing the work on North American and European supply chain redesign to lower cost, reduce inventory, and improve customer service. This work will require additional investment in both restructuring and capital, but should generate very attractive returns. We\u2019ll communicate more details as plans are finalized. We will deliver our 2014 enrollment reduction goals and then work to accelerate [role] reduction\u2019s plan for 2015 into 2014. There are several teams supported by external advisors and benchmarks working in parallel on plans to deliver these reductions. The teams span business sectors, market development organizations, and corporate functions. We\u2019ll be working to consolidate individual team plans into one overall company plan by the end of the calendar year and plan to discuss key elements with you at the CAGNY conference in February. We continue to drive marketing ROI improvements through an optimized mix of advertising media, greater clarity of messaging, and greater efficiency in non-advertising marketing spending. We expect absolute marketing spending to increase this year, but marketing as a percentage of sales to decline modestly versus the prior year level. We are committed to making productivity a core strength and a sustainable competitive advantage. We\u2019ll continue to strengthen our innovation efforts. We aim to be the innovation leader in every product category where our brands compete. Near term, we\u2019re shipping major innovation upgrades across the entire baby care line in North America, providing superior dryness, comfort, and fit, particularly overnight, to better deliver what moms want for their babies. The Ariel pods launch in Western Europe is tracking well above expectations. Consumption trends on Tide pods have accelerated even further in the U.S. behind new trial-building merchandising. We\u2019re continuing to see strong growth in our new oral care expansion markets, and are experiencing significant growth behind the expansion of our 3D White innovation. We\u2019re delivering strong market share gains in the U.S. deodorant category, behind the Secret Stress Sweat innovation and on Old Spice, as we launch new scent collections and commercial campaigns. We\u2019re also strengthening our share position of the U.S. battery business, behind the Quantum innovation and recent distribution increases. P&G battery value share is up nearly 1.5 points for the past three months. In family care, our recent Bounty upgrades were recognized in external product testing. Bounty had the top three products in the test, including a landslide victory for Bounty Duratowel over all other products. Recent product packaging and commercial innovations on Pantene are driving strong growth in the Latin America and Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East, and Africa region. Pantene shipments were up double digits in both regions for the quarter. Next, we\u2019re improving execution and operating discipline. We simply have to execute better, more consistently, and more reliably. It\u2019s not about exhorting the organization to do better, it is about rigorously following tried and true work processes that deliver results. It\u2019s only airing high ROI advertising. It\u2019s disciplined initiative launch qualification and planning. It\u2019s about staying ahead of changing regulatory standards to ensure we\u2019ve maintained a full supply capability. It\u2019s about everyone playing their position and playing it well. Our progress in operating discipline and execution is beginning to be recognized. In the most recent Advantage Monitor U.S. customer survey, which rates retailer satisfaction with their suppliers, P&G improved its overall ranking for the middle third of the 40 suppliers evaluated to the top third, with significant improvements in areas such as category development and shopper insights. Our goal is to be number one, and our focus is on translating this improved operating performance into better and more consistent top and bottom line results. Last, we\u2019re making strategic investments in innovation and go-to-market capabilities. The budget increase in R&D will enable us to strengthen our near and mid-term innovation pipeline. Our go-to-market investments are primarily focused on improving sales coverage in our fastest-growing markets and fastest-growing channels. We believe that the focus we\u2019re bringing to these four areas : operating TSR, productivity, innovation, and operational excellence will enable us to continue to improve results, which brings us to guidance. We\u2019re reconfirming 2014 guidance, top line, bottom line, and cash. We\u2019re maintaining our organic sales growth range of 3% to 4%. Achieving organic sales growth in the upper half of our target range would result in modest overall market share growth. Foreign exchange is expected to be a sales growth headwind of about 2 points, which leads to all-in sales growth in the range of 1% to 2% for the fiscal year. On the bottom line, we\u2019re maintaining our forecast for core earnings per share growth of 5% to 7%. This translates to constant currency core earnings per share growth in the range of 11% to 13%. On an all-in GAAP basis, we expect earnings per share to grow approximately 7% to 9%. This range reflects somewhat lower noncore restructuring costs in fiscal year 2014 versus the prior year. First half core earnings per share growth will likely be flat to slightly down versus prior year. Second half growth will be much stronger. Our second half forecast is not based on a significant deceleration in organic sales growth. Second half earnings growth increase is driven by foreign exchange and cost structure. Foreign exchange will be a significant headwind in the first half, but will moderate in the second half at recent spot rates. We estimate that about 70% of the fiscal year FX impact will be in the first half of the fiscal year. We\u2019ll also annualize operating impacts from last year\u2019s Venezuelan bolivar devaluation in the second half. There are several second half cost benefits. Manufacturing startup costs will largely annualize in the second half of fiscal 2014 and productivity savings will build throughout the year. As you prepare your sales and earnings estimates for Q2, there are a few items you should keep in mind. Recall that the second quarter base period includes a $0.07 per share one-time gain from the sale of the Western European bleach business. We expect the foreign exchange headwind for Q2 to be similar to the impact we saw in the first quarter. We\u2019re expecting a heightened level of competitive promotional spending, ahead of our product initiative\u2019s launch in early next calendar year, especially in North American fabric care and beauty. We expect to deliver another strong year of about 90% free cash flow productivity. Our plans assume capital spending in the range of 4% to 5% of sales and share repurchase in the range of $5 billion to $7 billion, continuing to deliver on our commitment of cash return to shareholders. In addition to the assumptions included in our guidance, we continue to be very transparent about some key items that are not included. Foreign exchange continues to be very volatile. Rates improved somewhat in September and October, largely reversing the large negative move we saw in late July and August. But this could quickly change. The guidance we are reconfirming today is based on mid-October spot rates. We\u2019re closely watching the unrest in Egypt, which is a large business for us, and a base of export for the balance of Africa. Venezuelan price controls, access to dollars for imported products, and devaluation present risks, as do import restrictions and price controls in Argentina. Finally, our guidance assumes no further degradation in market growth rates. We continue to operate in a volatile environment, with uncertainty in the foreign exchange, decelerating market growth rates, and a rapidly developing policy environment. Against this backdrop, we have good market share momentum, a number of strong innovations coming to market over the balance of the year, and savings from productivity improvements that will continue to build. Our first quarter results were in line with what we expected, putting us on track to deliver our goals for the fiscal year and enabling us to make progress toward our long term growth objectives. We\u2019re making targeted investments in our core business in the most promising developing markets and biggest innovation opportunities, and are aggressively driving the productivity and cost savings. Above all, we remain focused on value creation for consumers and for our share owners. That concludes our prepared remarks. As a reminder, business segment information is provided in our press release and will be available in the slides, which we\u2019ve posted on our website, www.pg.com, following the call. I\u2019d be happy now to take any questions. Operator : [Operator instructions.] Your first question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank. You may begin. Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank : Two quick ones. China, it seems like business is doing pretty well market share-wise, everywhere in the world except for China. But if you look across categories, at least in the Nielsen data we have, you know, laundry, diapers, toothpaste, it seems like shares are under quite a bit of pressure recently. So wondering kind of what\u2019s going on there and sort of what the plan is to kind of fix that. And the second thing is, and maybe I\u2019m making a huge deal about this, but this [influx] technology on the package side, could that be a game-changer going forward in terms of how you make and buy bottles and give you a pretty neat competitive cost structure advantage? Jon Moeller : First of all, China, volume market share was essentially flat in the quarter. We did lose a little bit of ground on value share, though that continued to build sequentially, has continued to build over the past 12, 6, 3 months. So we\u2019re reasonably comfortable about our position there. We\u2019ve got a very strong innovation program coming in the back half of the year and expect China to continue to be a significant source of growth for us. On [influx], this is something we actually talked about at CAGNY. It\u2019s a disruptive proprietary breakthrough in the packaging area, and when rolled out across our businesses, it should deliver about $150 million in cost savings per year and will allow us to avoid about $50 million in capital expenditures annually. It will also bring significant sustainability benefits. It could reduce resin usage by over 100 million pounds per year and eliminate energy usage by over 250 million kilowatt hours. And finally, we\u2019re hopeful that this breakthrough will allow us to reduce our time to market for package development by up to 50%. So it is something that we\u2019re excited about and should benefit from. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of John Faucher with JPMorgan. John Faucher - JPMorgan : Wanted to talk a little bit about the negative FX leverage you\u2019re seeing here in terms of from the top line to the bottom line, particularly how your manufacturing footprint is impacting that, whether that\u2019s a big transactional hit as you\u2019re importing products into countries like Brazil. And then to sort tie that in, I\u2019ll try to make this two questions, it\u2019s actually one question, can you talk a little bit about the plan for local manufacturing? You\u2019ve got a lot of startup costs there. When can that go to being a real benefit as you look at not just your manufacturing cost, but also the ability to be more flexible when you\u2019re manufacturing locally? Jon Moeller : You\u2019re absolutely right on the dynamic on foreign exchange and the divergence between the top and bottom line impact. That disparity is primarily driven by very large currency moves in countries that have a significant dollar and euro denominated cost structure for imported materials and finished product. Just for perspective, Japan and Venezuela, which both fall into that category, account for more than 40% of the FX-related profit hurt on the quarter. And you\u2019re also right that as we\u2019re able to localize more of the manufacturing, not only will we save a significant amount of money, but we\u2019ll in essence be operationally hedged more on the bottom line. Timeline, we\u2019re bringing on a number of new facilities currently, as reflected in the startup cost figures that we\u2019ve been discussing for the past couple of quarters. I would look at that to yield benefits more in our next fiscal year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley : First, just a detail question. Can you tell us how much U.S. organic sales growth was in the quarter in emerging markets? And then the real question is, I just was hoping you could characterize the pricing environment you\u2019re seeing right now, both in the U.S. and around the world. Clearly you\u2019ve made significant market share progress, but you did highlight you expected heightened competitive activity going forward. So should we expect pricing to deteriorate a bit going forward in the balance of the year? And do you view heightened competitive activity as a big threat, at this point, to your markets progress? Jon Moeller : First, on U.S. growth rate, organic sales was about 2%, and that\u2019s also consistent with the total developed markets growth rate, which was low singles. Developed markets grew about 8%. On pricing, let me say a couple of things. First, relative to history, including the last quarter, if you look at price, inclusive of promotion, it was neutral to organic sales growth on the quarter. If you look further back, price, inclusive of promotion, has been neutral to positive for 11 consecutive quarters. It\u2019s been neutral to positive for 9 consecutive years. We would much rather invest a dollar in innovation or equity, because those benefits are proprietary and sustainable. Promotion, price discounting, there\u2019s nothing proprietary about it, and it\u2019s typically not sustainable. If you look at our promotion, the percentage of sales that moved on promotion in the July-September quarter, it was down versus a year ago, not up. So that\u2019s the past. As we look forward, it\u2019s important that while we\u2019d rather spend money on innovation and equity, it\u2019s important we be competitive from a promotion standpoint. We are not going to be ones who lead promotion escalation, but we will be competitive. We do have a period coming up in the next quarter here that precedes pretty significant initiative launches for us, and it\u2019s not atypical in that environment that we see a little bit of an increase in promotion from the competitive set trying to load consumers ahead of our initiatives. So we do expect that environment to tighten over the next three months as we head into our big initiative launch. Again, that\u2019s not something that we\u2019ll be leading. We\u2019ll continue to focus on innovation and equity. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson from Citigroup. Wendy Nicholson \u2013 Citigroup: On the gross margin, I know you don\u2019t want to give too much specifics in terms of the full year outlook, but I assume some of the manufacturing startup costs are going to fall away. Hopefully, anyway. Can you comment kind of over the full course of this year whether you expect gross margin to be up or down? Jon Moeller : It certainly will sequentially improve, and should be positive certainly by the fourth quarter, early fourth quarter. We\u2019ll have to see where it nets out total year. I honestly don\u2019t think that much about that. But we do expect for gross margin progress to turn positive by the end of the year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman \u2013 Barclays: I wanted to ask a bit about beauty margins. They were up so significantly in the quarter I was curious what was driving that. The change in allocation of resources, or holding back as you sort of sort out plans for skincare? So questions on that. And then coupled with that was in your prepared remarks, Jon, when you mentioned the heightened promotional environment expected in the second quarter ahead of initiative launches, you actually mentioned not just fabric care but also I think you said beauty, and that was sort of news to me if there\u2019s something significant coming in beauty, so if you could talk about that, it would be great. Jon Moeller : A large part of the quarter to quarter variability in profitability in beauty is being driven by initiative timing, and we have, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, and as you referenced, we have a strong slate of initiatives coming to market December through March in beauty. The specifics are not items that we\u2019ve disclosed yet, and we\u2019ll do that as we get closer to the events themselves, but there is significant innovation coming. The other thing that\u2019s impacting quarterly variability, which is a great thing, is real progress on productivity within the beauty business. They\u2019re working that as hard as anybody, and are frankly doing a great job. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Ferrara from Wells Fargo. Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo : I just wanted to ask about Tide Simply. So I guess relative to Charmin and Bounty basic, it looks like the price gap there between the premium and the mid-tier segment in those respective categories is not as wide as in direct to laundry. Premium Tide versus the baseline is a very, very large gap. So the gap between Tide Simply and premium Tide is likely to be wider than what it is between Bounty and Charmin basics, and those mainline products. So I guess the question is can you use those two as a benchmark? And how do you manage that? And is the thought process even correct there? Jon Moeller : It ultimately comes down to strong consumer segmentation and benefit alignment against those segments and the benefits that they\u2019re seeking. And it\u2019s more about that than it is about relative price point. And as you can imagine, we\u2019ve been working this for some period of time, as you know, and we\u2019ve been working very hard to ensure that the offering is very attractive to the consumer segment that we\u2019re targeting and is less attractive to the current Tide consumer, which we believe we have achieved. And that is more the mark of success on things like Bounty Basic, Charmin Basic, Luvs versus Pampers, that consumer segment and benefit alignment with their needs that drives success. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj from Bernstein. Ali Dibadj - Bernstein: Two things. I first wanted to follow up on the language in the press release and your prepared remarks about the $0.07 I guess now one-time gain you asked us to include in your core last year, although it felt like it was smaller than $0.07 last year. I\u2019m just a little confused. Are you now asking us to restate that and take out the $0.07? Or what do you want us to do with that? And then the other question I had is about the 200 basis points that you\u2019re saving this quarter. Obviously that\u2019s good. Is that enough relative to the way your competitors are doing? It certainly sounds like you\u2019re going to be ramping up that savings number. How much higher do you think it ramps to and for how long? Jon Moeller : First, relative to the $0.07 gain, what we\u2019re asking you to do is just simply be aware of it. We\u2019re just providing that as an awareness point. What you do with that is obviously your call. But we like people to not be surprised, and that\u2019s simply why we\u2019re calling it out. It will be in our core numbers in the base, and will be reported as part of our core comparison. So we\u2019re not restating anything here. On savings, look, there\u2019s no amount of savings that\u2019s enough. Now, there is an amount of savings that\u2019s too much, when it starts cutting into capabilities for growth and those kinds of things. But we\u2019re going for everything we think is feasible and then asking ourselves is there more after that? And I\u2019m not going to speculate on the ultimate amount of savings, but I think as you\u2019ve seen both last year and this year, generally we\u2019re exceeding, as opposed to underdelivering, our savings targets. Last year we had $1.2 billion in cost of goods savings. That\u2019s about what we need to deliver the $10 billion objective this year. So far we\u2019re at about $1.4 billion. Last year we significantly overdelivered the SG&A enrollment, and this year we\u2019re committed to deliver our 2014 target and work to accelerate 2015 into 2014. And we really want to make this, as many of us have described before, an ongoing part of our business model, our culture, our ethos. And I think there\u2019s a lot of possibility, to the extent that we\u2019re able to accomplish that. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Connie Maneaty from BMO Capital Markets. Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets : I remember when A.G. first came back he was talking about the cost structure in some parts of the developed world still being too high. I\u2019m wondering where you stand on what sounded like it would be another more traditional type of bricks and mortar restructuring program that would run concurrently with the productivity initiative underway. Jon Moeller : That\u2019s what I was referring to in my prepared remarks relative to supply chain redesign in both North America and Western Europe, which is underway. It\u2019s in process, and we\u2019ll talk about it more as we kind of finalize our plans. But that is a significant opportunity to both reduce cost, improve cash through reduced inventory, and importantly, improve customer service, and we\u2019re pretty excited about that that opportunity. Basically, our supply chains in both of those markets have come about over years, and through a number of acquisitions. And this is an opportunity to step back and say, you know, if we were doing this over, how would we do this? What are the right levels of aggregation in terms of number of categories that are produced at a site? What are the right locations? How do you think about distribution opportunities serving existing customers and new customers? And so pretty excited about that opportunity, and we will bring more information to you as we finalize those plans. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Jason English from Goldman Sachs. Jason English - Goldman Sachs : I wanted to come back to beauty. You talked a little bit about the innovation slate coming up and some of the margin expansion. I wanted to drill down on the organic sales growth. You were showing signs of acceleration to year-end. We see deceleration despite the easy comp, and it also stands in contrast to what looks to be, in terms of U.S. consumption offtake, accelerating trends. Can you help us understand what drove that deceleration, whether there\u2019s anything transitory behind it, and maybe what\u2019s working and what isn\u2019t within that segment? Jon Moeller : First of all, this is a very competitive category. It\u2019s a category where I will readily admit we continue to have more work to do. So we\u2019re not yet where we want to be on this business. There are pieces of it that are working very well. Our personal cleansing business was up high single-digits on the quarter, our cosmetics business is doing extremely well, our deodorants business is doing extremely well. I mentioned Pantene. In several parts of the world it\u2019s doing well. We continue to need to make progress on North American Pantene, on Olay, and we need to make progress in our salon professional businesses. So those are kind of the strengths and the weaknesses, as it were, and we\u2019re fully focused on maximizing the opportunity behind the strengths and addressing the opportunities. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Olivia Tong from Bank of America Merrill Lynch Olivia Tong \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Want to talk a little bit about the share improvement. Obviously it continues. Where do you think that can top out at? Jon Moeller : Well, as I said several times on this call, we are in a very competitive market. Our expectation is that when we get everything working, we should be able to build a little bit of share each year. We\u2019re never going to be in a position where 100% of our business is building share at any given point in time. That\u2019s just not a realistic scenario in a very competitive industry that we compete in. We\u2019ve talked about targeting kind of two-thirds to 70% of the business growing share, holding or growing share, at any point in time, and that\u2019s the level that leads to modest share growth on an annual basis. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re targeting. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Javier Escalante from Consumer Edge Research. Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research : Question on the gross profit, or gross margin side. To what extent does a lot of what is happening have to do with the category mix in which basically the fabric and baby care are the two [unintelligible] that are leading the growth? And in that context, knowing that beauty and grooming are challenged, can you help us understand healthcare, why the deceleration beyond the recall of the pet food product? Jon Moeller : You\u2019re absolutely right, in terms of the drivers of part of the gross margin pressure. There\u2019s about 140 basis points of mix impact within that gross margin comparison. Approaching half of that is the product mix, exactly what you referenced, which is faster growth in lower gross margin businesses like fabric care and our paper businesses and slower growth in some of our higher gross margin businesses. In terms of healthcare, the real impact on the quarter was the recall on pet. The good news there is we\u2019re back up manufacturing full speed a perfectly great product. And so that should be in the past. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Joe Altobello with Oppenheimer. Joe Altobello - Oppenheimer : Just in terms of the portfolio, I think one of the things that A.G. has tried to hammer home the last three or four months has been that Procter needs to be more focused, and I think the word he\u2019s used a number of times is \u201cchoiceful.\u201d And so on that point, can you give us an example or examples of businesses where you believe you\u2019re underinvesting right now, and where you\u2019re overinvesting? And also, could you see yourself doing something like Unilever has done in the past, or like Kimberly-Clark has done more recently, where you actually pull out of certain geographies or categories in whole? And then also in terms of a housekeeping item, you mentioned that you held or gained share in two-thirds of your businesses. I think that was a global number. What was that number in the U.S.? Jon Moeller : The two word choices that you provided are accurate, focused and choiceful. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re all working to do here. Obviously you can appreciate from a competitive standpoint why I wouldn\u2019t want to lay over many cards right here in terms of where we\u2019ll accelerate investment or decelerate investment. But it is very much, as I said in our prepared remarks, a focus of ours, which is flowing investment to the areas, both businesses and geographies, where we believe we can create disproportionate value, and looking real hard at businesses where we\u2019re struggling to create value and looking to see if somebody else could potentially create more value than us. We have pulled out of regions in the past. We used to be in Asia, in the tissue/towel business. We used to be in Western Europe in the tissue/towel business. And we\u2019re now largely a North American tissue/towel business. And that was all driven by our assessment of our ability to create value in that industry, which we viewed as low potential. So these are things, both categories and geographies, that we\u2019ll continue to look at. And as we always have done, whether it\u2019s pharmaceuticals or Folgers or snacks, or the Western European tissue/towel business, where we determine that we can create more value on any business in a divestment context, there are two pieces of that. One is what our prognosis is going forward, the other is obviously we\u2019re not going to exit businesses in a value dilutive manner, so we need to have somebody who\u2019s willing to monetize some of that value they can create for our shareholders. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Bill Chappell from SunTrust. Bill Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Jon, you had talked I guess this morning on CNBC about Europe and kind of moving sideways. And I was just wondering if maybe you can give us a little more color there, because as you alluded to, a lot of other companies are seeing pockets of growth in certain areas, and didn\u2019t know if it really is just straight sideways, or if there\u2019s any sign of hope, or kind of just any color you have would be great. Jon Moeller : There are definitely areas that are stronger within Europe. I\u2019m not telling you anything you don\u2019t know. Northern Europe is certainly stronger than Southern Europe. Southern Europe continues to be a real struggle. And there are markets that are pockets of hope, if you will. But I want to step back on the whole Western European thing for a second. Changes in Western Europe in the consumer products category space have never been dramatic, and they continue to not be overly dramatic. You know, growth tends to oscillate between minus 1 and plus 1, and it\u2019s a good year when it\u2019s plus 1 and a bad year when it\u2019s minus 1. And we\u2019re not seeing significant departures from that aggregate picture. And so it continues to be an environment where we think we can build sales. We believe we can build profit and create value. It\u2019s an area that we\u2019re focused on. But we just don\u2019t see a rebound to date. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Jon Andersen from William Blair. Jon Andersen - William Blair : I\u2019m interested in asking about new channels, specifically the online channel. How important is the online channel to you today? What role does it play going forward? And are there distinct advantages to Procter from selling online? And I\u2019m thinking of things like increased consumption, reaching more consumers, or perhaps it\u2019s more profitable to sell through that channel. Jon Moeller : Well, we want our products to be available wherever, whenever, and however consumers want to shop. And there is certainly a segment of consumers in some categories that want to shop online, and we\u2019ll work to be available for them. The amount of our business that\u2019s currently in that channel varies by category. Still, as you would expect, the vast majority of our products are sold in traditional channels. And I think the channel offers several advantages, and several disadvantages, just as our other channels do. It\u2019s a very effective way to target consumers, both from a marketing standpoint and then conversion to purchase. So we\u2019ll continue to look at it from that standpoint. But we really want to be present and viewed as best in class in each of the retail channels. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Mark Astrachan from Stifel. Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus : Do you think the competitive environment is getting better or worse relative to your expectations? And I say this in the context of some of what I thought relatively provocative comments by your large competitor yesterday that it plans to rebase cost to fund investments. And sort of related to that, how do you think about the spending between promotional allowances and real advertising spend? I know you had mentioned that as a percentage of sales it would be up but less so absolutely as a percent? Jon Moeller : That\u2019s true of our aggregate marketing expense. Promotion expense in the July-September quarter, in terms of the percentage of our sales that moved on promotion, was actually down 7% versus a year ago. If you look at the total industry, it was about flat versus a year ago. So there are certain categories, certain items, certain competitors, where there may be an escalation in promotion, but it\u2019s not a broad characteristic of the environment, at least as we\u2019ve seen it to date. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Alice Longley from Buckingham Research. Alice Longley - Buckingham Research : A housekeeping question and then something else. Can you update us as to your category growth rates in emerging regions and the U.S.? And then could you break out the 2% organic sales growth that you had in the U.S. in terms of volume mix and price? And then my other question is the 140 basis point negative hit to gross margins from mix, are you expecting that to lessen as you go through the year? And maybe [by half]? Is that a significant part of the gross margin improvement you\u2019re expecting? Jon Moeller : In terms of market growth rates, broad strokes we see 1% growth in developed markets, about 7% in developing markets, and aggregate, developing markets ranged from kind of mid-single digits to low double-digits, depending on the region. And the developed markets range anywhere from 2% market value growth in North America to about a 1% decline, consistent with what I was saying earlier, in Western Europe. Relative to the 140 basis points mix impact and how that evolves going forward, as I mentioned in my response to Javier, about half of that is geographic and about half is product. And I would hope that over time, as we get our beauty business growing at market growth rates, the product portion of that would largely dissipate. I do expect we\u2019ll continue to have disproportionate growth in developing markets, and we\u2019re not yet to the point in terms of economic development where those margins will be equal to the balance of the rest of the world. So we will continue to see some drag on mix from a geographic standpoint. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Michael Stieb from Credit Suisse. Michael Stieb \u2013 Credit Suisse : I was wondering if you could give us some more detail on the volume decline in the grooming segment. Is that largely due to category weakness? Or is it from some share losses? Jon Moeller : The category in the last three months was about flat. I think it was a 99 index. We did lose a little bit of share in the latest quarter. That was primarily driven by disproportionate growth in the disposables section of the business, where we are less well-developed. The encouraging piece of it is that Fusion continued to grow share, and that\u2019s a good thing long term. And if you look over longer periods of time, last year for example we built share in blades and razors, and I would expect that would be more characteristic of the situation going forward. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Caroline Levy from CLSA. Caroline Levy - CLSA: Jon, if you could just go back to the North America share question, I don\u2019t think we got an answer. Just if you could give directionally where things were strongest and weakest. And specifically in cleaning materials, so Tide Pods, if you could just break out what happened on the pod side versus the liquid laundry side. Jon Moeller : Thanks for giving me a chance to recover there. Multipart questions, my feeble memory sometimes gets the best of me. In North America we\u2019re holding or growing share in businesses representing between two-thirds to 70% of sales. So that continues to hold up very nicely. I actually don\u2019t have segment level in terms of pods versus liquids versus powder shares in front of me here, but please feel free to call John or Katie or Brian during the balance of the day and they can get you that information. Operator : We have no other questions at this time. Jon Moeller : Thank you, everybody, for joining us this morning. As I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re reasonably happy with our first quarter results. In terms of its relation to our expectation, we know we still have more work to do. We\u2019re determined to do that, and we look forward to connecting with each of you soon. Thanks a lot.",

Today's discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections.  As required by Regulation G, P&G needs to make you aware that during the call, the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Management believes these measures provide investors valuable information on the underlying growth trends of the business. \u201cOrganic\u201d refers to reported results excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, where applicable. Free cash flow represents operating cash flow less capital expenditures. Free cash flow productivity is the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings.  Any measure described as \u201ccore\u201d refers to the equivalent GAAP measure, adjusted for certain items. P&G has posted on its website, www.pg.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP and other financial measures. Now, I will turn the call over to P&G\u2019s Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller. Jon Moeller : Good morning. Our October-December results came in pretty much as we had expected, keeping us on track to deliver our fiscal objectives. All-in sales were up modestly versus the prior year, including a 3-point headwind from foreign exchange. Organic sales grew at 3%. Organic sales were in line or ahead of year ago in each reporting segment. Coupled with 4% growth in the first quarter, this leaves us on track to deliver 3% to 4% organic sales growth for the fiscal year. Sales growth was driven by organic volume growth of 3%. Organic volume was ahead of a year ago in each of our reporting segments. Pricing added 1 point to sales growth and mix reduced sales growth by 1 point. Consistent with the reported market growth and market share data you\u2019ve seen, October and November were relatively soft months for our categories and for P&G. December, on the other hand, was a relatively strong month for us. December organic volume growth was over 5%, with each sector growing at or above 4%. Organic sales were up mid-single digits.  December quarter all-in GAAP earnings per share were $1.18, core earnings per share were $1.21, which leaves us on track with our plans to deliver 5% to 7% core earnings per share growth for the fiscal year. Earnings for all segments were ahead of a year ago, except for baby, feminine, and family care, due to foreign exchange.  Foreign exchange was an $0.11 per share headwind for the company in the quarter. The year ago period also included a $0.07 per share gain from the sale of our bleach business in Italy. Combined, these two items constitute a 15% core earnings per share growth headwind for the quarter.  Core operating margin was about equal to last year, down 10 basis points. Organic sales growth leverage and 230 basis points of cost of goods overhead and marketing savings were offset by foreign exchange and negative mix. Core gross margin was down 90%. Cost savings of 130 basis points and volume leverage were offset by geographic and category mix of 130 basis points, foreign exchange of 90 basis points, higher commodity costs, and higher manufacturing startup costs. Core SG&A improved 80 basis points, driven by 100 basis points of marketing and overhead productivity savings. These benefits were partially offset by foreign exchange imps and targeted innovation and go-to-market investments. The effective tax rate on core earnings was 21.5%. This included a positive 1 point impact from the release of a tax reserve following a favorable outcome in Asia. This reserve reversal accounted for roughly $0.02 of earnings per share benefit on the quarter. The net impact from all of the items below operating income, tax, interest expense, interest income, non-operating income, and supply chain, was a slight headwind to core earnings per share growth for the quarter. We generated $2.4 billion in free cash flow and remain on track to deliver free cash flow productivity of about 90% for the fiscal year. As planned, we returned $1.7 billion of cash to shareholders in dividends, and we repurchased $1.5 billion in stock, bringing year to date share repurchase to $4 billion. Net, the second quarter came in pretty much as we were expecting, on both the top and bottom lines, leaving us on track to deliver our sales and earnings forecast for the fiscal year. As we move forward, value creation for consumers and share owners remains our top priority. Operating TSR is our primary business performance measure. Operating TSR is an integrated measure of value creation at the business unit level, requiring sales growth, progress on gross and operating margin, and strong cash flow productivity. Operating TSR drives focus on core brands and businesses, our leading, most profitable categories, and leading, most profitable markets. We\u2019ll begin to make more operating TSR progress as we move into calendar 2014. Our strongest brands and business units and total company positions are in the United States. We need to continue to ensure our home market stays strong, and is growing. The actions we\u2019ve taken over the past two years to restore consumer value, expand our vertical product portfolios and horizontal regimens, and lead innovation have enabled us to restore value creating share growth in many parts of the business. We still have more work to do in a few categories, and the competitive environment is intense, which leads to choppy results on a quarter to quarter basis, but we\u2019re making good progress. We have a stronger brand and product innovation program ahead of us in the U.S. this quarter.  We continue to grow and expand our business in developing markets, with a focus on the categories and countries with the largest sizes of prize and the highest likelihood of winning. This is where the world\u2019s baby\u2019s will be born, and where more new households will be formed. Developing markets will continue to be a significant growth driver for our company this year and for years to come. In October/December, organic sales grew 8% in developing markets. We\u2019ll continue to focus the company\u2019s portfolio, allocating resources to businesses where we can create value. We\u2019ll continue to exit businesses where we determine that potential buyers with different capability sets can create more value than ourselves.  Consistent with our focus on operating TSR, we\u2019re continuing to push forward with our productivity and cost savings efforts. We\u2019ve made solid progress over the last fiscal year and a half. We have strong productivity plans for fiscal 2014, and we\u2019re working to accelerate some fiscal 2015 savings into 2014. Versus a target run rate of $1.2 billion, we\u2019re now forecasting more than $1.6 billion of cost of good productivity savings this fiscal year, across materials, logistics, and manufacturing expense. This is up $200 million since our last update. Versus a going-in target of 5%, we expect to improve manufacturing productivity by at least 6% this year. We\u2019re up more than 8% fiscal year to date. We\u2019ve now exceeded our 2014 fiscal year non-manufacturing enrollment reduction goals, only 6 months into the year, and have begun work to accelerate role reductions planned for fiscal 2015 into 2014. Our strict objective is to get substantially to our end of 2015 objectives by the end of 2014. This would put us close to, or within, the 16-22% reduction goal we\u2019ve established, 1 to 2 years ahead of target And we won\u2019t stop there. We continue to identify opportunities to simplify and streamline our organization design. We continue to drive marketing productivity and effectiveness through an optimized media mix, with more digital, mobile, and social presence, improved message clarity, and greater non-advertising marketing efficiencies. We expect absolute marketing spending to come in slightly above prior year levels, but marketing as a percentage of sales to decline. Importantly, the overall effectiveness and impact of our marketing spending will be well ahead of the prior year. We see several more years of effectiveness improvement ahead, driven by new, more efficient digital and social mobile media and big opportunities to continue to improve the efficiency, precision, and effectiveness of our communication. We remain committed to making productivity a core strength and a sustainable competitive advantage. We\u2019re equally committed to being the product and commercial innovation leader in our industry.  We\u2019re currently bringing significant innovation to market in fabric care, including upgrades on all of our Tide Plus value-added liquid detergents; new extra-large tub sizes on Tide Pods; Gain Flings, a triple-chamber, single-load laundry pack providing Gain consumers with enhanced scent, better freshness, and more cleaning power, all with the convenience of a single-load form; scent upgrades on Downy Unstoppables and Gain Fireworks in Wash Scent Beads; Tide Oxy, a multipurpose stain remover that can be used in the laundry or around the house; and Tide Simply Clean and Fresh laundry detergent, specifically designed with the right level of cleaning and freshness for mid-price-tier consumers.  We\u2019ve received strong retailer support for these innovations, overdelivering our distribution, shelving, and initial merchandising objectives for the launch. The Arial unit [dose] innovation in Western Europe is tracking well above expectations. We\u2019re continuing the expansion, launching in Italy, Iberia, and the Balkans earlier this month. Consumption trends on Tide Pods have remained strong, growing in the low teens fiscal year to date versus the prior year. We\u2019re also launching a very strong oral care innovation bundle next month, including Crest 3D White Brilliance, delivering our most advanced whitening and freshness benefits in one toothpaste; Crest 3D White Luxe, which removes up to 90% of tooth stains in five days, and with our new White Lock technology, locks out future stains and microfine lines in the teeth; Crest 3D White Luxe White Strips, with new Flexfit Film, an innovation created with technology from our baby care business, that stretches and molds for a custom fit for more whitening coverage; our new Crest Sensor Relief Innovation, which delivers improved sensitivity relief, combined with Scope freshness; and Crest B, a new line for experiential consumers, including flavors like B Dynamic, Lime Spearmint Zest, B Inspired, Vanilla Mint Spark, and B Adventurous Mint Chocolate Trek. In North America, our recent baby care absorbency, comfort, and design innovations are driving diaper market share growth. U.S. diaper share is up 1.5 points versus prior year, with particular strength on the Pampers, Swaddlers, and Luvs product lines, retaking market share and leadership for the first time in many years. We continue to strengthen our share position in the U.S. batter business behind the Quantum innovation and recent distribution increases. P&G batter value share is up 2.5 points for the past three months, to over 40%.  In December, we started shipping Pantene in North America, with improved product performance and packaging. The shampoo and conditioner formulas contain a new Pro-V antioxidant complex, delivering clinically proven healthier hair with every wash. We\u2019re also leveraging Pantene\u2019s Shine Strong advertising that has received global acclaim for tackling gender labels and encouraging women to show their strength and shine. The advertisement has generated nearly 1 billion consumer impressions globally.  We\u2019re expanding Old Spice into the rapidly growing North American male hair care segment behind a full array of shampoos, conditioners, and styling products, with Old Spice\u2019s most popular scent collections. This started shipping last week. Old Spice Body Spray is growing strongly behind the new Smellcome to Manhood commercial campaign. To date, the campaign has generated over 700 million consumer impressions, the vast majority of which have been free, through social media and mass media coverage. Duracell\u2019s Trust Your Power advertisement has also gained high awareness online. It features Derek Coleman, the only legally deaf player in the NFL, and the barriers he\u2019s overcome by trusting his inner power. The U.S. advertisement has driven over 1.7 billion consumer impressions in just two weeks, since it was launched on January 10. We recently launched our new commercial campaign for the Winter Olympics. The commercial program includes a balanced combination of single brand and multibrand executions. Our research shows stronger purchase intent is generated when individual brand executions are closely coupled with the multibrand execution. The Olympics ad campaign had generated nearly 1.6 billion consumer impressions so far, and like Old Spice and Duracell, most of these are earned or free impressions generated through traditional and social media. These product and commercial innovations should contribute to strong top line momentum in the back half which, combined with productivity savings, should enable us to deliver our fiscal year objectives. Next, we\u2019re improving execution and operating discipline. We simply have to execute better, more consistently and more reliably. We need everyone playing their position and playing it well. Consistent with the customer service improvements we discussed last quarter, we were recently named the top rated manufacturer in China, our second largest market, as rated by our retail partners and both the Advantage Group and Kantar Retail surveys. These surveys reflect the quality of our customer business development organization, promotion plans, and customer service reliability. Last, we\u2019re making strategic investments in innovation and go-to-market capabilities. Targeted R&D investments are enabling us to strengthen our near and midterm innovation pipeline. Targeted go-to-market investments will enable us to strengthen sales coverage in our fastest-growing markets and fastest-growing channels. We believe that the focus that we\u2019re bringing to these four areas : operating TSR, productivity, innovation, operational excellence, along with targeted reinvestment, will enable us to continue to improve results, even as we work to address several remaining opportunities. We remain on track to deliver our 2014 guidance, top line, bottom line, and cash. We\u2019re maintaining our organic sales growth range of 3% to 4%. Achieving organic sales growth in the upper half of our target range should result in modest overall market share growth. Foreign exchange is expected to be a sales growth headwind of 2 points, which leads to all-in sales growth in the range of 1% to 2% for the fiscal year. We\u2019re maintaining our forecast for bottom line core earnings per share growth of 5% to 7%, despite stronger headwinds from foreign exchange and softer market growth rates. We aim to make up the difference through productivity advances, which will primarily benefit the fourth quarter. The fiscal year headwind from foreign exchange has continued to increase. We now expect foreign exchange to be a 7-point headwind to core earnings per share growth. As a result, our guidance now translates to constant currency core earnings per share growth in the range of 12% to 14%. We now expect the tax rate on core earnings to be a point or so below prior year levels. On an all-in GAAP basis, we expect earnings per share to grow approximately 7% to 9%. This range reflects somewhat lower noncore restructuring costs in fiscal 2014 versus the prior year. The second half earnings growth increase that\u2019s implied within our guidance is driven by foreign exchange and cost structure improvement. Foreign exchange was a significant headwind in the first half but will moderate in the second half at recent spot rates. We\u2019ll also annualize the operating impacts from last year\u2019s Venezuelan bolivar devaluation. Manufacturing startup costs will annualize in the second half of fiscal 2014. Productivity savings and devaluation related price increases will build sequentially. As you prepare your estimates for Q3 and Q4, please keep in mind a couple of items.  We won\u2019t annualize the Venezuela impact until mid-February in Q3. We\u2019ll had a full quarter of laundry and oral care innovation impacts in Q4. Productivity savings that are being advanced to offset stronger FX impacts and lower market growth will primarily benefit the fourth quarter. Also, pricing that we\u2019ll be taking to offset recent devaluations in some markets will take effect only in Q4. We expect another year of about 90% free cash flow productivity. Our plans assume capital spending in the range of 4% to 5% of sales and share repurchase in the range of $5 billion to $7 billion.  In addition to the assumptions included in our guidance, we want to continue to be very transparent about some key items that are not included. The guidance we\u2019re reconfirming today is based on last week\u2019s FX spot rates. Further currency weakness is not anticipated within our guidance range. We continue to monitor unrest in Egypt, which is a large business for us and a base of export for the balance of Africa, as well as unrest in economic instability in the Ukraine, though the situation has recently improved. Venezuelan price controls, access to dollars for imported products, and devaluation present risk, as do import restrictions, price controls, and devaluation on Argentina. Finally, our guidance assumes no further degradation in market growth rates. Our first half results were in line with what we expected, putting us on track to deliver our goals for the fiscal year and make progress towards our long term growth objectives. We continue to operate in a volatile environment, with uncertainty in foreign exchange, some deceleration in market growth rates, and a rapidly developing policy environment. Against this backdrop, we\u2019ve maintained top line growth and improved constant currency operating earnings growth. We have an even stronger innovation program in the back half of the year and savings from productivity improvements that will build. We\u2019re making targeted investments in our core businesses, most promising developing markets, and biggest innovation opportunities, and are aggressively driving productivity and cost savings. Above all, we remain focused on value creation for consumers and for our share owners. That concludes our prepared remarks. As a reminder, business segment information is provided in our press release and will be available on slides, which we posted on our website, www.pg.com following the call. Our next significant investor event ahead of A.G. Lafley is the Cagney conference on February 20. We hope to see many of you there. I\u2019d be happy now to take your questions. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Chris Ferrara from Wells Fargo. Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo : John, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the cadence of the quarter. I think you mentioned that December was up 5%. Can you put that in the context of sell-in versus sell-through? What was going on in October/November? I think your shipments probably exceeded consumption by a reasonable margin in December. Why is that? How do you feel about inventory levels there? And then just if you can go through the same sort of cadence for the quarter for the emerging markets too, given all of the concern there, that would be great. Jon Moeller : You\u2019re certainly right in that the timing of innovation did affect the timing of shipments in the quarter. We\u2019re very comfortable with inventory levels currently, and offtake in January has been very encouraging. So we really do believe that there\u2019s strength behind the December numbers, and that that should carry through into the third quarter.  In developing markets, there really wasn\u2019t a significant difference in aggregate across the months of the quarter. We continue to see some softness in market growth rates, but there continues to be very strong growth overall, between 7% and 8% in the quarter we just completed, from a market standpoint. And we expect that to continue through the third quarter as well. So what we\u2019ve seen in OND, while presenting some challenges, leaves us confident as we head into JFM. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Faucher with JPMorgan. John Faucher - JPMorgan : Jon, as you look at the move to more local manufacturing, can you talk about the glide path that we should see in international operating margins over the next couple of years? It seems as though you exclude Russia and China, you\u2019re probably looking at maybe a high single-digit operating margin in your international business. And how long do you think it will take to see meaningful impact there? And then a related question, given the fact that you guys are still producing in some high-cost countries, and you\u2019re seeing this massive negative transactional impact, are you thinking now about potentially hedging transactional going forward? Jon Moeller : One of the big questions as it relates to glide path going forward on margins in developing markets, obviously is foreign exchange. But if you take that out, last year we were talking about growing profit ahead of sales growth. So improving margins on a constant currency basis in developing markets. We made pretty significant progress. This year is really the same story. On a constant currency basis, we\u2019ll grow earnings significantly ahead of the rate of sales growth. So I really can\u2019t, because I can\u2019t predict exchange, give you an exact glide path, but we should continue to make progress quarter on quarter, year on year, on those developing market margins as we, as you mentioned, localize manufacturing, but even more importantly as we continue to bring innovation to those markets, value creative innovation, which allows us to mix consumers up, which is happening pretty encouragingly in places like Brazil and places like China, in Russia.  So I said from the beginning that our developing market efforts, particularly as they\u2019re focused on the biggest opportunities with the highest chance of winning, should, over the long term, be a margin accretive endeavor, not a margin dilutive endeavor. And we continue to see that. As it relates to hedging, we\u2019ll continue to look for all opportunities to operationally hedge. And obviously, the localization of manufacturing is part and parcel of that effort. In terms of financial hedging, we continue to look at that periodically as well.  A lot of the FX impacts, though, frankly, are in nondeliverable currencies, whether it\u2019s in Egypt, Venezuela, Argentina, the Ukraine, etc., where there really isn\u2019t financial hedging option. And in many of the other markets, the interest rate differential is so high that even the cost of forward hedging gets pretty prohibitive.  And as you know, all that that does is buy time. As those instruments expire, we\u2019re right back to the issue that we started with, and I\u2019d rather, where we have the opportunity, solve the issue real time, up front. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley : John, beauty continued to drag down the organic sales growth number. The other divisions looked pretty solid. So I was hoping for more detail on how you plan to drive market share improvement going forward in beauty and when you think we\u2019ll start to see some improving share trends. And also, grooming, you mentioned market contraction in developed markets. Can you run through what\u2019s driving that? And what are your plans as the category leader to drive improved growth going forward, particularly on the innovation side? Jon Moeller : We continue to make progress on our efforts to strengthen the growth rates in beauty. And many parts of the beauty business are growing quite well. Personal care shipments, for instance, increased double digits in the quarter. Strong growth really in all regions. Up double digits in China, midteens in central and eastern Europe and more than 25% in Latin America.  Cosmetics we continue to do very well in. U.S. Cover Girl value share I think was up about 0.5 point in the quarter behind innovations like the Hunger Games Capital collection and the new Bombshell Volume mascara collection. Our antiperspirant and deodorant business continues to perform well, with U.S. deodorant value share up 1.5 points versus a year ago, driven by recent innovations on Secret, and as I mentioned, Old Spice. And then we come to haircare. Many parts of the haircare business are doing well. Head and Shoulders grew mid-single digits in the quarter, including double-digit growth in western Europe and central and eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.  Our biggest opportunity there is Pantene. I mentioned the innovation that\u2019s coming to market that we feel good about. We\u2019re feeling increasingly good about our overall equity and advertising campaign efforts, and as you know, as I mentioned, we\u2019ll also be expanding haircare into the young male segment behind the Old Spice brand. So we\u2019re hopeful that we\u2019re rounding the corner in haircare. On skincare, we still have some work to do, and that\u2019s going to take some time. So we share the impatience that exists externally. We know that we have more work to do, but we are comforted by the progress that we\u2019re making. On the question of developed markets, market growth and our responsibility as category leaders for market growth, the good news is that the developed markets are growing, albeit at a modest rate. It kind of oscillates somewhere between 0.5 point and 1 point of value growth per month. And within that, the better news is that where market growth is strongest in developed markets is in the U.S. and Japan. It\u2019s weakest in Europe. We are overdeveloped in both the U.S. and Japan, and so from a footprint standpoint relative to developed market growth, we\u2019re fairly well-positioned. We absolutely accept the responsibility for growing markets, in the categories where we\u2019re leaders and in the countries where we\u2019re leaders. And increasingly, our retail partners are looking at us as partners in that regard, to grow their business as well. We bring innovation that does grow markets. If you look at what\u2019s happened, for instance, with Crest 3D White and some of the other innovations, we bring innovation that increases trips and grows market baskets. So it is very much a part of our focus. It\u2019s actually more important in many places of the world than share. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citigroup. Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup: Just first a clarification. The 7-8% growth in emerging markets, less than 100 basis points of that I assume would be the benefit of new country or new category combination launches? So if you could just clarify that and make sure if that\u2019s a real sort of same-store sales number, or close to it. And then my second question is, with regard to what AG has talked about, the sort of strength to grow, and I know you said you\u2019re looking for partners who can grow your businesses better maybe than you can, are you entertaining full brand divestitures? Or is there the possibility too of just sort of country category combination exits, kind of like what Kimberly\u2019s doing, getting out of diapers in western Europe? Is that the stuff you\u2019re entertaining as well? Jon Moeller : From a developing market growth standpoint, the vast majority of that 8% growth in developing markets that we posted in the latest quarter is, if you will, same country, same category, apples to apples growth rate. I don\u2019t know exactly, but I would guess that the impact of any new white space businesses is well below a point. So that should be a pretty good number and representative of the progress that we\u2019re making. And on divestitures, historically, if you look at our efforts in this space, where we determine we can\u2019t create value, whether that is at a category country combination level or a brand level, we\u2019ve looked at other options. So in the past, historically for instance, we exited the family care business, the tissue/towel business, in various parts of the world because we just didn\u2019t see, at that point, a financial structure and an industry structure where we could sustainably create value for our shareholders. We did the same, as you know, in several categories recently, from pharmaceuticals, to coffee, to snacks, to water purification, and in some markets the bleach business. And rather than point to specifics, because as you know this is something we really only want to talk about when we have something to talk about, I\u2019ll just reassure you that - hopefully it\u2019s reassuring - that as I mentioned, everything we\u2019re looking at is through the lens of value creation and there\u2019s nothing that\u2019s off the table. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank. Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank : Just a follow up, what was the percentage of market share that the holding are gaining both in the U.S. and globally? I don\u2019t think I caught that. And the the growth rate in developed markets? I know you gave us the emerging markets number. And then my real question is clearly the March quarter has been a troubling one for P&G historically. So can you just give us some more color? I know you gave us some data points. And it seems like, as we look at the back half of the year, it\u2019s really going to be fourth quarter weighted. But I know you don\u2019t want to give quarterly guidance, but maybe your comfort level and kind of where estimates are now, the Street consensus, that would be very helpful. Jon Moeller : Percentage of business holding and growing share is down a bit from where we were last quarter. And that\u2019s primarily driven by two items. One is fabric care in the U.S., the other is haircare in the U.S., both of which are big businesses, which are growing share, and where we lost a little bit of share in the OND quarter. Both of those categories are items that we highlighted going into the quarter as likely going to be experiencing a significant amount of competitive activity, particularly promotional activity, ahead of our launches in both of those categories, which are just happening now. So the decline in percentage of business holding or growing share is really driven by those two things, which we expected going in, and we\u2019re very comfortable that both of those businesses, from a share standpoint, will strengthen as the innovations hit the market.  Just for perspective, if you look at, for example, Lever\u2019s percent volume sold on promotion in haircare, in OND, it was up about 6% versus the prior year. If you look at some of our laundry competitors, percent volume sold on promotion in the OND quarter, it was up over 20% versus a year ago. So again, these were things that we called out going into the quarter, things that we expected, and it\u2019s all ahead, encouragingly, of very strong innovation that\u2019s now just hitting shelves. Your second part of your question, on developed market growth rates, we were about flat, slightly ahead, in developed markets. So the total is 8% developing, flat or just a little bit ahead in developed. And relative to the March quarter, I think your statement in terms of fourth quarter predominance is correct, and it\u2019s consistent with the various impacts that I was calling out in terms of when the different pieces are going to fall in place. Having said that, I expect us to make good progress in the JFM quarter, on both the top and bottom line. But as you think about the modeling across the quarters, it will be fourth quarter loaded. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays Capital. Lauren Lieberman - Barclays : The first was just on healthcare. Very big volume number, and then weaker mix impact. So just curious if that was primarily because of the expansion of the personal healthcare business in emerging markets, or if there\u2019 something else driving it. And then the other question was just perhaps a bit nit-picky, but I was reading through the release yesterday that you guys put out about Gain Flings, and it just struck me as a little bit too reminiscent of some of the innovation in the last two or three years, where it\u2019s like this massive bundling of benefits into one product. So it\u2019s Gain Flings with great cleaning power, amazing scent, plus Oxy, plus Febreze. It reads like it\u2019s like 10 people sat in a room and couldn\u2019t make up their minds which was the most important benefit.  So I just would love some clarification maybe on the thought process, on why so much in one product, where the form should speak for itself, and how this is or isn\u2019t different from the innovation you guys have been putting out over the last two or three years in terms of that messaging. Jon Moeller : The healthcare difference between the sales line and the volume line is really just category mix more than anything. And John can give you the details on that later today. Sorry, I don\u2019t have that level of detail right here in front of me. But that\u2019s primarily what\u2019s driving it. On Gain Flings, you know, if you think about it, when we brought Tide Pods to market, which has been extremely successful, that was a multibenefit proposition too. It was not only the form, it was a better cleaning product. So it was an upgrade, from that standpoint, as well. And obviously nothing comes to market without a lot of work to understand what will delight consumers, and what they\u2019ll be willing to pay for that, and that certainly is the case here as well. Early both customer and consumer reaction to the proposition has been very positive. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with BoA. Olivia Tong - Bank of America : I wanted to ask about grooming margins, because they were up significantly year over year after being down in Q1. So going forward, is Q1 or Q2 more indicative of going forward? And is this due more to timing of some cost savings initiatives or promotions or innovation? Or is there something structurally different, so that profit growth will continue? Jon Moeller : It\u2019s hard to draw meaningful understanding from one quarter\u2019s worth of margin increase or decrease in any one of our categories. There\u2019s a lot going on out there, whether it\u2019s foreign exchange, whether there\u2019s pricing in some markets. The cost savings program is itself not ratable. It moves up and down across quarters. So I would encourage you to look more, call it 12 months, at margin trends as being indicative of what\u2019s happening there. We\u2019re reasonably happy with our margins on that business. That doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re satisfied and we won\u2019t stop working, both on the productivity point and on the innovation point, to improve margins in a way that\u2019s value accretive for consumers. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets : Just a quick question, if you could provide some perspective on some of the transitions that took place in leadership in R&D with Bruce retiring. Just curious on the replacement, any thoughts on changes in terms of processes within the innovation group. Any thoughts there would be much appreciated. Jon Moeller : Kathy Fish will be taking R&D leadership for the company. She has a long track record of innovation success and consumer delight across a number of our businesses and across the global portfolio. So we\u2019re very excited to see Kathy taking that responsibility. We just announced this recently. She and Bruce are in transition, and I wouldn\u2019t want to presume any changes in emphasis that she will choose, working a AG and others, to make at this point. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj from Bernstein. Ali Dibadj - Bernstein : A couple of things. One is on beauty. We haven\u2019t really heard much about what you need to do to fix Olay. And I wonder sometimes whether you actually need to acquire something in that business, because it really is your only skincare brand, to backstop that business. So I\u2019d love a perspective on that. And then secondly, when we do see the beauty margins go up, I understand that a quarter doesn\u2019t make a trend, but at least to a broader question that I have, which is when do you expect that crossover point to happen as a company, where the productivity savings ramp up to above your investment level? And if you could talk about that crossover point as you see it going forward, in the context of some of the supply chain work you guys are doing internally, that would be helpful. Jon Moeller : The great part of the Olay story is that that remains an incredibly strong equity, with very high equity scores, very high net promoter scores, the highest in the category. So from an equity standpoint, it doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t do more work, but we start with a very strong asset. And really, from a product standpoint as well. We have a very competitive product. But the work to do is in brand architecture, it\u2019s in packaging, it\u2019s in positioning the various properties in a way that is most relevant for consumers. And it\u2019s entering some benefit segments that we\u2019ve, frankly, neglected. And those are growing faster than the benefit segment that we\u2019re in. It also involves ensuring we reach consumers at different ages, which is part of what we were trying to do with the Olay Fresh Effects item. Now, this is going to take some time, as I said before. But I would feel much more concerned sitting here if this was an equity problem or a fundamental competitive product problem, which it\u2019s not. In terms of crossover point, back half, and the supply chain work, we\u2019ll talk a little bit more about it at Cagney. We continue to be encouraged about the opportunity to potentially replatform most of our supply chain in both North America and Europe to do really several things.  One is, as you mentioned, to bring in savings, but also to get to standard platforms across the world, which allows for faster initiative expansion, to get closer to our customers with multicategory manufacturing facilities in a way that allows us to serve them better. And it\u2019s something that we\u2019re really just beginning the work on. I don\u2019t see it having a material impact, say, in the next 12 months. This is going to take a while, both to think through and to execute. But it should enable us to bring in a new round of savings in addition to the savings we\u2019ve been talking about over the last 18 months. But that\u2019s probably two or three years out. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English - Goldman Sachs : Thanks for the incremental color on beauty. I want to drill a bit deeper on laundry. A few questions. First, on Europe, it sounds like Arial Pods are off to a good start, but Nielsen data suggests you\u2019re still struggling in the market. So what are the offsets there? Second, with the launch upon us, can you give us more detail behind the merchandising location and targeted price points for Simply? And lastly, what signs are you looking for to gauge when or if the U.S. market will be ready for the next round of compaction? Jon Moeller : Well, it seems like Ali has now trained all of you well. You all ask three-part questions. [laughter] First of all, on Simply, the price is ultimately the sole discretion of our retail partners. But generally, we\u2019re expecting that to be about 30%, on a list price basis, below current Tide. Compaction is something that we are always looking at as an opportunity, actually across categories, beyond laundry. And if you think about it, we\u2019re really actively doing that as we sit here, because the unit dose offering, whether it\u2019s Tide or Arial or now Gain, is the most compact form that exists in the marketplace today, and as more of the market converts to that, it has all the benefits of a standard compaction in terms of lower cost, better value equation for the retailer, better value equation for consumers.  And in terms of the question on Europe, really where we\u2019ve lost a little bit of business is in liquids, where we\u2019re responding to heavy competitive promotion levels. So it\u2019s just a very competitive marketplace, which makes sense, as we bring in Pods and people are emphasizing the other parts of their portfolio. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Connie Maneaty from BMO Capital Markets. Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets : I am just going to have to question on Venezuela, and that is as we contemplate another pretty steep devaluation, has there been any change in the policy there about prices? Have you been able to work around any of the pricing restrictions? And do you see any easing of that coming? Jon Moeller : That\u2019s a very good question. Currently, there are price controls in place. That doesn\u2019t mean that there won\u2019t be opportunities to take pricing. The level of pricing is reviewed regularly by the government, and we\u2019re obviously in discussions with them. And I would say that they understand the need for some level of pricing for both international and local competitors to remain viable. Also, the price controls that exist apply to a portion of the portfolio, not to all. It\u2019s what\u2019s referred to as regulated items, where the pricing controls are relevant. And there are unregulated items where there\u2019s more pricing flexibility. So we continue to work to improve our financial situation in Venezuela, which starts off from a very attractive place to begin with, but your question is an appropriate one as we look forward. To the extent that there\u2019s more devaluation, will there be more pricing that\u2019s allowed?  And that\u2019s just something I don\u2019t have the answer to today. It\u2019s something that we\u2019ll be very transparent about and keep you updated on. And that question is one of the reasons I continue, as I talk about guidance, to hold that item out, if you will, because I have no way of forecasting exactly what the puts and calls are going to be. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Javier Escalante from Consumer Edge Research. Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research : Question on the negative mix, again. I would like to ask it from a planning standpoint. Could you tell us whether the commitments that the [DBUs] presented back in August, when you created the fiscal \u201914 plan, could you tell us whether beauty and grooming are meeting their plans, considering this very negative gross margin mix? And if they don\u2019t, which DBUs are being asked to overdeliver in light of the reiteration of the corporate outlook for the balance of the year? Or does the plan assume that beauty and grooming are going to accelerate and therefore the negative mix to improve in the next couple of quarters? Jon Moeller : On a macro point, in terms of delivery versus expectation, we\u2019ve been talking about, on the top line, a mix impact of one or two points going forward, and this last quarter was one point, so pretty much in line with what we expected, as was last quarter. Each of the businesses has a strong commitment to deliver their plan that creates value for consumers and for shareholders.  But equally, each of them is looking out for the company and is willing to help out where that\u2019s needed. As hard as you can imagine, going into a year, knowing exactly what\u2019s going to occur during the course of that year, particularly given the volatility in FX, some of the policy volatility, commodity costs, which are up more in some categories than other categories. And so that\u2019s an equation that gets constantly rebalanced. But I can tell you that no one in any category is giving up. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello with Oppenheimer. Joe Altobello - Oppenheimer : Just wanted to go back to beauty for a second. I think in terms of the question from Ali, you mentioned that you don\u2019t think it\u2019s an equity problem, and I would probably agree with that. But is it a portfolio problem? Do you think that you\u2019re still missing that brand that you could sort of slide in between, let\u2019s say, SK-II and Olay for example, on the skincare side in particular? Is there something you could do there to address that?  And then more secondly, in terms of overall beauty, if you look at the successful companies in this space, most of them are pure play. So is it a different mindset and culture that\u2019s really required to succeed in that business than, say, versus fabric and home care, for example? Jon Moeller : Thanks for reminding me of that part of Ali\u2019s question. Sorry that I missed that. In terms of additional equities that may be brought to bear in skincare, it\u2019s something that we look at routinely. It\u2019s certainly not something that we\u2019ve crossed off the list. But also, I think you shouldn\u2019t then therefore assume that \u201cwe need to make an acquisition\u201d in order to get skincare growth back to where it needs to be. There are opportunities on both Olay and SK-II, and there are opportunities if we need to create equities or properties organically. But if you think about Olay, really that\u2019s a series of properties that were created organically, from Total Effects to Regenerist, to ProX. And so I think the question is a good one, and yes, we may need additional properties, whether under existing brands or new brands, but I wouldn\u2019t necessarily therefore conclude that we need to acquire in order to make that happen. In terms of the capabilities and skill sets that are required to grow a successful beauty business, if you just step back a bit here, over the last 20 years, Procter & Gamble, with its skill sets and capabilities, has built the largest and most profitable beauty company in the world. If you look at what we were able to do with brands like Pantene, like Olay, like Old Spice, like SK-II, like Hugo Boss, LaCoste, Head & Shoulders is another good example, that literally started out as very small kind of one-country, two-country, less than $100 million in sales businesses, and now are, in some cases, multibillion dollar businesses, category leaders, global leaders, in their categories, wouldn\u2019t indicate that we don\u2019t have the basic skill set and confidence required to develop and grow a beauty business. Having said that, we are not arrogant in our ways and believe that we have all the answers. We have significant partnerships, many partnerships, externally, which give us access to other thinking in the beauty space, whether that\u2019s in the packaging arena, whether that\u2019s in the ideation and conceptualization arena, the equity arena. And we\u2019re also not averse to where there\u2019s very strong talent that needs a specific skill [outage], to bring that in from the outside. If you look at most of our design group, and that applies to both beauty and the balance of the company, was brought in from other companies, other situations, with the knowledge that that was an important capability, that we weren\u2019t able to source sufficiently internally. So we will take any help that exits, wherever it exists, but I\u2019m pretty confident we have the abilities across our internal resources and our external partners to keep making progress in this space. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell from SunTrust. Bill Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : First, on the other Bill\u2019s question, I missed the actual percentage in North America and the rest of the world of held or gained market share. And then second, you talked about kind of being ahead of plan on the cost savings, cost of goods sold, restructuring and pulling some of that forward from 2015, yet obviously there\u2019s no change to your EPS guidance. Is that just conservatism? Is that we\u2019re spending more back into promotion and marketing with some of these launches? Or is that just FX is a little bit different from what you thought? Jon Moeller : Back to numbers, on market share, overall market share was about flat in the quarter. And percent holding or growing, I don\u2019t have the exact numbers, it was probably 55ish. So that\u2019s the market share numbers, both of which we expect will improve as we head into the back half of the year. In terms of the acceleration of productivity savings, I\u2019d say there are two motivations for that, maybe three. The first is we want to make productivity part of our culture, and just like we never ask the question in P&G what is enough innovation, we don\u2019t like asking the question of what is enough productivity.  We\u2019ll always be endeavoring to become more productive, and we\u2019re doing that for multiple reasons. There\u2019s the financial reason, obviously, but there\u2019s also speed to market, clarity of decision making, organization transaction costs, etc. So if we were in a position where FX was a tailwind, we\u2019d be looking to accelerate productivity savings into the current year and identify the next round.  The second motivation is exactly as you described, which is that FX, as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, has had a bigger impact, a significantly bigger impact, than we had been expecting. And as you know, at the margin, while market growth still offers ample opportunity for all the best competitors to succeed, it is down somewhat from what we were expecting when we went into the year. And as you\u2019ll remember, when we started talking about productivity, this is exactly the kind of thing we were working to be able to do, which was offset, as one of the objectives, macro-level developments without having to compromise our earnings objectives. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alice Longley from Buckingham. Alice Longley - Buckingham Research : I\u2019m thinking, based on your comments about what\u2019s happening in developing versus developed world, that trends and mix and price are quite different in the two regions. So could you take your 0% to 1% growth in developed markets and your 8% growth in developing markets and break those down into mix, price, and volume? And then as the second part of that, will mix and pricing get better do you think, in the U.S. in the second half than in the first half? Jon Moeller : Let me just give you, and I think you can get the rest of it, the volume growth rates in developed, which was 1%, and developing was 6%. So the mix dynamics, pricing dynamics, aren\u2019t that different between the two, though obviously there are some differences between them. But those are the volume numbers. You have the sales numbers, and I think you can deduct the balance. In terms of going forward, every problem is a significant opportunity, and any acceleration in the developed market business growth rates represents an opportunity to improve mix going forward. And clearly, to the extent we continue to make the progress we\u2019re making on beauty, as an example, that\u2019s an opportunity to improve mix going forward. And each of our businesses has its own opportunity to improve mix through value accretive innovation.  And so while we expect that the developing, developed market dynamic will be prevailing - in other words, we still will have some negative mix going forward - there are many reasons to believe that the magnitude of that impact can lessen over time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan from Stifel. Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus : I wonder if you could talk a bit broadly about expectations for level of competitive activity in the back half of the fiscal year, and how we should think about the split between gross margin and SG&A expense leverage to drive the operating margin that\u2019s expected. Jon Moeller : I expect that in an environment of growth but modest growth, that competitive activity will remain strong. But the biggest antidote to that kind of situation is innovation. The first half innovation program was fairly strong, behind the baby care innovation, the tissue/towel innovation, batteries innovation, and the laundry innovation on a global basis, and that just builds as we go forward, with some of the things I talked about and frankly some of the things I haven\u2019t talked about yet. So competing on the basis of innovation is something that is much more comforting than not, and we\u2019re in a good position in that regard. I think the other thing that oftentimes is missed, particularly in a developing market context, but also in developed markets, and it goes to the point of one of the questions that was asked earlier about market size, we really don\u2019t look at this as a zero sum game. There\u2019s enough growth for all of the better companies to continue to do well, and there are opportunities to grow markets, to create new businesses, to build markets. And think about developing markets, for example. It\u2019s really not about share, it\u2019s about market. And more competition tends to be accretive from a market growth standpoint. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy from CLSA. Caroline Levy - CLSA : Just going back to beauty margins, they seem to be as high as they\u2019ve been in many years in the quarter. If you could help us understand that. I know you said we should look at it on an annual basis, but a couple of quarters now where margins are actually going up, while the business itself is challenged. Is that a trend that we should expect to continue, the margin growth in beauty and grooming, beauty in particular, while you\u2019re improving things and working to turn around Olay and Pantene? And then secondly, if you could just break out the volume growth in China. You said it was very strong, but if you could talk about your six major categories, if there were any standouts there? Jon Moeller : First, on beauty, I think the question behind the question is efficiency of support for the growth of that business, and we are comfortable with the levels of support. As I mentioned, we\u2019re working to increase the effectiveness and the strength behind that effectiveness of our advertising and marketing programs across the business, and that\u2019s obviously relevant in beauty as well. And so it gets more difficult to look just at dollar trends and spending and assess sufficiency of support. So we\u2019re very comfortable we\u2019re supporting the new innovations we\u2019re bringing to market heavily. And there\u2019s no reason that, if that\u2019s the case, we shouldn\u2019t be looking to take productivity savings to the bottom line. It\u2019s a balance, always, and it will continue to be a balance, but you\u2019re starting to see, in those numbers, the reflection of very strong productivity progress, which is a good thing. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Leigh Ferst of Wellington Shields. Leigh Ferst - Wellington Shields : You made several references to your digital ad spending. Could you give us a little more insight into it in the aggregate? Is it a third of your spending? And what kind of impact does that have on your impressions, and what impact will it have on your future spending on an absolute and relative basis, relative to sales? Jon Moeller : We are continuing to increase our presence in the digital, social, and mobile spaces, as it relates to marketing. The percent that is in those media, or channels, is different by category. In total, I think we\u2019re probably about or getting close to 30% of the spending being in those areas. It does offer, based on what we\u2019re seeing today, higher return potential.  And that\u2019s why the shift is occurring. And you heard me talk in the prepared remarks about some of the dynamics of digital, social, and mobile media in terms of earned impressions, and that\u2019s one of the reasons that we\u2019re seeing higher returns in that space. And a huge number of those impressions were not paid for by us. The other aspect of those channels and media is that it allows very effective and tighter targeting of a message to a consumer. If you think very simplistically about men and women, if you\u2019re advertising on TV in particular, depending on what shows you\u2019re on, that\u2019s going to everybody, and we can much more carefully target content to recipient in a digital environment.  So I expect that will continue to be an area of focus as we move forward, but I really do think this is a world of and not of or, and we\u2019re really looking at comprehensive campaigns across media that consumers want to access. Operator : We have no further questions at this time. Jon Moeller : Thank you very much. John, myself, the rest of the team, are available at your convenience the balance of the day.",

Today's discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections. As required by Regulation G, P&G needs to make you aware that during the call, the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Management believes these measures provide investors valuable information on the underlying growth trends of the business. \"Organic\" refers to reported results excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, where applicable. Free cash flow represents operating cash flow less capital expenditures. Free cash flow productivity is the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings. Any measure described as \"core\" refers to the equivalent GAAP measure, adjusted for certain items. P&G has posted on its website, www.pg.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP and other financial measures. Now, I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller. Jon Moeller : Thanks, and good morning. Our January-March results came in as we had expected, keeping us on track to deliver our fiscal year objectives. All-in sales were unchanged, versus the prior year, including a three point headwind from foreign exchange. Organic sales grew more than 3% in a very challenging macro environment, with significant market level events in places like Venezuela, Argentina and the Ukraine, declining levels of market growth in both the developed and developing world and weather-related issues in North America. Organic sales were at or above prior year levels in each of our five reporting segments. Organic sales growth was driven by strong organic volume growth of 3%. Volume was at or above prior year levels in each of our five reporting segments. Pricing added one point to sales growth and mix reduced sales growth by one point. Fiscal year-to-date, we deliver between 3% and 4% organic sales growth, leaving us on track to deliver 3% to 4% organic sales growth for the fiscal year. : Core gross margin declined 110 basis points, cost savings of 200 basis points, pricing and volume leverage were offset by product category and geographic mix of 150 basis points, foreign exchange headwinds of 100 basis points and higher commodity costs. Core SG&A improved 130 basis points driven by marketing efficiencies and overhead productivity savings. Importantly therefore, core operating margin increased 20 basis points. Core earnings per share grew 5% to $1.4, leaving us on track to deliver 3% to 5% core earnings per share growth for the fiscal year. Foreign exchange was at $0.12 per share headwind for the company on the quarter. Excluding foreign exchange, core earnings per share grew 17%. The effective tax rate on core earnings was about 20%. Tax accounted for roughly $0.03 of earnings per share benefit on the quarter versus the prior year. We generated $3.2 billion in free cash flow, achieving 119% free cash flow productivity, and remaining on track to deliver free cash flow productivity of about 90% for the fiscal year. As planned, we returned to 1.7 billion of cash to shareholders in dividends. We also announced a 7% increase in our dividend. P&G has now been paying a dividend for 124 consecutive years since its incorporation in 1890. This is the 58th consecutive year the company has increased its dividend. We repurchased $1.5 billion in stock bringing year-to-date share repurchase to 5.5 billion. Stepping back, we are satisfied with our top line growth, particularly against the difficult macro backdrop. Constant currency earnings progress was very strong. We're reliably converting earnings to cash, and are building on a strong track record of cash returned to shareholders. As we move forward, value creation for consumers and shareowners remains our top priority. Operating TSR is our primary business performance measure. Operating TSR is an integrated measure of value creation at the business unit level, requiring sales growth, margin progress and strong cash flow productivity. Operating TSR drives focus on core brands and businesses, our leading, most profitable categories, and leading, most profitable markets. Our strongest brands and business units and total company positions are in the U.S. We need to continue to ensure our home market stays strong and growing. The actions we've taken over the past two years to restore consumer value, expand our vertical product portfolios and horizontal regimens, and lead innovation have enabled us to restore value creating share growth in more parts of the business. We still have a lot more work to do, and the competitive environment is intense, which leads to choppy results on a quarter-to-quarter basis, but we're making steady progress. We'll continue to grow and expand our business in developing markets, with a focus on the categories and countries with the largest sizes of prize and the highest likelihood of winning. This is where the world's babies will be born, and where more new households will be formed. Developing markets will continue to be a significant growth driver for our company this year and for years to come. We'll continue to focus the company's portfolio allocating resources to businesses where we can create value. Over the past six years, we exited businesses that have accounted for over $6 billion in sales, including coffee, pharmaceuticals, snacks, kitchen appliances and water purification. Last quarter, we announced our exit from the bleach business. Two weeks ago, we announced our plan to exit the pet food business. Mars will buy our business in the Americas and several other countries. We expect to sell the European business to a different buyer. The $2.9 billion purchase price Mars has agreed to pay for the nine European business represents a 1.8 times multiple of sales and an 18X multiple of EBITDA on an average of the past two year's sales and profits for the global pet food business. We'll begin the process of selecting a buyer for the European market in May; early interest in this asset is strong. We'll continue to exit businesses where we determine that potential buyers with difficult capability sets can create more value than ourselves. Consistent with our focus on operating TSR, we're continuing to drive productivity and cost savings. We made solid progress over the last fiscal year and a half. We have strong productivity plans for fiscal 2014, and we're accelerating some 2015 savings into 2014. Versus a target run rate of $1.2 billion, we are now forecasting about $1.6 billion of cost of goods productivity savings this fiscal year across materials, logistics and manufacturing expense. Versus a going-in target of 5%, we expect to improve manufacturing productivity by at least 6% this year. We're up more than 7% fiscal year-to-date. At the CAGNY conference, we announced the complete redesign of our end-to-end supply chain in North America. We operated 35 manufacturing facilities in North America today, only six of which are multi-business or multi-category. We're consolidating operations into multi-category sites, located closer to the customers and consumers we serve, allowing us to respond quickly to their needs and provide better service at the best possible cost. We're examining the potential for similar improvements in Europe. At the same time, we are converting to common manufacturing and technology platforms for faster innovation, qualification and expansion. We are designing supply systems to allow for more online product differentiation and customization. We're also transforming our distribution operations, consolidating customer shipping and product customization operations into fewer distribution centers, which are strategically located closer to key customers and key population centers, enabling 80% of the business to be within one day of the store shelf and the shopper. All of this would drive step change improvement and responsiveness, reducing out of stocks, taking down inventory and lowering cost. It leverages the scale and scope of our production and distribution network in a way we've never done before. Savings from this transformation will accrue over three to four years, and should be in the range of $200 million to $300 million annually, which will be incremental to the $6 billion of cost of good savings we previously communicated. We expect additional top and bottom-line benefits from improved service levels. Turning to overhead, we have exceeded our 2014 fiscal year non-manufacturing enrollment reduction goals, and have accelerated over a thousand role reductions originally planned for fiscal 2015 into 2014. Through March, we're down 8000 roles or 13%. Our strict objective is to get substantially to our end of 2015 objectives by the end of 2014. This would put us close to, or within, the 16% to 22% reduction goal we've established one to two years ahead of target. Underpinning this progress are some important and fundamental changes in our organization structure and focus. We've organized into four industry-based sectors or global business units. The businesses in each sector are focused on common consumer benefits and needs. They share common technologies. They partner with common customers and common trade channels, and they face common competitors. These sectors or global business units are big enough for scale and small enough to stay in touch with consumers and markets and move with the agility and flexibility to consistently grow value. We've made a significant clarification in roles and announced a significant de-duplication of effort between the GBUs and the go-to-market operations. GBUs will create design, manufacture and market our brands and products. They will be the focus of brand building at the global, regional and local levels. Brand franchise building resources will be in the GBUs. We've changed the name of our go-to-market organizations from MDO to SMO, Sales and Market Operations. This is more than a name change; it clarifies the work SMOs need to do in the work they do best, superior, effective and efficient, selling, distribution, shelving, pricing execution and merchandizing; every day, every week and every store. Selling resources will be concentrated in the SMOs. We're aggregating the SMOs to be more logically focused on the consumers, channels, customers and markets we serve. We're merging western, central and eastern Europe into one European organization. We're merging India, the Middle East and Africa into one IMEA region. We're more fully integrating Greater China, ASEAN, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and Korea into one Asia SMO region over the next year. Within the SMOs, we'll aggregate countries at a higher level, reducing the number of geographic country clusters to about 25, a 20% reduction versus today. And back in the GBUs, we're moving from four disaggregated brand building functions; design, consumer and market understanding, communications and marketing into one integrated brand building or brand management organization. We have embedded resources that are required to win in the GBUs and SMOs, reducing the size of the standalone support functions, following those resources to work and outsourcing more of their activities. The changes I just described are significant. They will reduce interfaces and transaction costs, clarify who is accountable for what, de-duplicate effort and simplify operations. These changes will enable us to operate with more agility and speed, to operate with clear accountability and effectiveness, and to operate at a lower cost that will also enable further enrollment reduction. Moving next to marketing expense, we continue to drive marketing effectiveness and productivity through an optimized media mix with more digital mobile search and social presence, improved message clarity and greater non-advertising marketing efficiency. We expect marketing spending to come in below prior year levels, due to productivity improvements in non-working marketing and advertising cost. Importantly, the overall effectiveness and the consumer impact over advertising spending will be well ahead of the prior year. While acknowledging the progress I've just described across cost of goods, overhead and marketing, you maybe asking yourself \"Where have all the savings gone?\" This year, a disproportionate number of them have gone to offset FX. We have leading positions in some of the markets where currencies have soften the most, Japan, Venezuela, Ukraine, Russia and Turkey. As I mentioned earlier, January to March earnings per share would be 17% ahead of a year ago on a constant currency basis. Year-to-date, constant currency core earnings per share is up 11%. Partially as a result of devaluation or the same significant wage inflation in developing markets, which we also need to offset, and we're making targeted investments and innovation and then selling covers drive growth. The majority of the offset though has been FX, which hopefully will annualize and will be partially offset by pricing. As more savings come online and we see several more years of significant opportunity, we will get a greater percent reinvested in growth or brought to the bottom line. We're committed to make productivity a core strength and a sustainable competitive advantage. We're equally committed to maintaining innovation leadership in our industry. Innovation and productivity are the two most powerful and sustainable ways we can drive value creation for consumers and shareholders. The IRI Pacesetter results for calendar year 2013 demonstrate our commitment to leading innovation. P&G launched seven of the top 10 non-food U.S. consumer product innovations in 2013 with Tide Pods topping the list. In addition, six P&G innovations were included in their list of rising stars. Innovation is creating value on building cumulative advantage in the fabric and home care sector. Our breakthrough of proprietary three chamber unit, those laundry technology launched as Tide Pods, Ariel Pods and Gain Flings has reset that the life of consumer usage experience, product performance and convenience store. Unit-dose detergents are currently available in over 20 markets around the world, and have generated well over $1 billion in retail sales. The recent launch, Gain Flings is going extremely well, reaching nearly a 3% value share in the U.S. laundry category in just two months. Unit-dose now represents 11% of category sales of which we have an 80% share. The balance of the fabric care innovation bundle that we launched in North America in February is also off to a good start. And so, our execution of Tide Simply Clean and Fresh has gone very well. Total pricing share was up more than half a point over the past three-month period, an indication that so far Tide Simply Clean and Fresh is attracting incremental users to the brand. Improved scents and new sizes of Downy Unstoppables and Gain Fireworks in Wash Scent Beads have helped accelerate growth in this new product segment. The broad range of baby care innovations launched in the U.S., last fall, continue to deliver excellent results. Nearly every diaper across all sizes and price tiers was improved to deliver better absorbency, comfort or design. Overall, P&G U.S. baby care share was up two points with share growing in 90% of retail customer. This has led to our largest market share in the past 20 years, enabling us to retake market leadership from Kimberly-Clark. The extension of the Swagger's form in the sizes four and five has been particularly successful. Swagger share is up three points to a 10% value share of the U.S. diaper category. At the CAGNY conference in February, we announced we will be launching two new innovations in blades and razors. The first was the launch of Gillette BODY, which is moving well. The second and more significant innovation will be announced next Tuesday, April 29th. Men have told us they prefer the new innovation two to one versus the best selling razor in the world. More information will be coming to you soon on how you can watch the unveiling of our newest male shaving system. Product innovations like the one I've just described at laundry, baby care and grooming are critical to drive in strong sustainable top line momentum and delivering superior consumer value. We're also working to improve execution and operating discipline. We're seeing this improvement play out in the supply chain, in the execution of innovation launches in stores, and then the effectiveness and efficiency of our marketing programs. We are performing better, but there is still more to do. Operating discipline and execution have always been and must continue to be a core capability for Procter & Gamble. We believe that the focus we are bringing to these four areas; operating TSR, productivity, innovation, operational excellence, along with targeted reinvestment will enable us to continue to improve results even as it work to address several remaining opportunities. We remain on track to deliver our 2014 guidance, top line, bottom line and cash. We're maintaining organic sales growth range of 3% to 4%. Foreign exchange is expected to be a sales growth headwind of two to three points, which leads to all-in sales growth of approximately 1% for the fiscal year. We're maintaining our forecast for bottom line core earnings per share growth of 3% to 5%, offsetting stronger headwinds from foreign exchange and softer market growth rates with productivity savings. We currently expect foreign exchange to be roughly nine point headwind to core earnings per share growth. As a result, our guidance translates to constant currency core earnings per share growth in the range of 12% to 14%. Recall that with the planned sale of the pet care business, we are restating pet care earnings from continuing operations to discontinued operations. This will reduce core earnings per share by approximately $0.03 and $0.04 per share for fiscal years 2013 and 2014 respectively. All-in earnings per share growth remain the same. We have included a table in the press release this morning, which provides an estimate of the quarterly restatements. Please pay attention to this when you adjust your models as the impacts vary across quarters. On an all-in GAAP basis we now expect earnings per share to grow approximately 1% to 4%. This range reflects the non-core impacts from foreign exchange policy changes in Venezuela, approximately $0.15 of non-core restructuring cost in fiscal year 2014, and the restatement of pet care earnings into discontinued operations on both the current and prior fiscal years. The fourth quarter earnings growth that's implied within our guidance is driven by a combination of operating growth, driven by productivity savings and devaluation-related pricing, a low tax rate of about 21% on core earnings and $0.03 to $0.04 of small brand divestiture gains. We expect to deliver another year of about 90% free cash flow productivity. Our plans assume capital spending in the range of 4% to 5% of sales and share repurchase of about $6 billion. This comes to the assumptions included in our guidance; we want to continue to be very transparent about some key items that are not included. The guidance that we're confirming today is based on last week's FX spot rates. Further currency weakness is not anticipated within our guidance range. We continue to monitor and invest on several markets, the Middle East for example, and Ukraine, Venezuela and price controls access to dollars for imported products and devaluation present risks as do import restrictions and price controls in Argentina. Finally, our guidance assumes no further degradation in market growth rates. Our year-to-date results are in line with what we expect to deliver, putting us on track to deliver our goals for the fiscal year and make progress towards our long-term objectives. We continue to operate in a volatile environment with uncertainty in foreign exchange, deceleration in market growth rates and a rapidly developing policy environment. Against this backdrop, we have maintained a top line growth, and improved constant currency operating earnings growth. We launched a strong round of innovation in the third quarter and have significant new innovation coming in the fourth quarter, which will be complemented by further savings from productivity. We're making targeted investments in our core business, most promising and developing markets and biggest innovation opportunities, and are aggressively driving productivity and cost savings. Above all, we remain focused on value creation for consumers and for our shareholders. That concludes our prepared remarks. As a reminder, business segment information is provided in our press release and will be available in slides which will be posted in our website www.pg.com following the call. I'll be happy now to take any questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of John Faucher with JPMorgan. Please proceed. John Faucher \u2013 JPMorgan: Yes. Thank you, good morning. Jon, as we look at the cost savings, particularly on the gross margin line, they're not really flowing through at this point. Obviously some of that is the big transactional impact, but you have also got this very big mix impact, which is really offsetting a lot of the work you're doing there. How should we think about that over the next couple of years? And is this going to continue to be a massive drag? Or is it -- should it dissipate as you get more local manufacturing in place? And just give us a little bit of an update there. Thanks. Jon Moeller : So, there are two things as you rightly pointed, John, and as we talked about in prepared remarks that are offsetting the cost savings on the gross margin line, and one is FX, which is significant. Hopefully that annualizes, and as I mentioned we're committed to price we are legally allowed to help mitigate that effect as well. So, hopefully that portion of the dynamic dampens going forward. The other dynamic as you rightly point out is a mix dynamic, which has two components. One is -- two primary components. One is the category component. In the quarter, we just completed -- we had a great quarter of growth, both volume and sales in our home care segment, which is very profitable overall, but which does have lower gross margins than the balance of the business. By contrast, we had relatively soft quarters in our healthcare business and our grooming business, which are higher gross margin. I look at that as one quarter's impact. I don't think that sustains itself going forward. Some quarters, it will be positive; some quarters, it will be negative. The second component of that is the geographic component made up as you all know by faster growth in developing markets, which have lower gross margin. That impact will continue to exist. I don't see a scenario in the near-term where developed markets grow faster than developing markets. We will make progress on the margin in developing markets as manufacturing is localized as we build scale, but it's going to continue to be a component of drag. Do I think we can get to a place where this mix dynamic is only partially offsetting cost saving such that we're growing gross margin? Absolutely, and I expect that absent -- other big foreign exchange event, that would characterize the future. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Dara Mohsenian \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Hey, good morning. Jon Moeller : Good morning, Dara. Dara Mohsenian \u2013 Morgan Stanley : I was hoping you could discuss the sustainability of the gap between organic sales growth of 3% or 4% this year, and the local FX, core EPS growth of 12% to 14% particularly with a negative geographic gross margin mix impact. Do you think that gap is sustainable as you look out the next year in longer term? Then, just on a related note, I know you are not going to obviously give guidance on EPS next year, but given as a company that's in difficulty hitting the initial EPS targets over the last few years, I'm just wondering if conceptually there might be more of a need to bake in some conservatism as you set guidance going forward, particularly given the royalty, it's more volatile and obviously there had been a lot of external issues that have pressured results and could going forward, and if that's part of your thought process as you look to next year's guidance? Jon Moeller : Thanks, Dara. In terms of the spread between organic sales growth and constant currency earnings per share growth, for successful in delivering basically the $2 billion of savings per year that are implied in our $10 billion five year goal; that by itself is 11 points of earnings per share benefit. You add that to 3% to 4% organic sales growth and you're in the ballpark of the spread that we are talking about for this fiscal year. We have no intention of letting up our cost savings and productivity efforts and see several years of significant savings ahead of us. So, I think that relationship is representative of the work that's going on. How much of it actually gets to the all-in bottom line numbers will be a function of FX, and also a function of some degree of reinvestment is good, opportunities present themselves. In terms of philosophy on guidance, obviously we haven't spent a lot of time focusing on next year yet, but in general what we are going to try to continue to do is be incredibly transparent or as transparent as we can. If you look at the year that we just went through, the one reduction in guidance we made midway through the year was due to currency in Venezuela. The way we handled that in the initial forecast of the year was by communicating that we didn't have anything assumed in the numbers. We didn't know when or what the devaluation was going to be. We wanted to provide full transparency, so that you and other could in essence use your own understanding and knowledge to come to a form point of view what you thought the result was going to be. At minimum, we will continue to be very transparent, tell you what's in, tell you what's not in, and generally we like making our goals. We don't like not making them, and that will be reflected in our approach as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citi Research. Please proceed. Wendy Nicholson \u2013 Citi Research : Hi. Could you talk a little bit more about the comment that marketing efficiencies helped sort of generate all that SG&A leverage? How much of that was a shift from advertising to promotion? How much of that is just part of AGs long-term, \"Hey, we want to lower advertising by 100 basis points?\" Is there a risk that in some of these categories given how competitive the market is; is there a risk you are underinvesting or maybe just comment on all of that. Thanks. Jon Moeller : Sure, Wendy. So, the SG&A offset to gross margin, which resulted in operating margin accretion is driven by both overhead productivity and marketing effectiveness and efficiency improvements. Within marketing effectiveness and efficiency, a significant portion of that is a reduction in non-working dollars, tighter operations, if you will, and the design and creation of marketing programs. And another big portion of it is the work I mentioned to get to more effectively target consumers through new capabilities that are available to use new forms of media and consumer engagement to generate more effective communication, as well as more efficient communication with our targeted consumers. So, it's really all of that. As I tried to say in the prepared remarks, we are very focused on assuring that the overall impact of our advertising program, the number of consumers that we are reaching, the quality of that interaction grows, does not decline. I think there is -- we are at a point where simply looking at dollars, it's just not representative of the strength of a marketing program in a rapidly changing marketing landscape. We do -- to your question of underinvesting; that is something that we look at very carefully. There have been some categories this year, where we have reduced spending as the years going on, and there have been some categories where we have increased spending as the year going on. We are not going to underinvest, but we are going to be effective and efficient in our investment. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. Bill Schmitz \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Great, thank you. Good morning, everybody. So, a couple of questions; first one is, can you just break down the growth in emerging markets versus developed markets? And then I know we really talked about it, but can you talk a little bit about family care, because I think they are like your second and third largest businesses in the U.S., and clearly that slowed quite a bit. I know you cited some competitive promotional activity, but maybe yelling for that business and kind of how you respond to it, because it is obviously a decent chunk of the U.S. business. Thanks. Jon Moeller : First of all, the breakdown between developing and developed; developing in the quarter was plus five, developed was plus one. We are in here with a total of plus three. In terms of family care, you rightly pointed to the issue, Bill, which is a -- which heightens competitive activity reflected in the amount of promotion that's going on in the category, primarily driven by Georgia-Pacific. I'm not at liberty to talk about future actions that we might take, but I'll assure you that that's a category that we intent to be competitive in and will be. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo. Please proceed. Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo : Hi, thanks. So, just first real quick, Jon, I think you mentioned that there were gains coming in the fourth quarter -- you said three to four points. I just wanted to confirm that, but the real question is, look, obviously you face a ton of headwinds this year. And when you talk about productivity, you guys are using a term pull forward savings, right? You brought fiscal '13 savings into '14. You are almost at your 16 to 22 target on non-manufacturing roles. Can you talk about what that leads for '15? What do you need to sustain that pace of productivity? You need some of the supply chain stuff to start to come through? Or do you still see incremental runway from the sort of blocking and tackling savings that you are doing already? Thanks. Jon Moeller : So, first on the small brand divestiture gains in the fourth quarter, those should be between $0.03 and $0.04. Those are things we've talked about before; which is primarily the closure on the bleach sale, which we announced at CAGNY. That isn't a certain event we are going to have to wait to see how the regulators proceed. I think it is a certain event in terms if it's eventually happening, but the timing that is uncertain, but that's what's assumed in those numbers that I gave you. In terms of productivity going forward, as I mentioned, I see -- we see several more years of significant productivity opportunity. I wouldn't take the acceleration of savings into last year, or this year as an indication of reduced savings potential next year or the following year. And I can assure you that as our leadership team discusses this topic, that's not the mindset that we have. So, I would expect similar levels of savings for the foreseeable future. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Please proceed. Olivia Tong \u2013 Bank of America : Great, thank you. I appreciate it. First, is it possible to parse out the impact of mix from a country perspective versus a category perspective considering that you think that the country will continue to be in a case of developing (indiscernible) developed versus the category which may flow overtime? Then, can you also update us on the percentage on market share that you are holding or gaining in overall also for the U.S? Thanks. Jon Moeller : In terms of the components of mix, it's about half-and-half, Olivia, between the two drivers that you cited, and of course that varies quarter-on-quarter, but think of it as roughly 50-50. And then, yeah, the market share question, sorry. We are about flat on the quarter, the market is growing about 3% and that dynamic is true and our aggregate basis both globally and in the U.S. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed. Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets : Yeah, thank you very much. Just a quick clarification, Jon, the organization design changes that you talked about, is that a function and output of what Jorge Uribe was working on, and if there is any more work to do in that area? And then, the actual bigger picture question is, can you just give us an update on the OTC business? And it seems like a scalable business where P&G can win with their brands. Any appetite for M&A I know there is a lot of assets out there that potentially could kind of get unlocked for purchase. So, I just wanted to get a philosophical viewpoint on that. Thank you. Jon Moeller : Sure, Nik. First, as it relates to organization design, some of the changes that I talked about are very much a product of the work that Jorge Uribe and others have been leading. Most of it is just been put in place now or in the summer. And I fully expect that as that happens, not only our operations going to improve as we reduce duplication and increase clarity of accountability, but I expect that we will identify additional opportunities from those new ways of operating. That's very much what we saw when we set up the sector organizations a year ago. We had an estimate for savings that could be possible, but as we got into it, it became clear that there were additional savings possible. This is again something we are going to keep grind in way at day-after-day, week-after-week, and create an organization that's not only more efficient, but is more effective that has a broader range of job responsibilities and is a funner, easier place to work. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Please proceed. Ali Dibadj \u2013 Bernstein: Hi, guys. Do you want to go back to pick a few things; one is on the negative 75 basis points roughly of the mixed element on gross margin that should dissipate? Can you give us a sense of kind of over what timeframe you think that will happen, given all the investments you are making to grow the categories, but also frankly on a geographic piece as well I think your plans etcetera like the one in Brazil? The second thing is, you mentioned on the release in the beauty section, the sales declines in salon and skin care, primarily in Asia. So, that mean you are getting better skin care stability in the U.S. And then, the last question is want to understand better the grooming negative 4% mix that we saw in the quarter. Thanks. Jon Moeller : Okay, let me first -- I apologize, Nik, I breezed by the second part of your question. Let me go back to that first, and then come back to you and if I continue my trend this morning forgetting the second part of the question, you can remind me what they were. Nik, in terms of OTC, it is a space that we like, and certainly demographically advantaged, it's an area that we feel we have strength in within select product treatment areas. As we have said for several years, it is a place that we would consider adding to our business both organically. Clearly, the Teva joint venture has enabled us to accelerate our progress internationally quite significantly. We added the new chapter asset recently. So, it is a space that we will continue to look for opportunities in, but we are also going to be choiceful and value-driven as we pursue and evaluate those opportunities. Only on the glide paths for mix, the developing/developed split is so much informed by foreign exchange. I mean, there is a constant FX cost differential. I'd say that's -- I think we have talked before probably a three to five year glide path, it's not overnight, but we will get there just as we have in China, just as we have in Russia, just as we have in Saudi and places that we have been operating for longer periods of time. How much of that actually gets to the bottom line is going to be a function of FX, which is why I hesitate to say definitely it's going to be X period of time. The second piece on skin care, we had a reasonably good quarter on both U.S. skin care, which was up mid single-digits, and on U.S. Pantene, which was also up mid single-digits. We continue to have opportunity in Asia. I wouldn't say that we have necessarily fully rounded the corner on either U.S. skin care or U.S. Pantene, but certainly are making a significant progress. Then on Gillette mix, large part of that is geographic as you're probably well aware. We have some category growth challenges in the U.S., so the size of that market is down, and that's the most profitable piece of the business. That's something as category leaders were responsible for managing and we are actively doing that. We certainly like the position that we start from in that task. We have 70% of market share, the most profitable segment, huge levels of consumer loyalty, very high, especially relative to other participants in the category, net promoter scores. We offer really a significant value to consumers. A man can use Gillette Fusion ProGlide for a cost of about $1 a week. For that he gets uncompromised quality from a brand that spanned over a century developing the best shaving products for men. We have significant innovation coming to market in the shave care space as well, which should help both market growth and mix going forward. We have launched the body product that we talked about at CAGNY. On the 29th of April, we will be revealing the next major innovation for Gillette, and well, I can't give details of that today. All of that will be revealed on the 29th. What I can tell you -- what man are telling us, which is that they prefer this product two to one versus the world's best selling razor currently. So, we are active in terms of managing the category challenge in the U.S. and are excited about some of the innovation that we are bringing the bearer to do that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Stieb with Credit Suisse. Please proceed. Michael Stieb \u2013 Credit Suisse : Good morning, Jon. You mentioned earlier that emerging markets growth I think in the quarter was 5% if I understood that correctly. From memory, I think it was 8% in the last quarter. Could you just tell us where you are seeing most of that -- majority of that slowdown, please? And then on that note, could you also provide us an update on the growth that you are seeing in China, please? Jon Moeller : Well, China continues to be a very attractive market. We have grown that business 50% over the last three years. And quarter-to-quarter there can be some chop, but it continues to be a very attractive market for us. Market growth in general in developing markets has slowed by one to two points over the last six months, and that's what explains most of the slowdown that I mentioned in our developing market business. Fiscal year-to-date were high singles, call it 7%. So, the 5% is two points lower than that. If you look at share as a measure of whether we are holding or losing ground, we built share in Brazil by more than half a point. We have built share value there for 22 consecutive quarters. We build share in India, where we have grown double-digits now for 47 consecutive quarters. We built a modest amount of share in Russia. China; frankly is very hard to read shares at the moment. There is a significant channelship that's occurring, for instance, to e-commerce where we are doing very well on share point, but which Nielsen doesn't measure. We have wholesalers that are shifting from Nielsen measured retailers as their source of volume to non- Nielsen measured distributors. It's a bit complex, but again, it's a business we feel good about. We have got good innovation coming to market there. We just launched a premium diaper which in its early days has done extremely well taking market leadership in three out of the four, major e-commerce platform is for diapers in China in its early entry period. So, as I said in our prepared remarks, I expect developing markets will continue to be a disproportionate source of growth across the board for many years to come. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Jason English - Goldman Sachs : Hi, good morning, folks. Thanks for the question. Two questions, first, a small housekeeping item. Can you give us a sense of what sort of gains you expect on the pet care business once it's sold, just as we think about modeling into next year? Then, back to my other question, I want to go back to the organizational changes that you talked about in prepared remarks and a little bit in Q&A. I get the cost efficiency benefit of reducing role redundancy and merging countries into fewer SMO clusters, but I was hoping you could help me on your agility comment. How does further centralization and decision making in an already heavily centralized organization make you more agile? As you move forward with this, how do you ensure that local execution doesn't falter? Thanks. Jon Moeller : Good question. First relative to the gains, I think if we go back to the press release we issued moving out to the sale, we said we expected very little impact, positive or negative from a one-time gain standpoint from the sale of the pet business. John, can give you more specifics there later today, but generally it shouldn't be a major impact. In terms of the organization question, I think there is couple of things that we can do a better job explaining. One is that there seems to be a notion that when we talk about global business units, that by definition moving work into global business units centralizes that work and moves it to a global level. I understand completely why one would have that conclusion, because when we describe it that's just what it sounds like, but that's not what happens. So, we have GBU resources at a global level, at a regional level, at a local level. We have brand managers at a global level, at a regional level, at a local level for each of our major product lineups. So, what we are trying to do is just clarify that the work of brand building belongs with those people, locally, regionally and globally. It shouldn't be done by other organizations in addition to those resources. We need those resources focusing on one of the most strategic things we do, which is sell and build joint value creation with our customers. And you can imagine if you have two different organizations working on the same thing, from an internal standpoint how that can create a lot of complexity, if you're in an executional role in the organization, it's hard to know what to execute when you're getting multiple sources of direction. And so, clarifying this, de-duplicating it, should have both, I think, cost, opportunity associated with it, as well as enabling us to be more agile, be clear, be more decisive, be quicker in terms of the action that we take. And to-date, over the last roughly two years, we reduced the number of overhead roles by 8,000 people. We've done that without significant business disruption, without significant organization disruption. It doesn't mean it's all done easy, but it gives us confidence that we can continue to improve here without being overly concerned about business disruption. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with UBS. Please proceed. Steve Powers - UBS: Hi, Jon. Good morning. Regarding your North American and potential western European supply chain restructuring programs, do you have any estimates for the costs, whether cash or non-cash associated with those programs in the 200 million to 300 million savings you mentioned? I guess how should we be expecting the flow over the three to four year life of the program? Will there be non-core charges, elevated CapEx; will it show up another area, etcetera? That's my main question. Then just if I can tag on one more, which is related to taxes, I think the quarter and your guidance for next quarter imply kind of a tax rate for the year in the 21% to 22% range, if my math is right, I just wanted to get your update on whether you think that rate is sustainable going forward and what the risks are in either direction to sort of the more normalized tax rate as we look ahead? Thanks. Jon Moeller : On supply chain, there will be costs, there will be capital; those will be significant, so obviously we wouldn't do this if we weren't running a significant return on those. We'll try to detail those for you at some level when we provide guidance for next year. As I mentioned earlier, we are still working through ordinary exploratory process of this in Europe. We would like to come to you with total package, which we will do as we provide our guidance for the year. Within that though capital spending I don't see going -- I see it's staying in kind of 4% to 5% range as we execute this program. We'll continue working very had on working capital reduction as an offset to this. We've been able to do that successfully over the last three or four years with our whole build out program in developing markets, really maintaining our free cash flow productivity targets despite somewhat higher capital spending, and that's certainly the objective going forward. So, I wouldn't consider it net of major change to the cash profile of the company. There will be some cost to execute it. Some of those will be non-core, some of those will be core, and we will provide more contexts with guidance. Tax rates on the year, based on everything we know today should be 21%. We saw it a quarter ago. So that can change, but that's what we're seeing currently. This is going to continue to be a bit lumpy as we go forward. You're going to see quarters, where it's going to be lower that, you're going to see quarters, where it's going to be higher than. And that's a function of geographic mix, as you can appreciate. It's also a function of the timing of audits and reserve establishments and reserve reversals etcetera. We'd try to provide disclosure on the big chunks of that within our financial disclosures in our statements. In terms of what can -- what are the major drivers that could affect tax rate going forward, clearly, again geographic mix can affect it. That should be generally a net positive as we go growth, assuming that developing markets continue to grow faster than developed markets, and there are lower tax rates in developing markets. The other change of course that is unknowable and can affect us either positively or negatively is our policy developments, both in the U.S. and overseas. Well, to say those in general, there seems to be a lot of competitiveness on the part of governments to maintain business-friendly status in a slower growing economy. So, I think it would be somewhat unlikely that there would be a major adverse event that would affect our tax rate significantly, but of course that's completely unknowable. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed. Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets : Good morning. I just had a question for clarification on the supply chain savings. I think you were talking about $200 million a year, could you say if that is only for North America, and when you'd expect it to start? Jon Moeller : The 200 million to $300 million range I gave you, which is a very off-range at this point, is inclusive of our early thinking on Europe. So, it's North America and Europe. We will start seeing some of those savings next year, particularly the distribution-related savings, as we consolidate distribution and customization centers into fewer distribution centers located closer to customers. That's a relatively smaller portion of the overall savings, which will accrue the major savings will start accruing in three and four years from now. So, it's something that -- we're changing our footprint so dramatically that we want to do it in a very disciplined, organized way to avoid business disruption. The savings will be significant, but they will be -- they are not immediate. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research. Please proceed. Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I will like to come back to the emerging market negative mix issue, and basically if you can help us, Jon, kind of like at least have an average emerging market gross margin and operating margin figure? And also, more philosophically, you have over $30 billion in sales in emerging markets, which is much -- these are much bigger than most your competitors combine, and essentially you have lower profitability, and then the question is, is it because you're leading with long categories, leading with categories that have low margins as opposed to leading with categories like beauty or healthcare, and essentially you're doubling down in the negative mix by leading with the legacy businesses, which is detergent and some paper as opposed to the high margin businesses, beauty, healthcare and grooming? Thank you. Jon Moeller : Thanks, Javier. We'll give you some better gross and operating margin breakdown relative to company average for developing markets as part of our guidance for next year. The reason I'm not giving that to you right now is because it's all changing as we put in pricing for FX etcetera. And I'd like to get to a more stable situation, so I can give you something that's actually useful, but I understand the need and we can provide something that hopefully will help there. In terms of our developing market business profitability, it's really a tale of two cities, in markets where we have been for extended periods of time, where we've developed the scale to justify localization of the supply chain, where we've built local organizations, and where we've developed significant relationships with our retail partners, we have very good margins; in many cases, at the company average, and in some cases, above the company average. So I mentioned markets before, like Russia, like China, like Saudi; there are number of examples. And take China as an example, that's not only our second largest market in terms of sales, it's our second largest market in terms of profit. So, obviously it's a very profitable situation there. And I think that is more what needs to occur than altering the mix of product categories in the markets where we're earlier on in our journey, like Brazil and like India. We need to get the cost structure. We need to get consumer usage of premium products, which is happening -- it happened in China, it clearly happened in Russia; it's happening right now in Brazil, a little bit less so in India. Those are the things that will enable us to get margins to a place that I'm very confident that we'll get to, which is somewhere close to -- little bit below the company average. Your point though on other categories is an important one. I mentioned earlier that we are really through the joint venture with Teva for the first time, building out our healthcare business, which is very high margin across the globe, including developing markets. We've talked before about the less expansion in Russia and Eastern Europe. We have some things going on in Latin America. And so, we will continue to where there are smart value-creating opportunities, expand not just the paper and detergent businesses, but also the beauty and healthcare businesses. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello with Oppenheimer. Please proceed. Joe Altobello - Oppenheimer: Thanks. Good morning. Jon. I guess first question is in terms of the innovation strategy and how you're seeing it right now? Given that we've seen you go down market recently with Tide, also up market, it sounds like in blade razors, well, the emphasis still be on moving up market going forward and staying true to what has been a very successful trade-up strategy for you guys? Or given the environment, do you think the innovation going forward will be a little more balance between mid-tier and premium price points? And then secondly, in terms of the outlook for next year, I know it's very early, so I'm not going to ask for guidance here, but given that you're going to be anniversarying the FX headwinds and given that the manufacturing startup costs are behind you, what do you see as the biggest headwinds of you guys in fiscal '15? Thanks. Jon Moeller : In terms of innovation, we'll continue to pursue a balanced innovation strategy. If you just think about the laundry bundle in North America now, it has lower priced components, deigned for consumers for whom prices are a biggest part of their personal value equation, it also has premium items. We generated more new sales on Gain Flings than we did on Tide Simply Clean and Fresh in the last quarter. And innovation decisions are going to be guided by consumers, their needs and wants. It's less about price point, and it is about value for a particular consumer. Value, as you know is a combination of pricing and product efficacy, consumer experience, our communication of that experience etcetera. So, we are going to continue to be focused on consumers with whom we can create value and to whom we can provide value. Relative to headwinds going forward, I think one of the biggest headwinds is market growth, both in developing and developed markets. The good news is we have a say in that, and we can create growth with innovation by trading in consumers, in many markets, trading consumers up in other markets, but that is -- it's challenging in a 3% growth world, and that's just the reality that we're going to have to adapt to. It is part and parcel of the combined productivity and innovation strategy. Those are the two things that are required to win in a slower growth environment. And the two things were committed to deliver. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Please proceed. Bill Chappell - SunTrust: Thanks for the question. I just want to go back to divestiture of the pet business, and I think we will go back few years when the divestiture of the coffee business, the plan was to take the proceeds and reinvest in actually restructuring and try to offset some of the dilution. And this divestiture, there is just for general corporate purposes. So, just trying to understand at what point, 2.9 million, 5 billion, I mean is there a philosophy change in terms of maybe reinvesting some of this money back into the business or reinvesting it to share repurchases or kind of a thought, because this doesn't seem to be one of the smaller divestitures you've done over the past few years? Jon Moeller : A couple of things here; first of all, the 2.9 billion becomes 2 billion once we pay Uncle Sam. So that's the amount of cash that we're looking at this point. And really that cash that we'll earn next fiscal year, when the deal is likely to close; buyers have a nasty habit of not paying new until they have certainty on ownership of the asset. And so, we'll build that cash into our planning for next fiscal year, and we will be very clear with you how we're intending to use that. Relative to the Folgers situation, there are two things that are different with regard to restructuring. The first is that Folgers was much more dilutive than pet is going to be, and so the need was greater from that standpoint. Second, at the time that we announced Folgers, we didn't have a non-core restructuring program. And so, we chose to increase restructuring to accommodate that objective. We have a fairly robust restructuring program right now. We're not capped or limited. If there is more opportunity to generate return and create value by all means, we will. But again, this is a next year cash flow, and we will get back to you with the use of that cash as we describe plans for next fiscal year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alice Longley with Buckingham Research. Please proceed. Alice Longley - Buckingham Research : Hi, good morning. I have just a couple leftover housekeeping questions. You're 1% organic growth in the developed regions; can you break that out in terms of volume price and mix? And my other question is when you give us your EPS growth adjusted for currency, could you explain what you take out to get to that number? Do you take out the pricing that you're getting in emerging regions? Is there an offset to currency? Do you take out all the cost benefits, the local cost benefits you're getting as the result of currency as well? Thank you. Jon Moeller : Developed market organic sales breakdown, we had 2% volume growth in developed markets, a minus 1 point price mix dynamic getting you to 1% organic sales growth. So that's the breakdown there. The currency numbers do not include pricing. They do include the total transaction impact on the cost structure. So, if there are local cost benefits that's in the currency number. We just take our currency exposures on the rate of change, and that's the number we're providing. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Please proceed. Mark Astrachan - Stifel: Yeah. Thanks, and good morning. I wanted to clarify a couple of things on the North America beauty business. Was there any benefit from restocking from destocking, a year ago, six months ago? And then, from the slowdown in developing markets, any commentary there about whether the categories or a category-specific has become more promotional as a result of the slowdown? Jon Moeller : I think the beauty organic sales numbers are representative of the state of the business. I don't think they include any one-time, significant one-time impacts of any sort. So I think you should look at them as decent numbers. Relative to promotion levels, we're seeing increased promotion in North America in a few categories. We talked earlier about the family care category, where we have some increased promotion. We've seen increased promotion not surprisingly in response to our laundry innovation launches in North America. And we've seen increased promotion relative to -- in response to our innovation in the hair care space. But we look at those generally as temporary in nature, and it's not -- as I've said many time before, promotion is not high on our list of strategic choices to grow business, so it's certainly not a dynamic that we're going to be encouraging. If you look at price mix, inclusive of promotion, for the last quarter it was a positive impact on a global basis. It's been a neutral or positive impact for 13 consecutive quarters. It's been a positive impact for the last nine years. So, we're going to try to compete on the basis of innovation, make sure the base price of our product is as sharp as it can be as a result of our productivity efforts. We'll need to be competitive on promotion levels, but it's not (indiscernible) that we're going to drive. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jon Andersen with William Blair. Please proceed. Jon Andersen - William Blair : Yeah. Good morning, Jon. You mentioned a significant shift to e-commerce in I think referring to China that you're seeing, but I guess, I suspect you are seeing a similar shift in perhaps developed markets as well. Should we think about this as a net positive for P&G manufacturers in terms of reach your ability to target consumers, even profitability? And if you could just discuss maybe that opportunity and any plans you have to capitalize on that channel shift over time? Jon Moeller : We want to be available for consumers wherever they want to shop, and that includes the e-commerce space. Jon, you mentioned some very attractive aspects of that space. One is the ability to target -- to more narrowly target consumers, more effectively target consumers, and that's certainly relevant. There is also an opportunity to provide sometimes some more information as \"E\" in general becomes what we're calling the Zero Moment of Truth, and sometimes it's the zero and first moment of truth. In general, e-commerce shoppers represent a more attractive demographic. We're seeing larger basket sizes in some of the e-commerce channels than in bricks and mortar, not always, but in some cases. And we're working very hard to ensure that our share of both sales and profits is at least as good as the case and more traditional retail channels. And that currently is the case. But this is a channel that's been evolving fast, and we'll continue to change significantly in the next three to five years and it's something that we need to do and intend to be a significant part of. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Caroline Levy with CLSA. Please proceed. Caroline Levy - CLSA: Good morning, Jon. It's on margins, I'm just looking at the EBIT margin expansion in beauty and grooming, and I'm wondering if going forward you believe you will be able to sustain that, or if you actually see some pickup in margins in any other divisions? Jon Moeller : Well, I think sustaining 17% earnings growth, which is what you see in the beauty segment in the last quarter, is not an objective we would have. We're happy with that growth. We want over time to achieve more balance between that top line and bottom line. We're still delivering a very strong bottom line. And the bigger margin improvement opportunity I think comes as we do three things; 1) get the higher margin categories growing at their rate of category growth, and that includes beauty. 2) Improve our margins in developing markets as we've talked about with several of you this morning, and 3) is continue focusing on growth behind innovation in developed markets where we have higher margins. And that's -- all three are very much part of our thought process and activity system presently. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

Today\u2019s discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G\u2019s most recent 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from these projections. As required by Regulation G, P&G needs to make you aware that during the call, the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Management believes these measures provide investors valuable information on the underlying growth trends of the business. Organic refers to reported results, excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, where applicable. Free cash flow represents operating cash flow less capital expenditures. Free cash flow productivity is the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings. Any measure described as core refers to the equivalent GAAP measure, adjusted for certain items. P&G has posted on its website, www.pg.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP and other financial measures. Now, I will turn the call over to P&G\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller. Jon Moeller : Good morning. I am joined this morning by AG Lafley and John Chevalier. We will start our discussion with a review of fiscal year and fourth quarter results, AG will then discuss our going forward strategy and plans to strengthen our results, and I will close with guidance for fiscal 2015. One housekeeping item before we begin all the numbers we will be discussing today assume discontinued operations treatment for the pet care business, reflecting in our planned exit. Impacts of the move from operating results to discontinued operations were provided previously in an 8-K filing and are available online. Now, on to results, we grew organic sales 3% in the fiscal year we just completed in line with median performance in our industry. We essentially held market share. Core earnings per share increased 5%. Organic sales and earnings per share results were both within our target ranges. In fact, they were both within the pre-Venezuela devaluation ranges that we established going into the fiscal year despite more than a 25% reduction in market growth rates from 4 points a year ago to 2.5 points to 3 points currently and significant negative foreign exchange developments versus our going in plan. Our productivity program, which we will talk more about later, was a significant enabler in delivering in this outcome. On a constant currency basis, core earnings per share grew double-digits despite market growth headwinds. All-in sales grew 1%. All-in earnings per share grew 4%. We generated $10.1 billion of free cash flow with 86% free cash flow productivity. We increased the dividend 7%, the 58th consecutive year that the dividend has been increased. We have returned $12.9 billion in cash to shareholders, $6.9 billion in dividends, and $6 billion in share repurchase. About 110% of net earnings all-in. We made significant progress on productivity, operating discipline and execution. We delivered $1.6 billion of cost of goods savings, well ahead of our target run rate of $1.2 billion and ahead of our going in estimate of $1.4 billion. We improved manufacturing productivity by over 7%, reducing overall enrollment while adding new capacity and new sites. We opened the first new multi-category distribution center in the U.S. with five additional centers slated to come online by early next calendar year. We continued to accelerate overhead reduction. In February 2012 we announced the targeted 10% reduction of non-manufacturing enrollment by June of 2016. As of July 1, 2014, we have reduced roles by 16% more than 50% ahead of the original objective two years earlier. We have made good progress driving marketing effectiveness and efficiency through an optimized media mix with more digital, mobile, search and social presence, improved message clarity and greater savings in non-media spending. While acknowledging the progress I just described across cost of goods sold overhead and marketing you maybe asking yourselves, where have all the savings gone. In the year we just completed most went to offset FX. We have large leading positions in some of the markets where currencies have softened the most Japan, Venezuela and Ukraine and where our price controls are in place. Excluding foreign exchange core earning per share were up double digits. Partly as a result of devaluation we are seeing significant wage inflation in developing markets as much as 30% per annum, which we also need to offset. We are continuing to make targeted investments in innovation, trial generation and in selling coverage to drive growth. In addition to productivity, we made good progress this year in continuing to focus the portfolio. Just yesterday we closed the Americas pet care sales to Mars. Mars has also chosen to exercise their option to purchase the Asia business which accounts 10% of sales. We are working the European pet transaction with a different set of buyers. We exited concierge health services business and MDVIP. We exited the bleach business and we divested several additional smaller brands Latin America Pert as an example. Moving from the fiscal year to the fourth quarter organic sales grew 2% in a very challenging macro environment with decelerating levels of market growth in both developed and developing regions and intense competitive spending in several categories. Organic volume was in line with prior year levels, pricing added two points to sales growth. All-in, sales were down one point including the two point headwind from foreign exchange and a modest negative impact from minor brand divestitures. Core earnings per share were $0.95, a 20% increase versus the prior year. Foreign exchange was a $0.04 headwind on the quarter. Excluding foreign exchange, core earnings per share grew 25%. This includes the 5 point benefit from tax and a 4 point benefit from minor brand divestitures. Core operating margin improved 170 basis points driven by productivity savings. Core gross margin was down 50 basis points. Cost savings were approximately 270 basis points were offset by product category and geographic mix, foreign exchange and higher commodity costs. Core SG&A costs as a percentage of sales improved by 220 basis points, driven by overhead savings of 110 basis points, marketing efficiencies of 30 basis points and other SG&A reductions. As we previewed in the last call non-operating gains from minor brand and business divestitures added approximately $0.03 to core earnings per share on the quarter. The effective tax rate on core earnings was 19% bringing the fiscal year rate to 21%, consistent with the outlook we provided in the last call. June quarter all-in GAAP earnings per share were $0.89, which include approximately $0.04 per share of non-core restructuring charges and $0.02 of charges from legal reserve adjustments. In summary, we have just completed a challenging and tough but on-target year. We met our objectives, delivered double digit constant currency earnings growth, meaningfully advanced our productivity and portfolio focus agendas and built on our strong track record of cash return to shareholders. There is more work to do to deliver sustainable sales growth and reliable profit cash and value creation. I will turn it over to AG to talk about strategies and plans to accomplish this. AG Lafley : Thanks Jon. So that we are crystal clear, as John reported we delivered our business and financial commitments in 2013-2014, but we could have and should have done better. If just a couple of businesses that missed their going in operating plans had delivered, we would have achieved our internal leadership team goals of 4% sales growth, built modest market share, delivered 7% core EPS instead of 5% and 5% core operating profit growth instead of 2%. Despite all the market realities Jon described, country volatility, market slowdowns, currency hurts, customer and competitor challenges, the point here is delivering a better year was solely in our influence and control. So, while operating discipline and executional capability is getting better, a lot better around here, it must continue to improve to reach the levels of performance this company and our organization is capable of. We are increasing our focus on shoppers and consumers, they are the boss. Everything begins with consumer understanding winning the zero first and second moments of truth and everything ends with winning the consumer value equation, consumer preference, purchase and loyalty. We are focused on creating and building consumer preferred brands and products that generate leading industry growth and value creation. This is how we will generate top tier total shareholder return. We need to continue to strengthen our brand positions, our product portfolio and pipeline and our selling effectiveness in the country\u2019s channels and customers in a way that maximizes shopper trial and regular purchase, drives brand and category growth and delivers more reliable value creation for customers, partners for P&G and of course for shareowners. Today, we are announcing an important strategic step forward that will significantly streamline and simplify the company\u2019s business and brand portfolio. We will become a much more focused, much more streamlined company of 70 to 80 brands organized into about a dozen business units and the four focused industry sectors. We will compete in categories that are structurally attractive and that play to P&G strength. Within these categories, we will focus on leading brands marketed in the right countries, channels and customers, where the size of the prize and the probability of winning are highest with product lines and SKUs that really matter to shoppers and customers. Why this significant strategic where to play change in brand portfolio? These core 70 to 80 brands are consumer preferred and customer supported. These brands are for the most part leaders in their industry category or segment, 23 with sales of $1 billion to $10 billion, another 14 with sales of $0.5 billion to $1 billion, and the remainder 30 to 40 with strong brand equities in sales of $100 million to $500 million. These brands are all well positioned with consumers and customers and well-positioned competitively. These brands have strong equities in differentiated products and a track record of growth and value creation driven by product innovation and brand preference. These brands are core strategic and have very real potential to grow and deliver meaningful value creation. Over the last three years, the 70 to 80 brand portfolio has accounted for 90% of company sales and over 95% of profit. It has grown 1 point or 100 basis points faster than the total company and has earned more than 1 additional point of before tax margin. This new streamlined P&G should continue to grow faster and more sustainably and reliably create more value. Importantly, this will be a much simpler, much less complex company of leading brands that\u2019s easier to manage and operate. This simplicity will significantly focus investment and resource allocation and enable execution. We will harvest, partner, discontinue or divest the balance 90 to 100 brands. In aggregate, sales of these brands, has been declining 3% per year over the past three years. Profits have been declining 16%. These brands make up less than half the average company margin. The strategic narrowing and refocusing of the brand portfolio will have a number of significant benefits mutually reinforcing. 70 to 80 brands will bring clarity, focus and prioritization and simplicity to a smaller more integrated better coordinated organization. The brand business units will be responsible for brand and product programs end-to-end down to the local country level. Selling and market operations will be responsible for customer and channel strategies (Technical Difficulty). I will continue. Selling and market operations will be responsible for customer and channel strategies for distribution, shelving, merchandising and pricing execution for winning at the first moment of truth at the retail customer and distributor level. This focus on fewer core strategic brands will enable a strategic rationalization of product lines within brands and an even more significant pruning of unproductive SKUs. As we rationalized business and brand portfolios, product lines and SKUs, P&G brands and products will be easier to shop and more productive and profitable for our customers, our partners and for the company. This focus on fewer strategic brands will enable R&D to focus product and technology development on more consumer relevant and impactful brand and product ideas. We have already started reallocating R&D resources and budgets, cutting out low value activity and doubling down on our most promising product innovations. This focus on fewer core strategic brands will importantly inform our supply chain transformation. We will now match manufacturing capacity to the brand portfolio and product lines. We will build distribution and mixing centers for only the brands and products we choose to sell. This should enable industry leading responsiveness and service to customers at lower cost throughout the value chain. With this refocus on consumer and shopper preferred leading brands, we will be able to focus selling operations by retail, account, wholesaler and distributor, strategies, tactics and in-store executions that really make a difference. The same simplification and prioritization enables all our functions to provide the business units and sales operations better value-added help and support. In summary, we are going to create a faster growing more profitable company that is far simpler to manage and operate. This will enable P&G people to be more agile and responsive, more flexible and faster, less will be much more. As a result of the company\u2019s strategic focus on its leading brands, we will both accelerate and over-deliver the original $10 billion productivity plan. While we are not going to publish or report specific endpoint savings numbers today, we will clearly over-deliver the original goals and we will update you on progress along the way. In cost of goods sold, we are driving further and faster than when we established the original savings objectives. The annual manufacturing productivity improvements we are making and have made measured by the number of cases of product produced per person per year are well beyond initial targets that our process reliability and adherence to quality standards is resulting in less raw material and finished product scrapping. Increasing localization of supply chain is driving transportation and warehousing cost savings. Earlier this year, we initiated what is probably the biggest supply chain redesign in our company\u2019s history. We are moving from primarily single category production sites to fewer multi-category manufacturing plants. We are taking this opportunity to simplify, standardize and upgrade manufacturing platforms for faster innovation, qualification and expansion and improve product quality. We moved to standard manufacturing platforms a little over 10 years ago in baby care. We are developing standardized manufacturing platforms for a number of businesses, fabric care, grooming, oral, and personal power to name a handful. We are transforming our distribution center network moving from shipping products to customers from many ship points as if they were coming from different companies to consolidating customers shipping into fewer distribution centers. These centers are located strategically closer to customers and key population centers in North America enabling 80% of P&G\u2019s business to be within one day or less of the store shelf and the shopper. This will allow both P&G and our retail partners to optimize inventory levels, while still improving service and on-shelf availability, efficient customer and consumer response and more importantly reducing in-store out of stocks. All of our new distribution centers will be up and running by early 2015. To manage and operate the simpler brand portfolio, we have made several important organization design changes, move to four industry-based sectors, streamlined and de-duplicate \u2013 de-duplication of business units and selling operations, recombination of four brand building functions into one, reduction of hierarchy with all the sales operations and business unit leaders working together and working directly with Jon and with me. Each of these changes reduces complexity. Each creates clear accountability for performance and results. We are just beginning to benefit from these opportunities to improve performance and reduce overhead costs that the organization changes create. We believe we have more opportunity to improve marketing effectiveness and efficiency in both media or non-media areas, while increasing overall marketing effectiveness and improving top line growth. When we get brand and product innovation right, source and sell brands and products effectively and efficiently we grow and we drive meaningful value creation. We generate higher sales and profit per unit which enables us to capture greater share of the value profit and cash where we choose to compete. It is this share of value the share of profit and cash that is generated that we really want to focus on and if we can disproportionately capture. Today we have about 60 share of U.S. laundry market sales that earn approximately 85% of the profit and cash generated in the entire category, nearly a 70 share of grooming business worldwide and about a 90 share of value or profit. This disproportionate capture of category value is direct result and reflection of our business strategy and our business models. There has been some discussion in this context about whether premium price brands and products are still drivers of growth and value creation and I want to comment on this briefly this morning. We are shopper and consumer led. Their wants and needs come first. We meet those needs with differentiated brands and better performing products priced to deliver real and perceived consumer value. In all four industry sectors and in most of our businesses there is as much and often more sales growth and value creation profit and cash in the premium and super premium segments. We have had some success in these segments. In the grooming market premium products generate about 43% of category sales. Gillette has an 88 share of this segment. Four years ago we introduced Fusion ProGlide priced at the higher end of the premium segment. Fusion grew global value share for 31 consecutive quarters reaching $1 billion in sales, faster than any other P&G brand or any other Gillette shaving systems in history. Fusion has been successful in developing markets which accounts for 25% of the brand\u2019s and product line\u2019s total business. In countries where Fusion has been in the market for several years it has earned value shares that rival those is the best developed markets. South Korea we have a 45 share and Russia a 33 share for example. Last month we launched the newest product in the Fusion lineup FlexBall is the first razor designed to respond to the contours of a man\u2019s face maintaining maximum contact in delivering a close or more complete and more comfortable shave. End market go side - premarket men preferred FlexBall two to one versus the then best selling razor in the world our own Fusion ProGlide. FlexBall is off to a very good start and appears to be revitalizing consumer interest in the category. While it\u2019s only been available a couple of months we have seen a 30% spike in male razor category value in the U.S. and acceleration in cartridge sales and shares. Crest 3D White premium oral care regimen was also launched in the U.S. and grew market share for 17 consecutive quarters, expanded worldwide and has become $1 billion business. 3D White has been an important driver of toothpaste market share growth in Brazil and Mexico adding about 0.5 of share in Brazil and a point in Mexico. We have recently launched 3D White in Spain, France and Australia. Early results are encouraging with growth in both category and our market share. In Western Europe the oral care category grew 3.5% in value this last quarter in the region where many other categories are declining 1% to 2%. 3D White is a big driver of that category growth. Following up on the 3D White launch we introduced Crest 3D White Luxe toothpaste and White Strips. The toothpaste removes up to 90% of surface stains on teeth in just five days and protects against future stains with a proprietary technology. The Whitestrips with FlexFit stretch and mold to your teeth for a custom fit. Tide, Gain, and Ariel unit does laundry detergents have been an innovation breakthrough, resetting the bar for delightful consumer usage experience, product performance and convenience in the laundry detergent category. Tide Pods have priced at a 20% premium to base Liquid Tide and had grown to over 7% of the laundry category. In March, we launched Gain Flings, their version of Pods, priced at a 60% per use premium to Gain liquid detergent. Flings have already grown to nearly 3% value share, combined Tide Pods and Gain Flings now hold a more than 10 value share of the U.S. laundry category and over 80% of the unit dose segment. We now offer this innovative product in over 50 countries. And several other markets including Japan and China, we\u2019ve recently launched single chamber unit does product setting the stage for future upgrades as the unit dose segment develops. In Japan, Ariel and Bold unit dose detergents are off to a strong start achieving a nine value share in just three months. Managing a brand and product portfolio is obviously a balance. In some categories where affordable pricing is more important part of the consumer value equation. We broaden our brand, product line, package size and price offerings to serve more consumer needs. Bounty and Bounty Basic, Charmin and Charmin Basic, Pampers and Luvs, Tide, Gain and now Tide simply clean and fresh. While we will continue to compete with product innovation and brand differentiation, we will not allow ourselves to be uncompetitive on a consumer value basis and segments where we choose to play. There are times we must and will make appropriate pricing adjustments to remain competitive. We\u2019re doing this now, which you know on a targeted basis in U.S. Fabric Care and Family Care where competitors have been price discounting and promoting heavily since last calendar year. In the end, we follow the shopper and the consumer. We meet their needs with consumer preferred P&G brands in better performing products, priced at a modest premium that delivers superior consumer value. We\u2019re currently entering the female, adult incontinence category. This is an attractive $7 billion global category growing at an annual rate of 7%. We\u2019re entering the category with consumer preferred superior performing products that deliver significant benefit advantages from Always, a brand women trust in prefer. We began shipments of Always, discrete in U.K. last month and we\u2019ll start shipments in North America and France over the next few weeks. We\u2019ll be sending you more details about this exciting new product line from Always next week. In September, we\u2019re launching Crest Sensi-Stop strips. This is a revolutionary new product technology that provides the tooth sensitivity relief like never before. One strip applied for just 10 minutes, delivers immediately and up to one month of protection from sensitivity, pain for many consumers. We\u2019re setting the brand and product innovation agenda in our industry. When we do this well, we build consumer preference for our brands, extend the level of product competitive advantage, build brand and product consumer preference accumulatively overtime, and capture a larger share of category value, profit and cash. The final area that will benefit from brand portfolio simplification is the consistency and quality of our brand building and selling execution. This execution is the only strategy our consumers and customers ever really see. We\u2019re bringing renewed focus to brands. When we get brands right, we deeply understand consumers and we create desirable ideas, iconic equities, and become a prototype in the category. We consistently express the brand promise with ideas that attract consumers to the product superior benefits to create trial, purchase lasting preference, and loyalty. This brand focus allows us to improve execution and build on those strategic brands to win ultimately with consumers. We\u2019re also focusing selling resources to improve coverage, expertise, and execution in key retail channels, wholesalers, and distributors. This should lead to improve distribution, shelving, merchandising and pricing execution to win consistently at the first moment of truth. We are and we will continue to increase coverage, sector and category dedication of our sales force and merchandisers in the store. I am excited by the opportunity to further elevate brand and selling execution and feel very strongly these efforts will be enabled by the portfolio focus we have embarked on. I am working directly the sector and SMO leaders on these opportunities to profitably accelerate top line growth, while Jon and the team continue leading the work on portfolio simplification and productivity. This portfolio transformation may take a little more time than any of us would like because streamlining the brand and product portfolio will be governed by our ability to create value on every exit. When we get there to our in effect P&G new-co with the streamlined 70 to 80 brand portfolio, this will enable faster and more sustainable growth and more reliable value creation through the end of the decade and beyond. We will be a simpler, faster growing, more profitable company that is far easier to manage and operate. We will be a company of brands that consumers prefer and customers support, well positioned competitively. A company of brands simpler to source, sell and service. The streamlined company of leadership household and personal care brands will deliver more reliable value creation for consumers and customers, partners and suppliers and will deliver reliably and sustainably total shareholder return in the top third of our industry peer group. I look forward to updating you on our progress when we meet for our Analyst Meeting here in Cincinnati in November. Now I will turn the call back to Jon to provide the details on our outlook for this year. Jon Moeller : We continue to expect global markets in our categories to grow in value terms 2% to 3%. Against this backdrop we are currently forecasting fiscal 2015 organic sales growth of low to mid-singles. With this level of growth, we will maintain or modestly grow global market share on a local currency basis. We think this is pragmatic and realistic starting point for our fiscal \u201815 financial commitments. Pricing should again be a positive contributor to organic sales growth, though likely not to the same degree we have seen over the past several years. Foreign exchange is expected to be a one point sales growth headwind. With this level of sales growth we are forecasting mid-single digit core earnings per share growth. We will benefit again from significant productivity savings, but like last year these will be partially offset by FX headwinds which won\u2019t annualize at current spot rates until the back half of the year. We have a few value corrections to make. We are also going to invest and consumer trial of preferred brands and major new product innovations that are in market and that are coming to market. We will continue to make investments in innovation and go to market coverage in the fastest growing sales channels. Non-operating income and tax should be roughly in line with prior year levels. And we are targeting to deliver 90% or better free cash flow productivity. Our plans assume capital spending in the range of 4% to 5% of sales and share repurchase in the range of $5 billion to $7 billion. At this level, share repurchase should net of option exercises contribute about one percentage of earnings per share growth. On an all-in GAAP basis we expect earnings per share to also grow mid-single digits including around $0.20 per share of non-core restructuring investments. In addition to the assumptions included in our guidance we want to continue to be very transparent about key items that are not included. The guidance we are providing today is based on last week\u2019s FX spot rates, further currency weakness including Venezuela is not anticipated within our guidance range. We continue to monitor unrest in several markets in the Middle East and Eastern Europe. And we continue to closely monitor markets like Venezuela and Argentina where pricing controls and import restrictions present risk. This guidance does not assume any major portfolio moves. We will update guidance as these occur. Finally, our guidance assumes no further degradation of market growth rates. There are a few things you should keep in mind as you construct your quarterly models, our toughest top line comps are in the first two quarters. The top and bottom line impacts from consumer value corrections will disproportionately affect the first quarter and the first half. FX impacts will not fully annualize until the back half and productivity savings will build as the year progresses. In summary we are pleased to have delivered an on target year on both the top and bottom lines, but realized there is more work to do. We are realistic about where we stand in the journey and are excited about the path ahead. That concludes our prepared remarks. As a reminder, business segment information is provided in our press release and will be available in slides, which will be posted in our website, www.pg.com following the call. AG and I will be happy now to take your questions. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank : Hi, gentlemen. Good morning. AG Lafley : Good morning, Bill. Jon Moeller : Good morning. Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank : Hey, can you give us a timeline for the sales of those your 90 businesses that have been deemed non-core? Jon Moeller : Well, as AG said in his remarks, the timing on this is going to be governed by our ability to create value, which we are committed to do as we exit this business as much as we have done exactly as we have done with the prior category and brand exits. And rough order of magnitude, this is I would guess, Bill, though I am not providing the specific guidance probably call it 12 to 24 months, but again, we are not going to be governed by timeline, we are going to be governed by value creation. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Faucher (JPMorgan). Please proceed. John Faucher - JPMorgan: Yes, thank you. Sort of continuing with this, one of the things you guys are working on is driving sort of more cost efficient structures and I guess how do you fragment some of these brand groups or is this I guess can you talk a little bit about how this is making the structure less complicated as you go to this many brand groups? And then secondly, as you look at some of the productivity efforts, can you talk a little bit about the focus on stranded overhead and do you feel like your recent productivity will allow you to eliminate some of the potential dilution from selling off some of these businesses? Thanks. Jon Moeller : So, John, first of all as we look at the portfolio in the way that AG described, we are really looking at it through a strategic lens and we are wanting to play in categories with brands, leadership brands that play to our strengths. We have talked before about the core capabilities that we believe we have as a company and very simply brands that leverage those capabilities have proven over time to sustainably create value. And those that don\u2019t fully leverage those capabilities on average, we have struggled with. And so part of this simplification if you will is just matching up our businesses with what we are good at and not having to struggle with some things that we are not as good at. So, that in itself is a big simplification. You can imagine going from a company of call it 160 brands to a company of 70 or 80 brands is in itself incredibly simplifying, the number of innovation platforms that we need to focus on, the number of manufacturing platforms that we need to focus on, the number of products that we need to sell to each and every customer and distributor. So, there is tremendous simplification that comes with this. To your specific question of stranded overheads, it is our objective and expectation that we will use the productivity savings that are available both through simplification that comes from portfolio focus, but also the productivity savings that come through the organization structure changes that AG talked about to in effect offset the stranded overhead impact. There will be some dilution as these businesses go out just as there have been with businesses that we have been divesting. But it will be on that order of magnitude and it will result primarily from the loss of operating earnings of those businesses. We will take care of the stranded overhead. AG Lafley : John, just a couple of additional points, I mean, this is the classic strategic choice. We want to be in the businesses we should be in, not the businesses we are in. Secondly, it is driven by shoppers and consumers in the market primarily. We are focusing on the brand and business portfolio in the four industries that consumers actually buy and prefer, right, that customers really support and can support, where we have very strong brand equities, where our net promoter scores are higher, where our brand positioning is well-differentiated and where the product performance delivers. So, it\u2019s very straightforward. And the objective is growth. The objective is balanced, profitable sales growth and much more reliable value creation, much more reliable generation of cash, primarily by cash and profit. In terms of the organization side, it\u2019s going to get a lot simpler. It\u2019s already begun to get simpler. A lot this is already underway, but we just have real clarity about what a regional selling operation does and what a business unit does. And they are now connected with far fewer handoffs and we will continue to improve that design to further reduce the handoffs. And we are just going to be much more agile and much more adaptable in a much quicker inside, much simpler inside, so we can deal with all of the change and the pace outside. That\u2019s really the objective here. Look, we had our last global leadership council meeting last week, okay, I don\u2019t know the number, Jon, what are there 30 to 40 people and go, okay we now have a lead team of about 10 of us. And basically the region leaders, the sector BU leaders, Jon and myself 10 to 12 of us, we meet more often, we work on the business, we get things done on a weekly \u2013 by weekly and monthly basis. So, we are just going to be more adaptable. We are going to be more agile. We are going to be more responsive. We are going to be able to make decisions a lot faster and turn the decisions into action in the market that really matters. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays Capital. Please proceed. Lauren Lieberman - Barclays Capital : Thanks. Good morning. Just two quick things. First was just around any kind of tax implications or risks from selling businesses at a very low cost basis? And then the second was how do you think you will be able to kind of ensure you don\u2019t lose shelf space or facings as you divest or discontinue brands? Thanks. Jon Moeller : On the tax question, Lauren, there will be some low business assets that will be part of the portfolio that\u2019s going to be disposed. We have done a pretty good job historically about managing that through tax efficient structures. Those do take time, which is what we are talking about when we say that value creation will guide the pacing of the exits. So, we will try to manage that as effectively as we can. AG, you want to talk about? AG Lafley : Yes. I mean, Lauren, obviously we have anticipated the concern that you raised and a whole bunch of other concerns that we have to manage through the transition and through all the details of the execution, but I guess I just mentioned three quick examples. One, in the U.S. we started out with a laundry brand portfolio of 15 brands, okay. Today, we have a brand portfolio of 5 and over the decades, our share has increased. And as we pointed out in my prepared remarks, our share is approaching 60 again. And more importantly, our share of the value created in that segment is at probably the highest level based on our calculations ever. So, I think there is a lot of evidence in a number of our business categories that the shopper and the consumer really don\u2019t want more assortment and more choice, they want efficient consumer response. If you just look at what\u2019s going on in the omni-channel and pure-play e-tailer environment with online shopping, we are doing a pretty doggone good subscription business. We are doing a good shopping list and automatic replenishment business, because in a lot of our categories, frankly, their low involvement and consumers want to keep their life simple and convenient. And having the leading brand, better performing products and a good value everyday helps them keep life simple and convenient. Two last very quick points, if you look at this company decade by decade at the end of the decade, all of our growth in value creation is driven by three things : one, we are able to grow and continue to create value from our core established brands and businesses going into the decade. Two, we\u2019re able to create, transform, or acquiring build at least one major new business. And three, we\u2019re able to move successfully in the new space. Okay, whether that\u2019s developing markets or new channels or whatever. And I suspect in2021, when we look back at this decade we\u2019re going to see the same pattern. We\u2019ve done a lot of analysis that shows more does not drive growth and more certainly does not drive value creation, absolute last point and you will know this one as well our better than I. When the team sort of got us into the beauty and personnel care business between 2000 and 2007, we tripled the sales from whatever was under 7 to 20 plus, we quadrupled a profit and we did it on half a dozen brand businesses. Pantene and Head & Shoulders, Olay, and SK-II, and a trio of fragrance brands accounted for virtually all of that growth in value creation in an industry that\u2019s notorious for activity and complexity. So I just believe very deeply that we\u2019re picking our spots in these industries that played our strengths and our assets and we\u2019re going forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citi Research. Please proceed. Wendy Nicholson - Citi Research : I had two questions. First, maybe for you AG, you said at the beginning that there were several businesses that missed plan during the course of the year. And I\u2019m curious whether that is \u2013 was predominately innovation at some short of expectations or misprice products or what the problems were and I think you said you feel more confident about your execution ability going forward. But may be specifically why is that, is it different people in charge or do you have a better sense of adoptability if things are going wrong. So, that\u2019s question number one. And then number two, Jon, your comments really surprised me, you said that for next year you only play in to maintain or modestly grow market share, which strikes me as a very \u2013 I don\u2019t know weak stands to enter the year, I mean, I would think with all the innovation and all your plan spending, you would have more confidence or more enthusiasm about your market share trends, thanks. Jon Moeller : Let me take the second part of that question and then turn it over to AG. Look, we\u2019re trying to establish very realistic external guidance that frankly is reflective of the macro environment that we\u2019re in as reflective of what we\u2019ve proven ourselves capable of delivering thus far. We delivered 3% organic sales growth this year or forecasting low to mid singles next year. We delivered 5% core earnings per share growth this year or forecasting mid singles for next year. We share completely your desire to do better than that and as we proved that capability if and as we prove that capability guidance will reflect that. AG Lafley : Wendy, on your first question, first to be very clear about what I said, it\u2019s just a couple \u2013 two businesses had delivered their operating plans. We would have achieved our internal goals of 4, 7, 5 operating, okay and generated of course even more cash, just two, okay. The issues were different in one business frankly, they let their pricing get out of line and the thing that was frustrating about it is, it was out of line and for whatever reasons, I don\u2019t feel like the team came to grips with that reality fast enough, okay? It\u2019s being fixed. It happened before in this category, we know how to fix it will get fixed. And ironically it was a business that had like a 10 or 12, your run of very strong balanced growth and value creation. In the other case, we got our nose ahead of the tips of our skis on an investment in a new line of brands and products. And we just need to get back to the discipline, okay, of testing and qualifying major investments that we are going to make. Hey, there is a lot of risk in the product innovation side. There is a lot of risk when you are making investments in the marketplace, but we try to and we have a track record of and when we are performing to our capability, we do a reasonably good job of testing things before we expand them. And we just got the investment way ahead of the actual results in the marketplace. Those are the two. The things I feel good about I should say is and my teams knows this is I actually feel very good that more of our businesses are executing better are sharpening their strategies and translating it into operating plans, and that our execution is improving. But hey, this is an intensely executional industry and we just absolutely we have to be at the top of our game all the time. Jon Moeller : And just one more point on this. While we did have problems in a couple of businesses as AG described, we had many businesses that had the best year they have had in a long time. AG Lafley : That\u2019s right. Jon Moeller : So for instance our Duracell business had a fantastic year. Our salon professional business had one of its best years in quite a long period of time. So there are many more things working than not working. Operator : Your next question comes from the line Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Dara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley : Good morning. So A.G. on the portfolio rationalization, can you discuss why you are implementing it now, the strategy makes sense, but what\u2019s kind of change is driving you to undertake this now. You previously outlined that 90% of the business was core and you expected divestitures, I am assuming the brand rationalization announcement today includes those businesses you already expected to divest or should we look at this as rationalization on top of that. And then last just given the process will take one to two years, are you committed to staying on board as CEO for as long as at least the bulk of the brand rationalization process takes? AG Lafley : Okay. Dara, stop me if I don\u2019t \u2013 if I don\u2019t capture all of your questions. Okay, last question first, the Board, I am serving at the pleasure of the Board and we are criteria driven, we are not schedule driven, okay. So obviously, I wanted to drive this strategy and accelerate it but that\u2019s totally driven by our understanding of shopper and consumer needs and wants and the realities, okay, of the marketplace whether we are talking about channels and customers whether we are talking about competitive factors or whatever. So this is purely consumer market and competitive driven strategic choice. Second thing is we are already underway, okay. So this is a continuation in acceleration. I mean we are underway on the portfolio pruning I just want to accelerate it, okay. We are underway on the organization redesign, I just want to accelerate it. We are underway on the major restructuring and productivity savings that were announced 2 to 2.5 years ago. I just want to get it to a logical end point for the first phase, so that we can focus on operating with excellence and growing this business and performing at our peak. And I am sorry the third part of the question was Dara remind me. Dara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley : Just why now specifically, I mean it makes sense but what drove you to make the change at this point? AG Lafley : Okay. Look, in an ideal world, okay, in an ideal world we would have done this at the depth of the financial crisis and recession. That would have been the perfect time to do with, if you think about it, right, dramatically focus, dramatically simplify. Get the cash flowing right and then once the bank is full, bide your time until the market starts to come again, right that would have been perfect, right. If we work Monday morning quarterbacks I could look over the last 40 years that would have been the perfect time. But I missed. We missed some of that opportunity. And frankly when you are in the middle of a financial crisis when you are watching oil approach $150 a barrel and chaos is reining around you in the biggest recession since the 30s you always \u2013 you don\u2019t always have the time to think through or the resources to act on a transformation of this seismic scope. But having said that, I don\u2019t see any reason to wait, I don\u2019t see any virtue in waiting another minute. And I guess the last thing I would say is just think about what we are going to undertake. I don\u2019t want to go out and spend $1 billion round numbers on totally redoing the sourcing and supply chain in North America and do it for the wrong business shape and size that would be a terrible mistake, right. So in a lot of other places we are making investments that are going to make this company stronger, help us operate better etcetera, etcetera. And we have to make sure that we are doing this for the business that we think we are going to have and we think we are going to run for at least the next five plus years or so. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Please proceed. Olivia Tong - Bank of America : Can you talk about what other strategies you considered, why is this the right strategy and why doesn\u2019t this at least in the interim take some focus away from fixing issues in the 70 to 80 brands that you are planning on keeping? AG Lafley : I don\u2019t see any trade off there Olivia. In other words, we will have more talent, more resource in our financial and people against the 70 to 80 brands. So I mean we are \u2013 we have been all over several of those businesses. And frankly I am involved with 10 to 15 of them working with the leadership team. So I don\u2019t see any trade off. Now I won\u2019t tell you that there \u2013 that we haven\u2019t taken on extra work for another year \u2013 year and a half maybe at most for parts of it. As Jon said maybe the last disposals are as far as 18 to 24 months away. But now job one is to take care of shoppers and consumers, work with our customers and suppliers and deliver the operating plans and commitment on the 70 to 80 core brands that make up the portfolio that\u2019s going to drive this company ahead. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo. Please proceed. Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo : Thanks. AG you highlighted P&G following the consumer as it relates to innovation at the premium side of categories and at higher price categories and I think you called out the success of innovation in high end laundry as an example. Now I understand like you don\u2019t report laundry standalone, but fabric and home was up 1% organically, the Nielsen data in the U.S. shows share erosion even following the launch activity obviously there was a lot of competition there with lot of deep discounting, you responded that your own deep discounting, I guess is this an anomaly what\u2019s happened in this category like how do you reconcile that the view that innovation is successful at the high end at least in this category? AG Lafley : Okay. Chris let\u2019s go through this one in some detail because I think it\u2019s instructive. And if you have the patience we will go through one or two others because I think they are instructive too. I would like to just take U.S. laundry and let\u2019s go back to about a year ago in early September when we were at Barclays. And you may recall that we announced a series of fabric care category brand and product innovations that would be coming to market in the middle or end of the first quarter of 2014. I think we said at that time that they included the extension and expansion of our Pods product innovation to Gain and Ariel and two other countries like China and Japan which I spoke. We announced strengthening of our heavy duty liquid product offerings the so called value added offerings to meet consumer needs that were unmet and we announced the introduction of Tide Simply Clean & Fresh to meet unmet consumer needs and mid-tier segment and category. I think at the time we pointed out that virtually all of the category growth and most of our P&G sales growth and value creation would come from the Pods and the value-added, heavy duty liquid, brands and product lines. So, let\u2019s look at when happened, while in September and October, the media and many of our analysts commented on the program, and 95% of the commentary was on Tide Simply Clean. In October, November, and December, our three main economy competitors all unleashed a series of essentially price rollbacks and price discounting and temporary promotion after temporary promotion, all of which has continue to present. We started shipping in mid to late February. And frankly, we couldn\u2019t keep up with all demand of customers. So, we were probably well established in stores that retail by March and the beginning of April. Now, let\u2019s look at what\u2019s going on with the market shares, week-by-week from let\u2019s say the time that we really got established by retail. Well, lo and behold, we\u2019ve increased market share every week, okay, and if you look at our past 52 week share and compare it to our past four week share were up a full share point. Now, what else went on in the market, well, with all of that spending by the economy players, they essentially took dollars out of the category, which concerned some of the retailers and basically they traded cases, dollars, and share and made less profit on the ones they trade it. So, yes, there was a winner in that group, but they were also losers in that group. I think there is some indication. We think there is some early indication that may be we\u2019ve reached the point where it\u2019s pretty clear about what the middle and premium part of this category is going to look like and what the economy part of this category is going to look like. And then if we turn to Tide Simply, I think we said last September that the worst case scenario would be \u2013 we get a big share and we cannibalize from ourselves. While we\u2019ve gotten a medium size share frankly about what we thought it might be and we still don\u2019t know where to land up because it\u2019s still only got 50 plus percent retail distribution and relatively low travel rates among its target, but over 60% of it has been net extra to us. So, I don\u2019t look at this week versus the same week year ago. I don\u2019t look at this quarter versus the same quarter a year ago. I look at shares overtime. We\u2019re on our way, we think back to 60 a share, we have only had 60 a share of dollars a few times in the history of this company and in fact peak, it\u2019s not a 62 to 63 when one of our principle competitors withdrew from the market back in 2007. But we have a higher share, the higher share we\u2019ve ever had at the value created. So, that\u2019s how we think about it. I know I\u2019ve gone on a bit, but I just want to mention a couple of others so that you get the point. We didn\u2019t talk about at this morning. But in our diaper business in the U.S. and North America, we\u2019d rather quietly move back to share leadership, which we lost 20 years ago when our competitors brought training pants to market and we recaptured it in the last 18 months and we\u2019ve opened up a spread of almost 6 share points on diapers and I think a couple of share points plus on the whole baby care category that counts wipes and some of the other product lines. But how do we do that, okay, how do we do that without pants? Well, we did it because our baby stage of developments line of product and particularly Swaddlers which is unique consumer preferred etcetera has just cumulatively year-after-year slowly, but surely increased its trial, increased its share and is now just in and of its own right, a $600 million sub-brand that we think, now that we offer Swaddlers on all sizes, now we are finding moms actually prefer the designs could become a $1 billion business. So, my only point is I want to look at the cumulative impact of our brands and our products. Last point, in 2007, we introduced a novel totally new proprietary product and technology on Always. It was called Infinity. I think we weren\u2019t as clear as we could be with consumers about what the product was and what it did, but without boring you in all the details, it is a very unique ultra-thin phone product far and away the best absorbing. This past year, we had all kinds of issues trying to get a totally new technology in manufacturing process started up. We struggled as I said to connect with consumers, but this last year we did over $200 million on Always Infinity. We have now expanded into parts of Asia and parts of Europe. It represented 15% to 20% of our growth. It\u2019s a clearly superior product. Women who have tried it and purchased it are repurchasing it at a rate of 60% to 70%. So, I actually see across most of our categories, brands and products that are really unique and/or highly differentiated that when properly presented to consumers when the values clearly explained and if they have a chance to try it, that we can drive a lot of conversion. And final point, I am not going to take you through the details, but virtually every brand and product line we sell even in the U.S. is dramatically under-tried, dramatically under-tried. So, we will be back at ensuring that consumers who are prospects for these brands and product lines have a chance to really try the product and give it a chance. Sorry, Chris, I went on a long time, but I wanted to make the broader point about brand differentiation, product superiority, and consumer preference. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed. Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets : Yes, thanks. Hey, AG, maybe you can just provide a little bit more context on the streamlined portfolio, will there be a geographic angle for this as well or is it just hey, these are the 80 brands that we are going to focus on globally, or if you look at it on India or Venezuela or Brazil, are there certain brands that maybe you will pullback from even though they are a global brand? Thanks. AG Lafley : Okay. Understandable question, I am going to \u2013 hopefully, I will be able to answer this as clearly as possible. Remember, Nik, we are shopper and consumer driven. And that means where all of the shopping and consumption occurs locally. So, if and when we get this right, we will have the right mix of brands, product lines, and SKUs for China. We will have the right mix for Brazil. We will have the right mix for the Arabian Peninsula and Turkey. We will have the right mix for India and the sub-Sahara. Okay, so this is totally shopper and consumer driven. We looked at the real growth and value creation potential. And as I pointed out, these are brands that for sometime have not been delivering on that front, okay. So, yes, if we get this right, we will have the right \u2013 we will not be short of brands or products to win in any market we choose to compete in. And eventually, I think as you know, that\u2019s going to mean all the emerging markets of the world, because that\u2019s where the demographics will be driving us. That\u2019s where the babies are born. That\u2019s where the households form. That\u2019s where incomes are rising. So, we think this positions us just as well in emerging markets as it does in any developed market. Jon Moeller : And if you think about the screen, we talked about earlier, Nik, which is businesses that play to our strengths. Typically, when we are operating the business that does play to our strengths, we can operate that business globally. And so this is not a \u2013 there is not a geographic frame to this. It\u2019s as AG said consumers, shoppers match with P&G strengths. AG Lafley : Yes. And Nik, just one more thing, so again in our attempt to help everyone understand, in some cases, it\u2019s simple. We sell one brand name everywhere in the world, Pampers, Pantene, okay. In some we sell two, Always Whisper. In some of our lines in fabric, in home, in beauty and personal care, we sell what we call clone brands. Okay? So, the principal brand might be Rejoice okay, but we sell Rejoice under a different name, okay in individual markets, because that\u2019s sort of the history of the brand. We keep those brands, same in laundry, same in cleaning. So, we are very practical. We are very consumer and customer driven. And we worked outside in from the markets to our brands and then to our business categories and sectors. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Please proceed. Ali Dibadj - Bernstein: Hey, guys. So, before I get to the question and I often hate doing this, but I think it\u2019s worth just a comment, because I have heard it from many investors. I am not sure you did yourselves many favors on the \u2013 in the press release not talking about the quarter really at all. So, we all got to Page 13 or whatever it was saying that there is some rounding and beauty was down three, but there is no explanation, I am not sure you did yourself any favors. So, just for the sake of it heard from a lot of people, want to put it out there. The question though more is around just again learning more about this very interesting structural change. So, it feels like I think most people\u2019s ingoing assumptions was 10% of the business that was going to be divested was going to be more along business segment lines. And now I think you are flipping a little bit and talking about it from a branding line. So, I want to understand that if that\u2019s true? And then a few questions that come out of that. One is lots of changes and the rationale is focus, which I get, but where do you know where the right balance is? So, why isn\u2019t something even further like a bigger breakup not the right answer? How did you make that decision? And then also from a focus perspective, if these brands are going to sell, are about 10% of the sales, 5% of operating profit, can you give us a sense of how much of your time, management\u2019s time and resources were on those? And then last want to go back to a question from before, I give you another chance, if AG, the Board says we want you here through this 12 to 24-month period, big transition period, we trust you to do this, do you want to be there for that time? Thanks for all those. AG Lafley : Criteria-driven, I am having fun. I am full of energy. I am 24/7. So, that will take care of the last one. Jon Moeller : If my e-mail volume is any indication, it just backs up what AG said, he is here and working hard. AG Lafley : Second point, Ali, it\u2019s strategy first structure second, right. Structure supports strategy. Third point is ultimately it\u2019s about competitive advantage and value creation, right. So, we don\u2019t see \u2013 we see competitive advantage in multi-industry sector participation. We see competitive advantage in technologies that flow across categories and industries. We see competitive advantage in sourcing as a company and providing information and other services as a company and purchasing as a company. So, when we do the math on the value creation, we get to this choice, strategic choice, this set of businesses has the potential to be the biggest value creator, right, which should be in the interest not only of our company, but also of our shareowners. But yes, I mean, the balanced point is a very fair one and I am not going to tell you that any of us are good enough to get this precisely right. And you know what we will adjust as we go. I can\u2019t tell you whether a 50-brand company might not be a little bit better than a 70-brand company if you see what I mean, okay. The last point to your direct question is the management distraction is episodic intermittent and not the driver. The activity and complexity that clogs us up is the real issue, okay. Let\u2019s just take SKUs, okay. I don\u2019t know what the end result will be here, it\u2019s being worked business-by-business and iteratively, but believe me the SKU reduction will be a lot bigger than the 10% up to sales line or revenue line. Let\u2019s take product lines, the same, okay. So all of the sudden, one of the reasons that a number of our businesses have performed better is because the businesses and the R&D team and I all sat down in July and we sat down several times since and we just pruned out the bottom 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% of the activity and focused on few others and that\u2019s accelerated better products to market. The businesses \u2013 some of the businesses that Jon mentioned in other businesses that did really well this last year didn\u2019t well because there were extremely focused. And the last point and I could use the whole bunch of different examples here when you\u2019re carrying the bag, I\u2019ll use the old metaphor, with all the P&G brands and product lines in it to distributor or wholesaler to one of our sophisticated retail customers believe me, it is a huge advantage to be selling fewer leading consumer and shopper preferred brands and product lines. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Steib with Credit Suisse. Please proceed. Michael Steib - Credit Suisse : Thank you, good morning. I have a couple of questions please. AG, you mentioned, you emphasized really the importance of having the right balance between premium priced products on the one hand and affordable products on the other hand, where the consumer demands it. I was wondering in the core brand portfolio of 70 to 80 brands that you have identified now. Do you think that that balance is right at this point? And in other words, should the sort of negative mix effect on the top line going forward be less of a headwind once you\u2019ve gone through these various disposals? That\u2019s my first question. And then Jon, forgive me just for asking a financial question, but given your outlook for fiscal \u201815, you suggested that essentially the top line growth is going to be against tough comps in the first half and cost savings will build through the year? Should we therefore expect earnings growth to be sort of flattish in the first half and it all comes good in the second half? Thanks. Jon Moeller : A couple of things and one on the expectation of the reduction and negative mix on the top-line as we go forward, that will in all likelihood continue. We\u2019ve been pretty clear about that. It\u2019s driven by disproportionate growth in developing markets, which we expect to continue and as we move consumers up those portfolios overtime that impact will lesson as developed market growth is reintegrated that dynamic will lessen, but it has been with us and we\u2019ll likely be with us for some period of time. On the guidance question, we\u2019re not providing quarterly guidance, but all dynamics that you talked about are the right ones. I think you focus on the right things and I\u2019ve encouraged you to follow-up with the IR team later today. And I\u2019ll let AG to handle the question on whether we\u2019re priced right broadly. AG Lafley : Yes, Michael, let me try to make the couple of strategic points and then I\u2019ll try to give you some insight into where we think we are at this moment in time. The first thing is incredibly important and often not well understood and that is the issue in our industry in household products and personal care products is almost always consumer perception of value and value has different drivers in different categories and different brands. Price is one of them. Okay, price is one of them, but brand awareness and trial rates and household penetration, brand equity, okay, product performance also are incredibly important. Second point, we have a huge opportunity to get a lot clearer with consumers about what the value equation really is. I am going to give you a specific example from Gillette. We talked earlier that we just introduced FlexBall and it\u2019s off to a good start. We will see how it does. Alright. We did pre-market research in a blind context, so they don\u2019t know what the brand is and the new FlexBall razor was preferred 2 to 1 by system users versus the best performing product in the market, which happened to be our ProGlide. We are now in the market four, six, eight weeks. We went out and did a 400 male person panel, where we asked them to use the new FlexBall razor versus whatever they are using today. So, we had disposable users. We had shave club users. We had system users. We had electric razor users. 95% of them preferred a FlexBall, 95%. Interestingly, a lot of disposable users by the way half of the world, okay, uses the disposable razor today. The interesting thing is disposable users often say they use disposables because they think it shaves just as well as a system, many of them have never used a system. And they think it\u2019s a better value. So, their first belief if they try and use the FlexBall, they see it is a totally different experience and result. And then the second thing is when you ask them what they think the prices or the cost is or the value is, they always say it\u2019s way more expensive when we tell them. You can have a cartridge for $1 a week, they are astounded and then we show them the math. So, my only point here is if you just read the Wall Street Journal, okay or if you just listen to the anecdotes in the Street or if you look at the $50 for 10 cartridge pricing in some retail establishments, you may perceive that the price is high, but the actual price per use and the actual quality and performance of the use is better. And that\u2019s incredibly important. Now, that the direct question, I said in my prepared remarks where in some businesses, where the price point doesn\u2019t matter or in fact a higher price point is better. I saw more SK-II when my price point is better. We sell a lot of Oral-B electric toothbrushes at very high price points and I could go on and on throughout our line. But if you step back and look at all of our businesses around the world, we are in the best shape we have been in three years in terms of our relative pricing. In other words, we have the smallest percentage of our total business that has a price gap and is losing share. And here is the important part. The three biggest opportunities are tissue towel in North America, which is Bounty and Charmin and laundry, which Chris asked me about earlier, all of which are being addressed, okay. Interesting point there on laundry is major retailers are sort of discounting Tide 15% to 20%. It\u2019s still a better deal for them, because Tide at a 15% discount is the higher price and generates more value for them than the balance of the category. Last point on this one, the number of opportunities we have, where we are priced low where we should be or mixing below where we should be are as large or greater than the opportunities we have to adjust our price. Operator : And your final question comes from the line of Steve Powers with UBS. Please proceed. Steve Powers - UBS: Believe it or not a few more questions, if I could. First Jon, maybe I missed it, but did you offer any cost or timing estimates associated with the supply chain restructuring that you are undertaking. And then second taking a step back you are clearly making progress on the cost cutting especially in SG&A, but the top line continues to lag a bit, this quarter it does feel like you rounded up 2% organic growth in the quarter, so does it make sense to drop all these marketing efficiencies to the bottom line or should you be reinvesting even more aggressively. And then lastly maybe related to that, AG as you said it all starts with the consumer and you guys have been long known for leading consumer insight capabilities, so what specifically is the consumer telling you that you need to do better in the market that you are not doing and maybe you can just talk about that in the context of beauty for example? Thanks. Jon Moeller : In terms of the marketing I mean we are perfectly happy to reinvest and are looking for opportunities to reinvest and feel that we can do that and continue to become both more effective and more efficient. We are going through a transformation in this industry that we want to take advantage of while remaining fully in front of consumers with our marketing efforts. And so we look at things like the reach, the frequency, the targets that we are reaching, the conversion rates on the messaging and that\u2019s much more important than actual dollars spent given what\u2019s happened in that industry. But you should not mistake this for a second as lack of willingness to invest behind smart ideas to build the top line. AG Lafley : Yes. We are maintaining or increasing our investment in marketing that works and we are driving for savings and frankly non-working dollars or other efficiencies that you get from the move to more digital mobile, social, etcetera. On the consumer insight side that is the focus, the full focus of a lot of people in this organization. And again I think we had a lot of activity going on and we weren\u2019t relentless about digging, digging, digging for shopper insights and consumer insights. Very simple thing, the mindset at Gillette was to test the new system with system users. You sort of slap yourself in the forehead and say well, wait a second. Everybody grooms, some people do a clean shave some people do a sculptured groom in the face. Some people body groom. Let\u2019s first of all understand what the job to be done is. And then second of all let\u2019s make sure we are putting together instruments, okay and experiences that meet all the needs. So I mean we are going to sell an opening price point disposable razor from Gillette at I don\u2019t know $2 to $3 and we will take you all the way up to $200 to $300 if you want to buy art of shaving product or a top of the line Braun product. Specifically regarding beauty, look here is the headline on beauty. In terms of value creation they were one of the better performing sectors this last year. Unfortunately it was a little unbalanced, too much of the value creation came from cash and profit improvement, although I will take it and there is a lot more there. Secondly, the progress we are making, okay. The Old Spice and Safeguard some of the hair care brands we had \u2013 we showed some real progress on Pantene in a lot of important countries around the world, still not the progress I would like. In the U.S. we had a little bit of share pickup in the first quarter which excited some of our competitors and turned into a second quarter that was heavily promoted, but anyway we will get through that. But Pantene is growing very strongly in important places like Brazil it was growing in \u2013 sequentially in China, it\u2019s growing and in a lot of developed and emerging markets. And I can see the product program starting to come. Head & Shoulders has just gone from strength to strength. Herbal is growing again. Vidal is growing again in key markets. So I think that\u2019s going to come. And then before the year was out, even on Olay which is still struggling we have some real encouragement in a couple of places. We had two of the top five new facial cleanser products, two of the top five new facial moisturizer products. And this line called Luminous is actually driving a little bit of share growth in the past couple of months. So, the bigger point, okay, the bigger point is the one you made, which is everything begins with shopper understanding and consumer understanding. And when we have it and understand it that informs importantly and allows us to do a much better job with our brand idea and our product pipeline and portfolio. Jon Moeller : I want to thank everybody for joining us this morning. I realized we didn\u2019t get to everybody. It\u2019s a cheap substitute, but I am available the balance of the day. Don\u2019t hesitate to call, John and the team, are here as well. And we thank you for your participation. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a great day.",

Today\u2019s discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G\u2019s most recent 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the Company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from these projections. As required by Regulation G, P&G needs to make you aware that during the call, the Company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Management believes these measures provide investors valuable information on the underlying growth trends of the business. Organic refers to reported results, excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, where applicable. Free cash flow represents operating cash flow less capital expenditures. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings adjusted for impairment charges. Any measure described as core refers to the equivalent GAAP measure, adjusted for certain items. Currency neutral refers to the equivalent GAAP measure excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate changes. P&G has posted on its Web site, www.pg.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP and other financial measures. Now, I will turn the call over to P&G\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller. Jon Moeller : Good morning. July to September was a challenging quarter from a macro standpoint with slowing market growth in both developed and developing regions. Strong foreign exchange headwinds, market level challenges in the Ukraine, Russia and the Middle East, Venezuela, Argentina, and Hong Kong, and increased consumption taxes in several large markets including Japan and Mexico. Despite this we were able to deliver top and bottom-line results for the July-September quarter, which were in line with our going-in expectations. Organic sales grew 2% and were in line or ahead of year ago in all reporting segments. Organic volume was in line with the prior year, pricing added more than a point to sales growth and sales mix was positive. All-in sales were roughly equal to prior year including more than a point of headwind from foreign exchange and the impact of brand divestitures. Core earnings per share were $1.07, up 2% versus the prior year. Excluding FX, core earnings per share grew 9%. Core gross margin was up 20 basis points, cost savings up approximately 140 basis points and benefits from pricing were partially offset by foreign exchange, higher commodity costs, innovation and capacity investments and negative margin mix. Core SG&A cost as a percentage of sales increased 30 basis points, 70 basis points of overhead savings and 50 basis points of marketing savings were more than offset by foreign exchange impacts and investments in R&D and selling capabilities. Total productivity savings in cost of goods sold and SG&A were 260 basis points. Core operating margin was down 20 basis points versus the prior year. The effective tax rate on core earnings was about 23% nearly 2 points higher than the fiscal year guidance of about 21%. September quarter all-in GAAP earnings per share were $0.69, which includes approximately $0.03 per share of non-core restructuring charges, $0.04 per share of charges related to a change in the exchange rate at which certain historical Venezuela and receivables will be paid, and a penny per share of benefit from earnings of the discontinued Pet Care operations, also included is a $0.32 per share non-core, non-cash charge to write down goodwill and certain intangibles of our Battery business. Duracell is a strong brand equity in Personal Power, an attractive business but we are writing the asset down to be more reflective of the value we'll receive and they recently announced sale of our interest in the Nanfu Battery joint venture. We generated $3.6 billion in operating cash flow and $2.8 billion in free cash flow with 96% adjusted free cash flow productivity, reflecting our focus on balanced growth and value creation. This quarter is the best first quarter cash performance in the past five years, improved results on payables including good progress on our supply chain financing program was a main driver of the strong cash performance. We returned $4.2 billion of cash to shareholders including 1.8 billion in dividends and 2.4 billion in share repurchase. In summary, first quarter sales and core earnings growth were in line with going-in expectations and we continue to build on our strong track-record of cash productivity and cash return to shareholders. We expect the headwinds facing our industry to continue. We are consequently continuing to sharpen our strategies, accelerate and increase productivity savings and strengthen our execution. As we announced last quarter, we\u2019re taking an important strategy step-forward to streamline, simplify and strengthen the Company\u2019s business and brand portfolio. We will become a simplifier and more focused company of 70 to 80 category-leading competitively-advantaged brands organized into about a dozen business units and four industry-based sectors. We\u2019ll compete in businesses that are structurally attractive and play to P&G\u2019s strengths, where we can achieve sustainable advantage. Every brand we plan to keep is strategic with a potential to grow and create value. The core 70 to 80 brands are leaders in their industries, categories or segments. They are brands shoppers buy, consumers use and customers support. They\u2019re leaders in brand equity, awareness, trial, purchase and loyalty. They\u2019re leaders in product performance and product innovation, and leaders in growth and value-creation. Over the next 18 to 24 months we will create a faster growing more profitable Company that is far simpler to operate. In the September we complete the exit of the Pet Care business. We closed the divestiture of the Americas Pet business to Mars in July. Mars then executed their option to purchase the business in Asia and last month we signed an agreement to divest the European Pet business to Spectrum Brands. All remaining elements of these transactions should close in calendar year 2015, pending regulatory approval. We generated very good value in this three-stage transaction earning more than a 20x EBITDA multiple on past three year average results. The Pet Care exit transitions seven brands to new owners. In total over the last five quarter we have divested discontinued or made decisions to consolidate about 25 brands. Today we are announcing the exit of the Personal Power or Battery business. Our goals in this process are to maximize value to P&G\u2019s shareholders and minimize earnings per share dilution. There are two steps to this plan. In late August we finalized an agreement to sell our interest in a China-based battery joint venture in a cash transaction. The second step is the exit of the Duracell business. Although no decision has been on the form of exit, our preference is currently a split-off of the Duracell business into a standalone company. Duracell is the global battery market leader with attractive operating profit margins. It\u2019s a brand equity and products innovation leader in the category with a history of strong cash generation. It will receive greater priority and attention as its own company. If we choose to pursue a split-off transaction P&G shareholders will be given the option of exchanging some, none or all of their shares, for P&G for shares in the newly formed Duracell Company. P&G\u2019s outstanding share count would be reduced by the number of P&G shares exchanged. The exact exchange ratio will be set just prior to the completion of the transaction which we expect will occur in the second half of calendar 2015. While a split-off is our preference, any alternative exit scenario that generates equal or better value will be fully considered. We are developing incremental savings plans to offset standard overheads that remain in our core cost structure to minimize the dilutive impact of exiting the Duracell business. For the time being, Duracell will continue to be reported in our core results. As we continue to strengthen our category and brand portfolio, we will strengthen and focus our brand building and product innovation efforts and investments against our biggest opportunities. We are committed to be the brand and product innovation leader in the categories in which we compete. Year-after-year, decade-after-decade successful brand building and supported by product innovation has built our businesses, transformed our categories and created entirely new businesses. Innovation, vast commoditization stimulates category growth and builds accumulative advantage of our brands overtime. With branding and product innovation, we built leading positions in laundry and many markets. In the U.S. we have nearly a 60% share of the U.S. laundry market sales and earn about 85% of the profit in cash generated in the category. We launched our North American Fabric Care brand and product innovation bundle about 8 months ago and upgraded Tide Plus line up that make our best liquid detergents even better. Gain Flings that accelerate consumer conversion to new premium unit dose detergents. Tide Simply Clean & Fresh that provides value to our consumers and new and better option from a brand they aspire to use, new sizes in scents of Downy Unstopables and Gain Fireworks, and the addition of Bounce Bursts to the scent portfolio. Innovations like these build on the consumer and competitive advantages our brands have created over decades. Innovations like these enable us to earn a leading share of market sales and an even greater share of market profit and value creation. Innovations like these stimulate market growth. They spark new consumer interest in the category and grow market baskets. They trade consumers up to higher performing products. Tide Pods and Gain Flings are priced at more than double the average price per load in the detergent category, and are still very affordable for the vast majority of consumer households. Over the last 30 years the price of a load of laundry has lagged the price of cheese or eggs and is a much better value than a cup of coffee or a bottle of soda. The U.S. category\u2019s two biggest laundry brands Tide and Gain have each grown market share over the past 4, 13, 26 and 52 week periods. Tide value share was up 2 points for the quarter. Tide Simply Clean & Fresh is nearly a 3 share with cannibalization results better than expected. Distribution of Simply Clean & Fresh continues to grow with a top U.S. retailer expanding to full national distribution earlier this month. P&G\u2019s unit dose business across Tide and Gain is 9% share of the total U.S. detergent market. We have over 75% share of the unit dose form. We are continuing to leverage our consumer preferred unit dose form with Tide Free & Gentle Pods which started shipping in July. Just over a year ago we introduced a broad range of Baby Care products innovation in North America. Nearly every Diaper across all sizes and price peers was improved to deliver better absorbency, comfort or design. Our premium mom preferred Diaper design Swaddlers was extended in the sizes 4 and 5 and subsequently size 6. P&G\u2019s U.S. market-leading Diaper share is now nearly 44%, up more than 3 points versus a year ago. On a global basis, P&G has about 35% of the global Diaper share and earns about half the profit in the category. We\u2019ve built this leading Baby Diaper business despite the absence of a consumer preferred pant style Diaper offering. We\u2019re now launching Pampers Premium Care Pants beginning in Russia. Pampers Pants provides exceptional skin comfort and dryness benefits in an underwear-like design, that should add to cumulative products and equity advantages we\u2019ve established with Pampers. Gillette has a long history of innovation, blades and razors that reset the performance standards in the industry. Overtime, we\u2019ve earned nearly a 70% share of blades and razor sales globally and a 90% share of value and profit. ProGlide FlexBall our newest innovation is the first razor designed to respond to the contours of men\u2019s face, maintaining maximum contact and delivering a closer and more complete and comfortable shave. Every man has a different shaped face, One Gillette FlexBall and cartridge delivers a uniquely better, closer, more comfortable shave for everyone. Prelaunch testing indicated men preferred FlexBall 2 :1 versus the bestselling razor in the world our own Fusion ProGlide. Post-launch men who have used FlexBall indicate closer to a 90% preference rate. Trial has come from across the category with an encouraging 25% from disposable users. In the four months since launch, we\u2019ve seen an improvement in U.S. blades and razors market growth including more than a 25% spike in razor sales and have seen sequential improvement in our razor shares over the past 12, 6, and 3 month periods. Gillette earned nearly 80% of the male razor sales and nearly 90% of male cartridge sales in the U.S. last quarter. We\u2019ll begin the global expansion of ProGlide FlexBall early next calendar year. Also next year, we\u2019ll extend our breakthrough FlexBall technology to women with our market-leading Venus brand. FlexBall offers clear benefits to women helping them to easily manage tricky spots such as knees and ankles. Women who have tried the new razor love it, preferring it 3 :1 over the current global bestselling women\u2019s razor Venus Embrace. We believe we can grow the adult incontinence category with innovation, transform the desired consumer experience and increase consumer, customer and shareholder value. This is currently an attractive $7 billion global category growing in an annual rate of 7%. Women aren\u2019t satisfied with current product offerings 1 in 3 women over 18 years old suffers from incontinence, but only 1 in 9 uses an adult incontinence product of any kind. That spells consumer dissatisfaction which spells opportunity for P&G. We\u2019re entering the category with superior pad and pant-style products that deliver better fit and protection from Always, a brand that women trust and prefer. We began shipments of Always Discreet in the UK in July where market growth is accelerated by 20% since our launch. We have quickly grown to over 9% value share. We started shipping Always Discreet in North America and France in August in less than two full months in the market. The U.S. adult incontinence market growth rate has accelerated to 10% and we\u2019ve grown to over a 7% value share. Last month, we launched Crest Sensi-Stop Strips providing unprecedented tooth sensitivity relief. Unlike toothpaste that takes several weeks to reduce sensitivity and need to be used twice per day, one Sensi-Stop Strip applied for 10 minutes provides immediate relief and up to one month of protection from sensitivity pain for sound consumers. This is another significant market growth opportunity, nearly 60% of American\u2019s suffer from sensitive teeth, but only 4 in 10 are satisfied with their available sensitivity product solutions. Our focus now is on driving awareness and trial of this revolutionary new treatment for tooth sensitivity sufferers. In July, we introduced QlearQuil a product innovation that extends Vicks into allergy treatments. This innovation leverages a very strong and trusted Vicks band equity across a variety of products including nighttime, daytime and 24-hour treatments. QlearQuil is a great product for the numerous occasional sinus and allergy sufferers who only want relief when they need it and don\u2019t want or need everyday preventative dosing. In September, we launched a new bundle of Metamucil brand. This includes a base brand restage of Metamucil fiber with a new satiety benefit of helps you feel less hungry between meals. In addition to its current heart health, blood sugar and digestive health benefits. Meta Bars our new fiber bar form that fit with consumer lifestyles and capitalize on the rapid growth of the health bar, meal supplement and snack category. MetaBiotic is a new probiotic that puts Meta into the fast growing immunity benefit space. As I said earlier, we\u2019re committed to be the brand and product innovation leader in our categories and we\u2019re increasing investment behind it. The best companies in any industry find a way to lead brand, product and business model innovation and productivity, returning productivity into core strength of P&G, making it a systemic and enduring value creation pillar alongside innovation. We have significantly accelerated and will significantly exceed the $10 billion cross savings goal we set 2.5 years ago. We\u2019re driving cost of goods savings well above the original target run rate of $1.2 billion per year. We\u2019ll be above target again this year for the third consecutive year with strong savings across materials, manufacturing expense and logistics. We expect to improve manufacturing productivity by at least 6% again this year, reducing staffing even as we add capacity and start-up new production modules. We have begun work and what is probably the biggest supply chain redesign in the Company\u2019s history moving from primarily single-category production sites to fewer multi-category production plans. The supply chains will be informed, excuse me the supply chain plans will be informed by portfolio decisions that we have made. We build the supply chain around the future portfolio, not the one we have today. We are taking the opportunity to simplify, standardize and upgrade manufacturing platforms. For faster innovation, qualification and expansion and improved product quality. We are transforming our distribution network in the United States consolidating customer shipments into fewer distribution centers. These centers are strategically located closer to key customers and key population centers enabling 80% of the business to be within one day of the store shelf and the shopper. We now have two our new U.S. distribution centers up and running and we will open the other four in early 2015. Earlier this month, we announced steps to streamline our distribution network in France, consolidating to fewer larger distribution centers. The distribution network projects will allow both P&G and our retail partners to optimize inventory levels, while still improving service and on-shop availability and reducing in-store out-of-stocks. We have now established a $1 billion to $2 billion value creation target for our global supply chain reinvention effort. We have doubled the associated cost of goods savings target from this global effort from 200 million to 300 million up to 400 million to 600 million in annual savings building to this target level over the next three years to five years. These savings are incremental to the $6 billion of cost of goods savings we originally communicated and are on-track to exceed. We expect addition top and bottom-line benefits from improved service levels. We have reduced non-manufacturing enrollment by 16% in three years, enabled by several important organization design choices. We have organized around four industry-based sectors, we are streamlining and de-duplicating the work of business units and selling operations. We have consolidated a four brand building functions into one. Each of these changes reduces complexity and each creates clear accountability for performance and results. A more focused portfolio of brands and businesses will enable further changes. In the first quarter, we again reduced enrollment versus the prior quarter despite the addition of many of this year\u2019s new hires to our enrollment ranks. We have additional opportunity to improve marketing efficiency in both media and non-media areas, while increasing overall marketing effectiveness and the strength of our programs. We continue to drive marketing productivity through an optimized mix driven by new, more efficient digital, mobile and social media. We are making targeted reinvestments to support strong innovation. We increased marketing support behind the Tide brand in the U.S. by 60 basis points last year, and increased Campus market in the U.S. by 230 basis points. As we generate efficiencies, we will look for good opportunities to put some of those savings back to work to improve top-line growth. The final priority that I will touch on this morning is execution. The only strategy our consumers and customers actually see. We are bringing a renewed focus to brands, building leadership brands with iconic equities that become the prototype in their categories, consistent expression of the brand promise with ideas that attract consumers to the brand\u2019s superior benefit. Create trial, ongoing preference and lasting loyalty. Building trial with targeted advertising and sampling is a significant opportunity for many of our brands. For example thousands of recent male high school graduates will receive ProGlide FlexBall razors. The babies in the 80% to 90% of new moms in the U.S. will try Pampers while they are in the hospital. Many buyers and new dishwashers or a cloth washing machines will have to opportunity to try our best Cascade and Tide product innovations. We are focusing selling resources to improve coverage, expertise and execution in the key retail channels wholesalers and distributors that make a difference. This will lead to improve distribution, shelving, merchandising and pricing execution to consistently win at the first moment of truth. We are and will continue to increase the amount of sector and category dedication of our salesforce to improve category expertise and tenure and increase channel coverage. Improving our branding and selling execution will be significantly enabled by the business and brand portfolio focus we have embarked on. The strategic strengthening of our portfolio, innovation investment in core categories, strengthened and accelerated productivity efforts and stronger marketing and selling execution should enhance our results. We are operating though in an extremely difficult macro environment with an increasing number of issues. In Russia, the Ukraine, the Middle East, Argentina and Venezuela with the dollar that continues to strengthen, with markets that continue to decelerate and with increasing commodity cost despite lower crude oil prices. We are making targeted investments in our value equations and are increasing the level of investment in our brands and product innovation. With all this considered, we are maintaining previous organic sales and core earnings per share guidance ranges, while we work to try to offset the macro headwinds with more productivity savings, pricing for FX and market accretive innovation-enabled top-line growth. Our forecast for organic sales growth remains at a range of low to mid single-digits. We now expect foreign exchange to be a negative 2 point impact on sales growth and a 5 to 6 point headwind on core earnings per share growth. This is roughly double the impact we had estimated last quarter. We\u2019re maintaining our core earnings per share growth guidance range of mid single-digits while FX currently skews us towards the lower end of this range, we will do our best to try to offset these impacts with productivity savings and pricing, without comprising increased investments and brand equities, value equations, innovation and selling capability. This is what we were able to successfully do last year. Excluding FX we\u2019re now forecasting double-digit core earnings per share growth for the fiscal year. On an all-in GAAP basis, we expect earnings per share to be down 2% to 5% versus the prior fiscal year including approximately $0.55 per share of non-core items, mainly $0.20 per of non-core restructuring costs and a $0.32 impairment charge. We\u2019re targeting to deliver about 90% free cash flow productivity. We plan to offset additional capital investments with continued working capital improvements. We plan to return this cash to shareowners through dividend payments of about 7 billion and share repurchase in the range of 5 billion to 7 billion. Our guidance is based on mid-October foreign exchange, spot rates. Further significant currency weakness including Venezuela is not anticipated within our guidance range. Our outlook is based on current market growth rates which we\u2019re monitoring closely. We also continue to monitor unrest in several markets in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, and we continue to closely monitor markets like Venezuela and Argentina, where pricing controls, import restrictions and access to dollars present risk. The guidance does not assume any impact from major portfolio moves, including the sale of the Nanfu Battery joint venture. We\u2019ll update guidance for Nanfu one it closes and we\u2019ll update for other transactions as they are decided and completed. There are few things you should keep in mind as you construct your models for the remainder of the year. Our top-line comps are more difficult in the second quarter versus the back of the year. Benefits from new pricing to offset foreign exchange impacts at Venezuela and other markets will build throughout the year. We expect significant top and bottom-line headwinds from foreign exchange in the October-December quarter. At current FX rates, we will annualize a portion of the FX headwinds in the back half and productivity savings will build as the year progresses. We look forward to talking with you more about our strategies, plans and progress, and engaging with you on your questions at our Analyst Meeting here in Cincinnati on November 12th and 13th. That concludes our prepared remarks for this morning. As a reminder, business segment information is provided on our press release and will be available in slides which we have posted on our Web site www.pg.com following the call. Now, I\u2019d be happy to take your questions. Question: and: Operator : (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Olivia Tong from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Olivia Tong : Thank you. Good morning, Jon. You walked through a lot of new innovation in your prepared remarks and it\u2019s notable considering that this is the first time in a few years that mix has actually contributed to top-line growth, but meanwhile volume continues to be flattish again, so perhaps can you talk through how you think about the contributors to top-line growth going forward? And then following on that can you tell us what the breakout was in U.S. growth versus emerging markets and given slowing macros can you talk about how growth progressed through the quarter? Thank you very much.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Good morning, Jon. You walked through a lot of new innovation in your prepared remarks and it\u2019s notable considering that this is the first time in a few years that mix has actually contributed to top-line growth, but meanwhile volume continues to be flattish again, so perhaps can you talk through how you think about the contributors to top-line growth going forward? And then following on that can you tell us what the breakout was in U.S. growth versus emerging markets and given slowing macros can you talk about how growth progressed through the quarter? Thank you very much. Jon Moeller : : So that\u2019s kind of without getting really specific how we\u2019re thinking about driving growth forward. And I think it\u2019s important that we just step back a minute in the midst of some of the macro difficulties and reflect on opportunities for growth. Developing markets are still growing mid to high single-digits depending on the market, so while growth rates in our view are 1 to 2 points lower than they were a year ago, there is still a lot of opportunity there. And there are significant opportunities in developed markets. It\u2019s very early but we\u2019re starting to see a little bit of uptick in the market growth rates in North America, presumably driven by lower unemployment, wage rates just beginning to increase and lower gasoline prices and hopefully that continues. But even if that doesn\u2019t, there are still significant opportunities for growth in developed markets. Just one example, think about the Asian demographic there are 10,000 Americans everyday crossing the 65 years old line and we talked in our prepared remarks about the adult incontinence opportunity. The tooth sensitivity opportunity with Crest Sensi-Stop Strips is also should benefit from that demographic shift and even things like Tide PODS which are more convenient from a carrying and handling standpoint for older body\u2019s enhance, will help us benefit from that demographic change. So we continue to be very aware of the challenges we face but very hopeful about the opportunities that are in front of us. In terms of the split developed and developing, both North America and developed market\u2019s total were essentially flat on the quarter in terms of organic sales growth with developing up 4%. : So that\u2019s kind of without getting really specific how we\u2019re thinking about driving growth forward.

Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : Gross margin performance clearly improved in the quarter it was up for the first in a year and a half year-over-year. And I am guessing it was probably better or ahead of what you guys expected. Can you discuss the key drivers behind that in terms of the sequential gross margin improvement? And if you think that\u2019s sustainable going forward. And then also just wanted to get an update on the drag you are experiencing from emerging markets growth in terms of gross margin mix, and the progress you expect to make in emerging markets over the next couple of years on gross margins with more localized manufacturing? Morgan Stanley : Gross margin performance clearly improved in the quarter it was up for the first in a year and a half year-over-year. And I am guessing it was probably better or ahead of what you guys expected. Can you discuss the key drivers behind that in terms of the sequential gross margin improvement? And if you think that\u2019s sustainable going forward. And then also just wanted to get an update on the drag you are experiencing from emerging markets growth in terms of gross margin mix, and the progress you expect to make in emerging markets over the next couple of years on gross margins with more localized manufacturing? Jon Moeller :  The biggest driver as you would expect of the gross margin improvement was the productivity savings, which were about 140 basis points. There was also less difference if you will between developing market growth rates and developed market growth rates. So part of the answer going forward depends on that dynamic. And there was also an offset from foreign exchange. So the dynamics going forward also depend on that dynamic. We continue to focus on improving the profitability in developing markets, so that growth there becomes less of a gross margin drag. If you look the last two years and then what we are projecting this year, two years ago we grew constant currency profits in developing markets 2 times faster than sales. Last year we grew them 4 times faster than sales. This year we are forecasting again to be about double the rate of sales growth. So we are very intentional and very deliberate in our efforts to improve developing market margins to a point where they are not as much of a drag on mix. But we are very happy with the gross margin performance. We delivered I think on a fiscal year basis while we will continue to be volatile by quarter. We should continue to see progress. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citigroup. Wendy Nicholson : When you announced in August that you were going through this portfolio rationalization process, you said that you wouldn\u2019t be selling billion dollar brands basically and yet now we are getting the divestiture of the spin of Duracell. So my question is, does the target for the 10% number of sales that you are going to be exiting now go up to kind of 12% to 13% when you include Duracell or has there been some change in how you build off to that 10? Thanks.  Citigroup: When you announced in August that you were going through this portfolio rationalization process, you said that you wouldn\u2019t be selling billion dollar brands basically and yet now we are getting the divestiture of the spin of Duracell. So my question is, does the target for the 10% number of sales that you are going to be exiting now go up to kind of 12% to 13% when you include Duracell or has there been some change in how you build off to that 10? Thanks. Jon Moeller :  You are right Wendy in referring to the Pareto of brands that we talked about that we have been re-divesting and we said there were many that were much smaller than they were those that were bigger. But we didn\u2019t say that there wouldn\u2019t be any large ones, if we did that was a misstatement. But in terms of taking the number up, no this is part of the plan and as I said we are about 25% of the way through the plan through the end of the quarter this is additive to that. So we continue to make progress against that originally articulated plan. There will be some larger businesses but the majority will be small. And I apologize if we miss-communicated that previously. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Michael Stipe with Credit Suisse. Michael Stipe : Just following on Duracell, why even though you have taken a decision to exit this business now, is it still included in the ongoing operations? And then related to that, at what point you are going to sort of tell us what level of operating profit you are essentially loosing by exiting that business? And then secondly, are there significant stranded overhead costs that you are expecting in that disposal process? Credit Suisse : Just following on Duracell, why even though you have taken a decision to exit this business now, is it still included in the ongoing operations? And then related to that, at what point you are going to sort of tell us what level of operating profit you are essentially loosing by exiting that business? And then secondly, are there significant stranded overhead costs that you are expecting in that disposal process? Jon Moeller :  U.S. GAAP accounting requirements require that we account for something in a split-off context in continuing operations until a split-off is executed. And that\u2019s why it remains in continuing operations. But as we execute the split-off or as we were to sign any other agreement the business would move into discontinued operations at that time. In terms of stranded overhead there is some overhead that this business is absorbing. As we talked in the last quarter we are going to do our best to offset that to help minimize dilution. And in terms of what the dilution will ultimately be, it\u2019s really too early to give you helpful guidance on that, because a lot of that\u2019s going to depend on what form the transaction ultimately takes. It will depend on the amount of shares that are exchanged and that exchange ratio which won\u2019t be said until closer to the transaction itself. So we will try to keep you updated as we have information. But right now it would be a pretty wide range. But again I think the takeaway is that we are committed both through the form of the transaction and through our efforts to reduce standard overhead to minimize that dilution number. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Bill Chappell : Jon can you talk a little bit more about the kind of the commodity basket and what you see over the next remainder of fiscal \u201915 and clearly with oil coming down and diesel trades other than should be a tailwind, but you kind of allude to there are some other headwinds so just trying to see what\u2019s you\u2019re seeing and what the next inflation will be this year? SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Jon can you talk a little bit more about the kind of the commodity basket and what you see over the next remainder of fiscal \u201915 and clearly with oil coming down and diesel trades other than should be a tailwind, but you kind of allude to there are some other headwinds so just trying to see what\u2019s you\u2019re seeing and what the next inflation will be this year? Jon Moeller : Yes, we\u2019re certainly hopeful that this becomes a tailwind overtime, but it takes awhile for instance crude reductions to work their way through the refineries and there is a bit of a bottleneck right now in refining capacity in parts of the world, which is why we\u2019re not seeing the immediate flow through into our commodity cost base. So our commodities currently are about a 2 to 3 point headwind versus last year and we\u2019re seeing some moderation in a small decline for instance in diesel prices and hopefully that continues, but we still have resins and polypropylenes due to the dynamic I mentioned earlier, up fairly significantly versus year ago. So hopefully that 2 to 3 point headwind is a worse case number and hopefully we get some help as things continue to evolve. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Faucher with JPMorgan. John Faucher : Two quick questions, well one quick one probably a little bit longer. First off can you talk a little bit about the sustainability of the working capital improvement that you saw this quarter, there was a nice benefit year-over-year? And then the second question relates to the mix from a margin standpoint obviously it was better this quarter because emerging markets got worse let\u2019s say, you know, but can you talk about some of the margin improvements you can make outside the U.S. and outside of developed markets that will create a little less margin pressure particularly on the operating profit line as we look out over the next couple of years? Thanks.  JPMorgan: Two quick questions, well one quick one probably a little bit longer. First off can you talk a little bit about the sustainability of the working capital improvement that you saw this quarter, there was a nice benefit year-over-year? And then the second question relates to the mix from a margin standpoint obviously it was better this quarter because emerging markets got worse let\u2019s say, you know, but can you talk about some of the margin improvements you can make outside the U.S. and outside of developed markets that will create a little less margin pressure particularly on the operating profit line as we look out over the next couple of years? Thanks. Jon Moeller : Thanks John. On the sustainability of working capital improvement side, I view them as very sustainable. Cash is one of our clear focus areas and we have some strong plans that are continuing to make progress. The progress that we made in the quarter that we just reported was driven primarily by the supply chain financing program which has future benefits associated with it. We\u2019re not all of our way through that yet and those benefits are sustainable going forward. On top of that, as we execute our portfolio focusing program, there is a significant opportunity that we\u2019re committed to go after once we have rationalized the category and brand portfolio at the skew level and that also presents a significant inventory and working capital opportunity the bottom 5% of our skews in terms of movement not surprisingly account for a much greater percentage of our inventory, so as we get after that, there should be a benefit. And third as I mentioned in our supply chain redesign efforts, we\u2019re hopeful we can take significant levels of inventory out of the total system and at the same time decrease shelf out-of-stocks, improve customer service. So there are a number of big drivers that we should have available to us to continue to make progress in that area, which we\u2019re committed to do impart to offset the impact of some of the capital spending that we\u2019re doing in the supply chain redesign on a global basis. In terms of what we can do in developing markets to reduce the margin mix impact, as I mentioned in an answer to a prior question, we\u2019re making significant progress in this area on a constant currency basis. 2x the rate of organic sales growth, two years ago 4x last year at least 2x again this year, also some of the developing market investments that we made for instance the Oral Care investments, those are beginning to accrete and that should be a source of help going forward. The productivity savings are not simply a developed market dynamic. They are equally a developing market dynamic on items like TDC, items like marketing even in the non-manufacturing overhead arena. And then as you know we\u2019re also increasingly localizing our production. We\u2019ll be bringing some of the same redesign to parts of the developing world that we\u2019re doing in the developed world today at least from a distribution center standpoint. And so I see no reason why longer term developing markets margin should be a significant drag on earning though they will continue to be a negative drag in the near-term. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo. Chris Ferrara : Jon, I guess, can you talk a little bit about beauty, I guess in particular can you go through Pantene U.S. which the scanner data looks a little better recently and then also Olay U.S. your skincare in general U.S. skincare in China? And then I guess maybe elaborate on the Prestige comments you made in the press release that\u2019d be great? Wells Fargo Securities : Jon, I guess, can you talk a little bit about beauty, I guess in particular can you go through Pantene U.S. which the scanner data looks a little better recently and then also Olay U.S. your skincare in general U.S. skincare in China? And then I guess maybe elaborate on the Prestige comments you made in the press release that\u2019d be great? Jon Moeller : So if you look at beauty parts of that business are doing a fairly well. We grew antiperspirant and deodorant mid single-digits, cosmetics grew organic sales mid single-digits in the quarter with Max Factor growing shipments on a double-digit basis globally. Safeguard was growing mid single-digits globally with double-digit growth in parts of the developing world. And we had a pretty strong quarter on Hugo Boss which is largest Prestige fragrance. Hair Care grew about 2% in the quarter. We were very encouraged by the developments that you point out on Pantene in the U.S. where volume was up 11% on the quarter. As I have cautioned before this will be not be a straight line and competitive intensity in this category is significant, but still forward progress is encouraging. Olay remains work in progress. We are making some good progress in addressing some of the consumer benefit segments that we had neglected and that are important in the category with items like Luminous with the items like Fresh Effects. But we still have work to do both in North America and in China. But sequentially quarter-on-quarter better results in beauty from a top-line standpoint and we are hopeful we can continue that. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank. Bill Schmitz : A couple of questions, just to sort of drill down more in the U.S. can you just talk about some of the price interventions you discussed last quarter if they are done yet and kind of where they happened. And then some of the personnel changes in the U.S. and your views on the sustainability of the U.S. recovery. I know it\u2019s like very nascent but curious why you think things are improving and then maybe how long you think it will last? And then lastly just urgency on some of the share losses in China and if you saw any material distributor destocking in any of the major emerging markets? Sorry for the long question.

And then lastly just urgency on some of the share losses in China and if you saw any material distributor destocking in any of the major emerging markets? Sorry for the long question. Jon Moeller :  Obviously pricing is a sensitive topic, so I don\u2019t want to get into really granular specifics. But we did mention that we had made value equation interventions in both the laundry and the paper products businesses specifically tissue towel and toilet paper. And those appear to have been going pretty well. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks we have built share on a almost in a period of time you can look at it in the last 52 weeks on both Gain and Tide. Tide was up 2 points in the quarter. And so we will continue. We need to be competitive on pricing, we will continue to be competitive. But I think we are pretty much where we need to be. I don\u2019t see, of course this changes on a daily basis. But as we sit here today, I don\u2019t see any additional significant moves that need to be made. In terms of personnel, look we are just taking advantage of normal retirement and normal attrition to design the organization that\u2019s going to lead this more focused more strategically-oriented company for a balanced growth and value creation. And that\u2019s what we are doing. We are going to have a management team that\u2019s going to manage this company that would be the same size as the team that existed in 2000 managing a company that\u2019s 2x or actually more than 2x the size of the company in 2000. And that\u2019s the design intent. In terms of China, China continues to be an attractive market in our view it\u2019s market where we\u2019ve grown over 50% in the last four years. Market growth continues, the last quarter based on our look at our categories market growth was up was about 6%. Our inventories are pretty much inline throughout the trade chain. So we really have not I would view those destocking dynamics as company specific rather than systemic. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with UBS. Steve Powers : I was hoping maybe just to step back and put this quarter in a better context of all the improvement efforts that you are doing, clearly there is lots of things that you have done internally over the 12 months that you summarized and that you view as positive in the re-org the supply chain restructuring. Overall productivity focus you build the brand refocusing initiative et cetera. I think all that\u2019s good. But despite that and despite the innovation successes and the brand strength that you ran through organic growth is still only rounding up to 2%. Only two of the divisions grew this quarter. And I guess that improved focus overtime an easier compares going forward should help but even many of the core brands you attempt to retain remain pretty sluggish and have been so for some time. So I guess in that context what are you planning to do to change that paradigm. Is it truly all about the better execution that you mentioned or they are things that consumers currently want from P&G in certain areas that you are not delivering? Because I am trying to discern how much you can do to reaccelerate growth on your own versus how much such improvement is just more dependent on macro improvement? Thanks.  UBS: I was hoping maybe just to step back and put this quarter in a better context of all the improvement efforts that you are doing, clearly there is lots of things that you have done internally over the 12 months that you summarized and that you view as positive in the re-org the supply chain restructuring.

Because I am trying to discern how much you can do to reaccelerate growth on your own versus how much such improvement is just more dependent on macro improvement? Thanks. Jon Moeller :  There is a lot that we can do on our own. And that\u2019s why I talked about the whole brand building and selling execution opportunity, that\u2019s completely within our control. And I mentioned the sampling opportunities. We have opportunities to continue to improve the quality and clarity of our communication with consumers. We have significant opportunities which the supply chain redesign will help us address at the first moment of truth just in terms of out-of-stocks. And generally while market growths have slowed, consumers continue to be very responsive to innovation that increases the value of the product that they are purchasing. If we\u2019d look at the segments of our business that are growing the fastest, and I\u2019ve talked about some of them in the opening remarks, many of those are premium priced items but come with product superiority and consumer benefit that more than justifies that price. And put simply, we believe that the antidote to relatively slow overall market sales or market growth is threefold, it\u2019s innovation, it\u2019s productivity, and it\u2019s execution. And I would be remised if I didn't mention in this context that to the point of the prior question we still have work to do on our beauty business and on couple of other pockets of the business, and that should also as we improve that make a significant different in our ability to grow not just at but ahead of -- slightly ahead of market growth rates. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays Capital. Lauren Lieberman : May be just buck up on that a bit and let\u2019s maybe focus on grooming because when you talk about some of the sampling opportunities some of them sounded familiar like things you\u2019ve always done, the babies in the hospital get Pampers, you\u2019ve got incredible reach there, sending razors to boys when they turn 18, that dynamic so that\u2019s not necessarily new, so we focus a bit on grooming, right, that\u2019s the trial opportunity. You had massive innovation with FlexBall, you gave some really positive statistics on the impact on the market yet few organic sales growth of the business was flat and it was all pricing and volume was down, so just maybe focus on a particular business what was missing, if FlexBall has been so successful thus far what\u2019s missing that these numbers are numbers still so weak? Thanks.

Thanks. Jon Moeller : Well I think there and it\u2019s very early and you can imagine that most men have an inventory of blades at home that they have to work through before the real driver of growth in that market which is cartridge consumption takes place, but we\u2019re beginning to see an increase now in cartridge market share. We\u2019re up about 1.4 points in the quarter. We\u2019re also beginning to see a reduction in the rate of market decline in the grooming segment. It was down as much as 6% to 7%. Previously, it\u2019s down about 3% on a more recent basis and as low as past 1% in a couple of the recent months. And remember as well that the FlexBall innovation is not only new to market it\u2019s only in one country serving one gender. And as I mentioned in my remarks, we\u2019ll begin globalizing this over the balance of, starting in calendar year 2015. We\u2019ll bring the truly superior benefit of this product to women as well, and so we\u2019re early days in that whole dynamic. Also remember that when we sell an initiative which we did with FlexBall in the last quarter, there is an inherent acceleration of sales into the quarter as we work to stock the shelves and fill the supply chain. So grooming organic growth last quarter was 7%. If you look at it on a two quarter average basis, which I think is a more representative way to look at it given the initiative dynamics it\u2019s in pretty good shape. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital. Connie Maneaty : How many more businesses are there in your portfolio like the one in China that led to almost billion dollar non-cash impairment charge? BMO Capital Markets : How many more businesses are there in your portfolio like the one in China that led to almost billion dollar non-cash impairment charge? Jon Moeller : As you can imagine, we do impairment testing on a routine basis. We disclosed in our last K that that there was some risk on the Duracell evaluation that we had very cushion. And then the selling price that we generated and the impacts of decision to sell, which frankly changed some of the impairment testing criteria led to that impairment. You will notice in our disclosures that there are no other businesses that we\u2019re disclosing a similar risk on it doesn\u2019t mean there will never be one, but as we sit here today actually that is very low risk. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Nik Modi : So I just wanted to tack onto Bill Schmitz\u2019s question regarding the personnel changes, and if you could just talk about just along two vectors, one is just near-term disruption and how we should be thinking about that as you have new folks kind of getting into new roles and getting up the learning curve? And then the second question is as you streamline P&G\u2019s decision makers and operating model, have you thought about changing incentive structures and anyway, shape or form just to kind of get people focused on the right behaviors and the right geographies and the right product categories? Thanks.  RBC Capital Markets : So I just wanted to tack onto Bill Schmitz\u2019s question regarding the personnel changes, and if you could just talk about just along two vectors, one is just near-term disruption and how we should be thinking about that as you have new folks kind of getting into new roles and getting up the learning curve?

Thanks. Jon Moeller : So I am not terribly concerned about near-term disruption. I think it\u2019s a fair question Nick, but there are many more people continuing to do their jobs and people changing jobs. And the people that are changing jobs are better and experienced pros in almost every case. So it\u2019s something that we need to stay deliberate and intentional on, not dropping any balls. But I am really that concerned about that. Again it\u2019s, I meant no way to dismiss the question I think it\u2019s a very fair question. But I think we are in a good shape. In terms of rewards and incentives that\u2019s something that we are always looking at, that\u2019s something that the Compensation Committee at the Board is always looking at. I don\u2019t have a specific change to announce today, but it\u2019s something that continues to receive the appropriate levels of attention. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English :  I would like to circle back on an earlier question on beauty. Specifically Prestige I don\u2019t think I heard you discuss the drivers of weakness there. And I was hopeful you could elaborate. And then more broadly based on your 10-K disclosures this has been a business with pretty inconsistent performance in the past and obviously it serves a non-core retail customer for you. So in that context can you walk us through the rational and maybe the puts and takes of why either should or shouldn\u2019t be considered in your portfolio rationalization initiatives? Goldman Sachs :  I would like to circle back on an earlier question on beauty. Specifically Prestige I don\u2019t think I heard you discuss the drivers of weakness there. And I was hopeful you could elaborate.

So in that context can you walk us through the rational and maybe the puts and takes of why either should or shouldn\u2019t be considered in your portfolio rationalization initiatives? Jon Moeller :  Thanks for re-asking the question on the trends in the quarter. Jason I appreciate that I, Bill asked such a long question I\u2019d forgotten that part. And that is not a dig on you Bill. The biggest driver frankly is a base period dynamic where we had a strong innovation on both Gucci and Lacoste in the year ago quarter and there was less of that this quarter. As you can understand maybe not appreciate, I really don\u2019t want to spend a lot of time talking about specific businesses and their role in the portfolio as we are going through all that changes that we are going through. We will announce moves and decisions as they occur and we will try to be very clear as to what the rationale is. And I will leave it there. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research. Javier Escalante : Jon a question on the savings and your decision of having double-digit earnings growth in this environment, okay currency neutral, could you tell us how much savings you striked at this quarter. And remind us what is the target for the year? And to what extent there is reinvestment allocated in these double-digit earnings growth target at this stage of the turnaround. My peers are alluding to the very low top-line growth the 2%? Okay, thank you.  Consumer Edge Research : Jon a question on the savings and your decision of having double-digit earnings growth in this environment, okay currency neutral, could you tell us how much savings you striked at this quarter. And remind us what is the target for the year? And to what extent there is reinvestment allocated in these double-digit earnings growth target at this stage of the turnaround. My peers are alluding to the very low top-line growth the 2%? Okay, thank you. Jon Moeller :  Thank you, Javier. In the quarter there were about 250 basis points of savings across cost of goods and SG&A. And a not insignificant portion of that was reinvested. I talked about the investment levels that we have increased behind Tide when we have strong innovation. We are going to invest behind it. We did the same on Pampers and have continued spending to drive that business increase consumer awareness, increase household penetration. I also mentioned that I didn\u2019t give it a lot of time so I understand how we could have crossed over it. But we are being very intentional in reinvesting in two areas. One in the SRA area, one is in R&D to bring even more innovation to market that\u2019s more relevant for consumers and it improves realize in an even stronger way and in our selling execution assuring that we have got sufficient channel coverage in the channels that are growing in that matter ensuring that we have an appropriate level of category knowledge and dedication. So we will reinvest when there are good opportunities and which we feel we can drive a strong return. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan, from Stifel. Mark Astrachan :  I wanted to follow-up on an earlier question on beauty and Prestige in particular. Curious about the recently announced decision to consolidate leadership of the salon and global Prestige units under one person, is there a change to how the company is thinking about managing one or both of those units? And then also just quickly anything to read into in the change in the name of that beauty hair and now personal care segment from beauty previously? Stifel Nicolaus :  I wanted to follow-up on an earlier question on beauty and Prestige in particular. Curious about the recently announced decision to consolidate leadership of the salon and global Prestige units under one person, is there a change to how the company is thinking about managing one or both of those units? And then also just quickly anything to read into in the change in the name of that beauty hair and now personal care segment from beauty previously? Jon Moeller :  I am not in any way trying to back hand the answer to that question. But there is really not a lot of significance in either of those. This is Patrice Louvet that you are referring to will be managing those three businesses. He has a strong track-record within the Company. He has managed our fragrance business our Prestige business previously. And he is going to be great going forward. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Alice Longley with Buckingham Research. Alice Longley : Hi good morning. My question is about what you think your category growth rate was globally in the quarter. I am trying to figure out if you gained or lost share in this quarter? And then are still holding the category growth rate of 2% to 3% for fiscal \u201915? And has there been any change in your outlook for category growth rate in the U.S. versus emerging regions for this year? Thank you. Buckingham Research : Hi good morning. My question is about what you think your category growth rate was globally in the quarter. I am trying to figure out if you gained or lost share in this quarter? And then are still holding the category growth rate of 2% to 3% for fiscal \u201915? And has there been any change in your outlook for category growth rate in the U.S. versus emerging regions for this year? Thank you. Jon Moeller : Okay, so overall category growth rate was 2.5% and that\u2019s kind what we\u2019re expecting. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we\u2019re basing our guidance on the current market growth rates we see which are those. I also mention that we are -- sorry I might have not mentioned, but we\u2019re seeing a slight uptick in growth rates in North America which is encouraging. We\u2019re talking share fairly modest and as I have said in other calls, this is tended to be choppy in the past so it\u2019s up one quarter down the next, we\u2019ll see, but that\u2019s a reason to have a degree of hope there. And in terms of where we\u2019re gaining and losing share, generally we\u2019re doing we\u2019re about flat in North America, we\u2019re up a little bit in Europe, we\u2019re down a little bit in a couple of the developing markets and that gets you back to even. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy with CLSA. Caroline Levy : This goes to both Olay and the Baby Care business and you had mentioned you\u2019re looking how to improve your selling execution in the face of new channel development, so in China in particular the explosion of online sales and mummy stores, beauty shops just could you dive into a little deeper how much that has disrupted the business in China, in particular if I look at Baby I think you had flat volume in the quarter and yet you did very well in the U.S. in Baby, so that would be helpful? Thank you.  CLSA: This goes to both Olay and the Baby Care business and you had mentioned you\u2019re looking how to improve your selling execution in the face of new channel development, so in China in particular the explosion of online sales and mummy stores, beauty shops just could you dive into a little deeper how much that has disrupted the business in China, in particular if I look at Baby I think you had flat volume in the quarter and yet you did very well in the U.S. in Baby, so that would be helpful? Thank you. Jon Moeller : First of all those the channels that you mentioned are very relevant channels and they\u2019re growing very quickly and we have as you can imagine deliberate efforts to participate in that growth. Also e-commerce is growing very-very quickly in China it\u2019s about 40% of the growth in the market and we\u2019re very well represented there as well. In terms of the difference between Baby share development in the U.S. and China, first of all we remain by a wide margin the market leader in Baby Care in China. The competitive sets are different between China and the U.S. and as a result, you would expect some different dynamics. But we continue to be very encouraged about the business in both areas and that\u2019s really what I have to say. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj : So I wanted to get a better understanding of where you think you are versus plan in the turnaround the day you came back. And I think about it along the three dimensions at least one is productivity and I guess I am reacting a little bit to about a fifth of your productivity coming from advertising spend, basis point basis adverting spend this quarter, so one is advertising spend? Two is the pace of divestitures of Duracell happening here very shortly after you said you\u2019re going to do something should we expect as fast or a fast pace for larger divestures like this? And then third is something folks have referred to little bit which is two of your five segments are really driving your growth, now I want to understand within that how much of that is kind of less sensitivity of those particular segments to the macro environment and how of that is actually execution actually innovation actually things you are doing? And so that\u2019s the core question, I just have two follow-up clarity questions on some other things, one is what would your growth have been in beauty without the volumes in Prestige being an issue and what would have your growth have been without Duracell in the Battery segment? Thank you. Sanford Bernstein : So I wanted to get a better understanding of where you think you are versus plan in the turnaround the day you came back.

Thank you. Jon Moeller : In terms of where we are, in innings if you will in the execution of the plan, I think we\u2019re in some of the early innings. I think there is a significant. I know that there is a significant productivity opportunity that still stands in front of us. We\u2019ve talked about the redesign of the supply chains. We\u2019ve talked about the portfolio focus which will give us more opportunity to get even more efficient in our overhead approach. So I think there is -- we will accelerate and we\u2019ll exceed the 10 billion and we won\u2019t stop there. I\u2019d see this being characteristic of our opportunities and environment that we\u2019re operating in for the foreseeable future. In terms of the advertising question within that we have tried to say many times, most of the reduction that\u2019s occurring is in non-media spending. And of the 50 basis points that we referenced in our prepared remarks, 40 basis points of that was non-advertising marketing spending. So it\u2019s lower product cost, it\u2019s lower talent cost, it\u2019s more efficient operation, it\u2019s not less advertising and reaching consumers or in any way less effective advertising in reaching consumers. Our objective here is to continue to strengthen the impact of our marketing and advertising efforts while reducing cost that don\u2019t matter to consumers. In terms of the pace of divestitures as we said as AG said in the call last quarter and as I mentioned today, we will do this over an 18 to 24 month period. Quite frankly we are not going to be time-driven we are going to be value-driven. And so it\u2019s hard for me to sit here today and say exactly how long it will take. But we will continue to pursue that at pace. We\u2019d obviously like to get there as soon as it\u2019s practical, but don\u2019t want to compromise value by focusing overly on timing versus quality of execution. And honestly relative to the last part of the question, I think it\u2019s very hard to look at one quarters of results and come to a big conclusion about what\u2019s driving anything. So I would encourage us to kind of take those segment results over a period of three or four quarters to get a better feel for what\u2019s going on. Operator :  Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

Bernstein Jon Andersen - William Blair Operator : Welcome to Procter & Gamble's quarter-end conference call. Today's discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections. As required by Regulation G, P&G needs to make you aware that during the call the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Management believes these measures provide investors valuable information on the underlying growth trends of the business. Organic refers to reported results excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange where applicable. Adjusted free cash flow represents operating cash flow, less capital expenditures and excluding tax payments for the pet care divestiture. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings adjusted for impairment charges. Any measure described as core refers to the equivalent GAAP measure adjusted for certain items. Currency neutral refers to the equivalent GAAP measure excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate changes. P&G has posted on its website, www.pg.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP and other financial measures. Now I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller. Jon Moeller : October and December was another challenging quarter from a macro standpoint with significant foreign exchange headwinds, modest market growth and continued political and economic volatility. Against this backdrop, we were able to deliver organic top line growth and currency neutral core earnings growth that were in-line with our going in expectations. Organic sales grew 2% in 4 or 5 business segments, Baby, Feminine and Family Care, Grooming, Healthcare and Fabric and Home Care reported growth versus the prior year. Top line growth trends improved as we move sequentially through the quarter finishing with mid-single digit organic sales growth in December. Organic volume was in-line with the prior year. Organic volume was up one point in developed markets; developing market volume was down slightly as we took pricing to offset foreign exchange devaluation across several countries. Pricing and mix each added a point to sales growth. Overall, we held or grew worldwide share on businesses representing about half of company sales and about 60% of sales in the home U.S. market. We continue to grow share in Latin America and held share in Europe and India, Middle East and Africa. We lost some share in Asia, principally in China and Japan. As we reported at the analyst meeting in November, we're growing share on more of our category leading brands in countries where it matters most, Pampers, Tide, Gillette and Pantene in the United States for example. We have opportunities on other important businesses like Family Care in the U.S. and in countries like China. On a constant currency basis, core [inaudible] share were up 6%, in-line with our expectations keeping us on track for double-digit constant currency core earnings per share growth for the fiscal year. Virtually every currency in the world devalued versus the dollar with the Russian ruble leading the way. While we continue to make steady progress on strategic business and company brand and product initiatives and continue to increase and accelerate productivity savings, the progress has not been sufficient enough to offset FX. All-in sales were down 4% versus the prior year including a 5 point headwind from foreign exchange and a 1 point reduction from minor brand divestitures. Including FX which was a 14 percentage-point drag on the quarter, core earnings per share were $1.06 down 8% versus the prior year. Given the magnitude of the impact, I thought it might be helpful to briefly recount how FX impacts reported results. I'll use the example of the ruble which depreciated 53% versus the dollar during the quarter and was down 78% for the first half of the fiscal year. The declining ruble impacts reported earnings in three ways for a total fiscal year hurt of about $550 million after-tax. Here are the building blocks and how they break down. First, transaction impacts increased the cost of non-ruble denominated inputs. We import as an example Gillette blades and razors into Russia from Germany. Widening of the cross-rate between the euro and the ruble increases the Russian units cost of razors and reduces profit. Similarly, the local cost of plastic bottles which are denominated in euros and imported into Russia for the production of Fabric Care and Hair Care products have increased significantly. This transaction cost impact affects all manufacturers, multi-national and local, whose materials or finished products are imported from similar sources and are similarly denominated. We attempt to recover these cost increases through pricing when local legal requirements and market realities allow it though there is a lag between the time the currency devalues, the costs are incurred and the pricing is taken and executed through our channels of distribution. Second, we need to revalue transaction related foreign currency working capital balances. This includes the revaluation of working capital balances related to transactions between P&G legal entities that operate in different currencies. To continue the prior example while razors produced in Germany are being transported and are moving through the customs process into Russia, our Russian books hold a euro-denominated payable. At the end of every quarter, working capital balances are revalued at current spot rates. Gains or losses from revaluing transactional working capital balances typically flow through SG&A and are included in core earnings per share. The only exception is the case of a fixed exchange rate currency that is also hyperinflationary. In this case, we need to revalue not just the foreign currency transactional balances, but also the local currency working capital balances. All of these impacts are reported in non-core earnings. The Venezuelan bolivar is the only currency that currently fits this definition. Third, income statements of foreign subsidiaries like Russia that did not use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency are translated back to U.S. dollars at new exchange rates. Just the Russian ruble transaction, balance sheet revaluation and translation impacts have been and are projected to be significant at about $150 million, $100 million and $300 million after-tax, respectively for a total as I said earlier, of $550 million after-tax for the year. Across all currencies, foreign exchange hurts totaled $450 million after-tax in the December quarter, $650 million fiscal year-to-date and are forecast to be at $1.4 billion after-tax profit curve [ph] over the course of the fiscal year. This is the most significant fiscal year currency impact we have ever incurred. The currencies of six countries, Russia, the Ukraine, Venezuela, Argentina, Japan and now Switzerland account for over $1 billion of the $1.4 billion after-tax headwind from FX. In the first five of these markets, we have larger businesses than nearly all of our multi-national competitors and we have a large Swiss franc exposure from our European headquarters in Geneva. In aggregate we have more than $8.8 billion of sales in these markets, 2 to 3 times our next largest competitor. Of the $1.4 billion hurt, about 30% is from transaction, about 20% is from balance sheet revaluation and the remaining 50% is from translation, because of these impacts the outlook for the fiscal year will remain challenging. We have and will continue to offset as much of this currency impact as we can through pricing and productivity cost savings. At the same time, we will continue to invest in our businesses, brands, product innovation and capabilities because it's the right thing to do for the mid and long term. We'll adjust fiscal year targets accordingly as I'll cover when we get to guidance. Now as these FX impacts flow through the income statement they obviously impact margins. Core gross margin was down 20 basis points in the December quarter, excluding foreign exchange it was up 40 basis points. Cost savings of approximately 190 basis points and 60 basis points of improvement from higher pricing were offset by 110 basis points of mix, 50 points from innovation and capacity investments and 50 basis points from commodity cost increases. While we're beginning to benefit from lower fuel prices which reduced transportation costs, the costs of materials such as resin and other specialty chemicals were still higher in the December quarter than in the prior year. Pulp is also up year-on-year. If oil stays at or around current levels, these material costs headwinds should turn to tailwinds by the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. Core SG&A costs as a percentage of sales increased about 30 basis points excluding FX they were down 80 basis points. 70 basis points of overhead savings and 70 basis points of marketing savings mainly from non-media cost efficiencies were more than offset by 120 basis points of foreign exchange impact and 50 basis points of organizational capability investments in R&D and sales. Productivity savings and cost of goods sold and SG&A totaled 330 basis points as we continue to meet or beat all of our productivity objectives. Core operating margin was down 60 basis points versus the prior year including FX and was up 120 basis points excluding FX. The effective tax rate on core earnings was 22.3%, 130 basis points above last year's rate. This keeps us on track with our fiscal year outlook of about 21%. December quarter all-in GAAP earnings per share were $0.82 which include approximately $0.03 per share of non-core restructuring charges and a $0.06 per share benefit from earnings of the discontinued batteries and pet care operations. Also included was a $0.26 per share one-time, non-core, non-cash charge as we explained during our analyst day in November to adjust the carrying value of the battery business. It was a strong cash quarter, we generated $3.4 billion in operating cash flow and $3 billion in adjusted free cash flow with 95% adjusted free cash flow productivity. We returned $3.7 billion of cash to shareholders, $1.8 billion in dividends and $1.9 billion in share repurchase. Fiscal year-to-date we have returned $7.9 billion to shareholders, $3.6 billion in dividends and $4.3 billion in share repurchase. In summary, second quarter organic sales and constant currency core earnings growth were in-line with going-in expectations. Productivity savings continued at or ahead of plans with constant currency growth and operating margins well ahead of year ago and we continued our strong track record of cash productivity and cash return to shareholders. We're maintaining investments necessary to support our brands and product innovations. These include continuous strategic investment in breakthrough product innovations like Gillette ProGlide Flexball and our entry into the adult incontinence category with Always Discreet as well as investments to restore the competitive value equation of leading brands like Bounty and Charmin. We will strike what we believe to be the appropriate balance between short-term FX cost recovery and investment to support the mid and long term health of our business. We will continue our efforts to focus our portfolio, to lead business model and product innovation to become ever more productive and cost efficient and to execute with excellence. As we announced in August, we're taking a significant and strategic step forward to streamline, simplify and strengthen the company's business and brand portfolio. We will become a simpler, more focused company of 70 to 80 category-leading competitively advantaged brands organized into about a dozen business units in four industry based sectors. We will compete in businesses that are structurally attractive and that play to P&G strengths where we can achieve sustainable advantage. Every brand we plan to keep is strategic with the potential to grow and create value with 70 to 80 brands are leaders in their industries, categories or segments brand shoppers buy, consumers use and customers support. They are leaders in brand equity, awareness, trial, purchase and loyalty. They are leaders in product performance and product innovation and leaders in growth and value creation. Within these brands, we will operate with more efficient brand product line and SKU offerings, reducing SKUs 15% to 20% over the next two years. We will create a faster growing, more profitable company that is far simpler to operate. We have been progressing this work at a healthy pace. In November, we announced plans to exit the Duracell business through a split transaction in which we will exchange a recapitalized Duracell company for Berkshire Hathaway's shares of P&G stock. We expect to complete the deal in the second half of this calendar year. While we're progressing very well, those of you who have built your fiscal 2016 models assuming a July 1st closing and related share count reduction are probably a quarter or two too aggressive. In late December, we closed the divesture of the European pet care business and respective brands. We also signed and communicated a deal to divest Camay and Zest soap brands. To-date we have divested, discontinued or consolidated 35 brands. As we continue to strengthen our category and brand portfolio, we will focus our brand building and product innovation, support and investment against the biggest consumer and market opportunities. We're committed to be or become the brand and product innovation leader in the categories in which we compete. Year-after-year, decade-after-decade successful brand building and product innovation have grown our categories, created entirely new categories, built our business and have been a major source of value creation. Innovation combats commoditization, stimulates category growth and builds the cumulative advantage of our brands over time. Our biggest business by far is Baby Care and the Pampers brand. Our biggest country is the United States. As first reported last month at analyst day, we continue to stimulate category growth at 2% to 3% over the last year, reversing a multi-year decline. The Pampers business model that focuses on stimulating point-of-market entry demand and trade up to mom preferred, better performing and premium-priced products like the unique Swaddlers innovation and better performing better value point-of-entry products from Luvs have resulted in broad and sustainable category growth that benefits retailers, suppliers and manufacturers and has grown share for P&G. Our U.S. diaper share is now 44%, up 2 points versus a year ago. We've turned a 10 point share disadvantage into an 8-point category leadership advantage over the past five years. Both Pampers and Luvs are growing share. Pampers Swaddlers share is up 3 points to an absolute category share of 12%. We're bringing diaper pants to market. We just introduced Pampers Premium Care Pants in Russia where the [inaudible] accounts for 23% of the market. Pampers Pants provide exceptional skin comfort and dryness benefits in an underwear-like design. The Russia launch is off to a very good start with shipments about 50% ahead of target. We'll be bringing Pants to China this month and Latin America next quarter. Achieving a fair share of the global diaper pant market represents up to a $2 billion growth opportunity. Our strategy for Fabric Care in the U.S., our second biggest business, is having a similar positive impact for P&G and for category growth. It begins with creating and delivering a consumer preferred mix of brands, products and values. Nearly a year ago, we introduced a strengthened Fabric Care brand and product lineup that significantly broadened consumer appeal. Essentially, we offered shoppers a full range of brands and products priced from about $0.15 to $0.28 a laundry load, including broadened POD offerings, new and improved liquid detergent options and Tide Simply Clean and Fresh, a preferred brand and product for consumers interested in value at an affordable price. As a result, Tide and Gain have both grown market share over the past 52, 26, 13 and 4-week periods. Tide now holds a 40 share. Gain is the number two brand at a 16 share. PODS have reached an 11 share of the U.S. market and P&G's share of that segment has grown above 80. We're seeing the first indication of category sales stability and even growth in recent weeks which is good for retailers, suppliers and manufacturers. This is the first category growth in seven years. We continue to expand PODS around the world and to developed and developing markets and we expect unit [inaudible] to reach $1.5 billion in retail sales this fiscal year. We're following a similar strategy in the fabric conditioner category, a smaller, but even faster growing core strategic business. The business model stimulates category growth by trading more consumers into the discretionary fabric conditioner product category be a meaningful product like scent beads and liquid products that deliver better, functional and sensory benefits. Beads alone will deliver $400 million in global sales this fiscal year. We continue to grow our Downy and Lenor brands in established markets, while we expand effectively into new countries where the size of the prize and the value creation return are attractive. P&G fabric conditioners are growing at about a 7% compound average growth rate, approaching $3 billion in global sales. We're growing the grooming category and P&G's share behind the Gillette Flexball innovation. The male razor segment is up 17% on a unit volume basis over the last six months. Gillette's razor volume share was up 7% in the December quarter. As expected, we're beginning to see strong razor sales translate into an improved blade or cartridge share which was up 2 points in the December quarter. We're expanding Flexball right now to Europe, the Middle East and Africa and we're extending this breakthrough to women with Venus Swirl which began shipping in the U.S. this month. Women and men are telling us that they significantly prefer these products. It looks like Flexball may be the biggest most consumer-obvious new shaving system innovation ever introduced by Gillette. Our Hair Care business is now growing share in both the U.S. and China. Pantene has now grown share seven months in a row in the U.S. and Head & Shoulders is up about 0.5 point in both markets, both brands are responding to improved products and better brand building. These brands in this category have a full pipeline of product innovation that will come to market this year and in the years ahead. Pantene is shipping its new product line with formulations that work from the inside out to deliver on Pantene's promise of delivering the most beautiful, healthy hair so you shine. Head & Shoulders new product line delivers 100% dandruff free results and an improved in-use experience that enables consumers to feel the product working instantly. We're accelerating the growth of the adult incontinence category with Always Discreet. Women are not fully satisfied with current category product offerings. One in three women over 18 years old suffers from incontinence, but only one in nine uses an incontinence product. Always Discreet pad and pant-style offerings deliver significantly better fit and protection from Always, a brand that women trust and prefer. We begin shipments of Always Discreet in the UK in July and the U.S., Canada and France in August. In the UK, the adult incontinence category is growing double digits, roughly 50% faster since our entry. In the U.S., the category growth rate has more than doubled to around 9% and our shipments are running ahead of target in both markets with value share a little over 7% in each. We're continuing the expansion of Always Discreet with launches in Germany, Switzerland and Austria this quarter. We're committed to be the innovation leader in our categories, to drive category growth and the growth of our businesses. And we're increasing investment where we have consumer preferred brands and products. In addition to innovation, productivity will continue to drive total shareholder return. The best companies in any industry find a way to lead both innovation and productivity. We're turning productivity into a core strength at P&G making it a systemic, enduring value creation pillar alongside innovation. We have significantly accelerated and will significantly exceed the $10 billion cost savings goal we set 2.5 years ago. We're driving cost of goods savings well above the original target run-rate of $1.2 billion a year, with $1.6 billion of savings this fiscal year. We expect to improve manufacturing productivity by at least 6% again this year, reducing staffing even as we add capacity and start up new production modules. We've begun work on what is probably the biggest supply chain redesign in the company's history. We're transforming our distribution network in the United States, consolidating customer shipments into fewer distribution centers. These centers are strategically located closer to key customers in key population centers, enabling 80% of the business to be within one day of the store shelf and the shopper. All six of the new mixing centers will be operational by the end of February, on or ahead of schedule and we expect to complete the conversion out of legacy locations this calendar year. The distribution network projects will allow both P&G and our retail partners to optimize inventory levels, while still improving service and on-shelf availability and reducing in-store out of stocks. We have established a $1 billion to $2 billion value creation target from the global supply chain reinvention effort. We're targeting to deliver $400 million to $600 million in annual cost savings building to this level over the next three to five years. These savings are incremental to the $6 billion of cost of goods savings we originally communicated and are on track to exceed. We expect additional top and bottom-line benefits from improved service levels. We continue to invest strategically in additional capacity for critical developing markets and we continue to rationalize our manufacturing processes so that common, simpler and more global standard making and packing platforms support accelerated product innovation at lower cash, capital and operating costs. This enables not only better and cheaper, but also more agile, flexible and faster. We have reduced non-manufacturing or overhead enrollment, by nearly 18%, 80% more than we initially envisioned when we launched our restructuring program. We continue to evolve the organization design so that is business focused starting with consumers and customers and so that it is simpler, more effective, more responsive and more efficient. We've organized around industry-based sectors. We're streamlining and de-duplicating the work of the business units and selling operations. We've consolidated four brand building functions into one. Each of these changes reduces complexity and each creates clear accountability for performance and results, a more focused portfolio of brands and businesses will enable further changes. We should be close to the high end of our estimated 16% to 22% non-manufacturing enrollment reduction range by the end of this fiscal year, more than a year ahead of plan. We have additional opportunity to improve marketing efficiency in both media and non-media areas while increasing overall marketing effectiveness and the strength of our programs. We continue to drive marketing productivity through an optimized mix driven by new, more efficient digital media. We have quietly strengthened and invested in all of our digital capabilities including mobile, search and social with a wide range of partners. More than 30% of our working media is now digital. We have developed proprietary systems to target digital media more precisely and more efficiently. Three of our brand communications designed specifically for digital were among the top 10 YouTube viewings in 2014. These efficiencies are enabling us to maintain strong media weights despite the cost pressure we're facing from foreign exchange. We're focused on driving productivity improvement up and down the income statement and across the balance sheet, disciplined working capital management, strong execution of our supply chain financing program and the scarcity mentality and capital spending are driving cash flow results. One of the productivity related questions we often hear concerns developing market margins. We're growing constant currency earnings margins in developing markets. Constant currency earnings grew two times faster than sales in 2013, four times faster than sales in 2014 and are forecast to grow four times faster than sales again this year. Over those three years, we will have grown constant currency earnings 12%, 26% and 26%, respectively. Even with the unprecedented FX impact, we're making progress. Our margin all-in in Latin America is forecast to be up more than a point this year. In the BRIC markets, Brazil and India should each be up about 4 points and China should hold its industry leading margin. Russia is forecast to be done a few points because the pricing intended to recover the FX impacts will not be fully in place until the spring. In total, though, we're forecasting developing market margins including FX to be up about 60 basis points for the year. The final priority area I'll touch on this morning is execution, the only strategy our consumers and customers actually see. For many of our big brands, building trial is still a huge opportunity; for example, repurchase rates on unit dose laundry detergents are over 50%, but trial rates are barely double-digits. We have a number of programs underway to increase trial on our brands. In several categories in many countries, we have an opportunity to improve coverage, dedication and in-store merchandising of our brands. We're investing selectively in dedicated sales coverage of merchandising to improve execution for shoppers in-store and online. This should lead to improved distribution, shelving, merchandising and pricing execution to consistently win at the first moment of truce. We're also continuing to grow our e-Commerce business with omnichannel and pure-play e-tailers as shoppers evolve their shopping preferences and habits. As we look beyond the January-March quarter, we're hopeful that industry and company tailwinds will begin to improve. Productivity should continue to grow. The benefits from portfolio strengthening and simplification should continue to build. Pricing should help. Oil-based commodity costs should become a tailwind by the fourth quarter. Beyond the cost-benefit lower energy prices will hopefully become a stimulant to demand in petroleum importing countries. The world's Top 15 oil importing countries which include the U.S., China, Japan and many Western European markets, account for nearly 2/3rds of P&G's global sales and an even higher share of profits. Interest rates should remain low and we hold out hope for a sequentially stronger economy in the United States, our largest market. But there will continue to be headwinds. Foreign exchange is obviously at the top of the list and has a significant short-term impact, pricing to recover that impact, taken by both P&G and other industry players is likely to result in some market contraction and reduced consumption in several countries. Lower commodity costs will create a consumption headwind in energy producing countries and political instability will continue to result on some ongoing amount of market level disruption. In a time of unprecedented currency devaluation that impacts our company more than any other in our industry, it's important to stay balanced. We need to balance doing what's right for the short, mid and long term. We need to balance the focus on delivering operating cash flow in the short term and continuing to deliver good returns for shareholders with continuing to invest in our businesses, brands, products, capabilities and people for the mid- and long term health of the company. We're maintaining our forecast for organic sales growth of low- to mid-single digits for the fiscal year. We delivered 2% organic sales growth in the first half of the year and we could see a modest acceleration in the second half. Pricing should be a larger contributor to sales growth in the second half as price increases are more fully reflected in our results. We're seeing positive trends in big core businesses like U.S. Baby Care, Fabric Care and Grooming and Hair Care and we're continuing to expand several important product innovations, pants, PODS, beads, Flexball and Swirl, upgraded hair care products, Always Discreet. We're also maintaining our outlook for double-digit constant currency core earnings per share growth for the fiscal year. We expect foreign exchange to have a 12-point impact on core earnings per share growth for the year. This is more than double what we had estimated last quarter and more than five times the impact we expected at the beginning of the fiscal year. Including FX, we now expect core earnings per share to be in-line to down low-single-digits versus last year core earnings per share of $4.09. We're now forecasting all-in sales to be down 3% to 4% for the fiscal year. This includes a 5 point drag from foreign exchange and a 1-point impact from minor brand divestitures. We expect all-in GAAP earnings per share to be down mid-teens versus the fiscal year -- prior fiscal year. Essentially all of the year-to-year reduction in GAAP earnings per share is due to the $0.58 of one-time, non-cash battery impairments. In total, current year GAAP earnings per share includes $0.67 per share of non-core items. In addition to impairments, the other main items are $0.20 per share of restructuring costs and about $0.14 of gains in discontinued operations from the combination of the Duracell and pet businesses. We're currently forecasting 96% adjusted free cash flow productivity, above guidance of at least 90%. We're maintaining our outlook for cash return to shareholders. We plan to return cash to share owners through dividend payments of about $7 billion and share repurchase in the range of $5 billion to $7 billion, $10 billion to $12 billion all-in. This forecasting guidance range assumes mid-January spot rates for foreign exchange. Further, significant currency weakness, including Venezuela, is not anticipated within our guidance range. Our outlook is based on current market growth rates which we're monitoring closely, especially in markets where we taking large price increases to offset currency impacts. We also continue to monitor unrest in several markets in the Middle East, Russia and the Ukraine and we continue to closely monitor markets like Venezuela and Argentina where pricing controls, import restrictions and access to dollars can present risk. On the flip side, our guidance does not reflect some potential tailwinds. Our results can improve if currencies ease, if markets begin to expand in a sustainable way or if U.S. economic growth accelerates. There are a few things you should keep in mind as you construct your models for the second half of the year. Our organic sales comps ease a bit in the back half of the year and we're taking significant pricing to offset foreign exchange impacts. We expect significant top and bottom line headwinds from foreign exchange in the back half of the year, including a large negative impact from balance sheet revaluation related to the Swiss franc in the March quarter. There is also a quarterly translation hit to earnings as we're operationally net short to Swiss franc due to the significant local cost structure related to our Europe and India, Middle East and Africa headquarters in Geneva. Productivity savings will build as the year progresses and we expect sequential improvement in commodity costs as we go through the remainder of the year. Stepping back, we're not only investing in our brands and products, but also in critical company capabilities that will enable much better consumer and customer responsiveness with systems that are more agile, faster, better and cheaper. We have talked about the supply chain, the overall goal is a seamless and synchronized flow of information and product with shoppers, customers, retailers and e-tailers. Our strategies continue to sharpen. Our category and brand business models continue to improve. Our product innovation pipeline continues to fill. Our productivity yield continues to grow with several more years of significant cash and cost savings ahead. We're operationalizing plans more consistently and executing them more broadly and reliably. We continue to invest strategically in additional capacity for critical developing markets and we continue to rationalize our manufacturing processes, so that common, simpler and more globally standard making and packing platforms support accelerated product innovation at a lower cash, capital and operating costs. We continue to evolve the organization design so that it is business focused, starting with consumers and customers, simpler more effective, more responsive and more efficient. We continue to invest selectively in sales coverages and merchandising to improve execution for shoppers in stores and online and we continue to invest in product innovation technologies and product initiative acceleration. Through this transformation, we're creating a more in touch, agile, coordinated and integrated organization that puts winning with the consumer first. We're sharpening our strategies and business models. We're operationalizing plans and executing with more consistency and excellence. These are the choices and capabilities that enable balanced growth and value creation in the mid and long term as we work our way through the currency devaluations in the short term. That concludes our prepared remarks for this morning. As a reminder, business segment information is provided in our press release and will be available in slides which we posted on our website, www.pg.com, following the call. With that, I would be happy to take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson from Citi. Wendy Nicholson : My question has to do with the multiplier effect between the currency pressure on your top line and bottom line because it's just so much bigger than we see at any other company and my question is how much of that I've how much of that is going to go away and this is sort of a long term strategic issue how much that is going to go away as you get your new plans any manufacturing facilities online and emerging markets is that just a structural thing whenever going to have more three raises in place plans disproportionate significantly on our earnings. Jon Moeller : Clearly as it is apparent you understand from your question, the difference between the top line and bottom line impact FX is driven by sourcing. And were product is being manufactured and imported two. And it also has to do with where we're disproportionately sized versus our competitors just in terms of our business footprint. We disproportionately impacted due to our business size and market position in countries that have seen some of the highest levels of devaluations. In Venezuela, Russia, the Ukraine and Japan, we have significant businesses and we estimate that in those markets our top and bottom I impacts are more than double our top multinational competitors and then we're also importing significant amount of product in the markets like Venezuela into markets like Argentina into markets like Russia and Japan. We're working as we rightly point out to further localize our manufacturing supply chain over time and that should help as we go forward. We're building roughly 20 new manufacturing facilities, all of which are in developing markets which are the ones that have been most impacted by foreign exchange. As we do that and even with our existing manufacturing platforms, we're working to localize our suppliers with us. As I mentioned in the example on the ruble, this is both a cost in terms of importation product but also importing materials and the more that we can localize both of those components of the supply chain the better off we're going to be in terms of being operationally hedged to FX. The issue will never go away and its entirety. Again, think you mentioned a very good example on blades and razors. We're not going to have 180 blades and razors manufacturing facilities but we're localizing to a greater extent even that supply chain. With significant investments we made for example in Mexico. So, hopefully, this will continue to reduce as we move forward but it is not likely to ever completely disappear. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo. Chris Ferrara : Jon, I guess obviously FX drives and need for pricing. Jon, I think you said you're going to be more aggressively taking pricing in the back half. But I guess the question is with crude at 45, was there a risk that we get into a situation like '08 - '09 where you can price more than peers and ended up losing share? Jon Moeller : Fair question and that's, obviously, something we're going to watch very carefully. The good news if you want to call it that is in markets where the most significant pricing is needed, the currency impacts far overwhelmed the energy costs impacts. So again going back to our example of Russia with 78% currency devaluation we might not be able to recover all of that and certainly we're going to have to take into account both competitive consumer dynamics which will reflect the commodity cost environment as well. So we'll watch that carefully. That's also why as I talk about the efforts to offset FX, I always mentioned as well productivity and cost savings. There is going to have to be a higher component of that this time around for the reason you cite as well as for the simple reason that our euro and yen domicile competitors don't have as much of a headwind as we have. So we're going to have to approach this very deliberately, very carefully. But still I think there is a significant opportunity for pricing. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Faucher with JPMorgan. John Faucher : Want to talk a little bit about the organic revenue growth guidance here and you talked about an improving trends in the second quarter, can you talk about what you are seeing? Potentially what you're seeing in the third? And then going back to -- looking at this -- why not just take it down to low-singles, I guess from that standpoint. Not that I think many people are pricing in it but it seems a little overly optimistic and then, sort of looking at Chris's question here, what's the outlook if you look at things getting better sequentially in terms of the volume versus pricing breakdown? Is it all going to be pricing as things get better in the back half of the year? Do you think you can get volumes improving? Thanks. Jon Moeller : So first of all, low single-digit organic sales growth is as you know covered within our guidance range and we're going to have to -- there is both tailwinds and headwinds going forward here. We have seen some pickup in the U.S. market as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, volume was up two points in the developed markets in the quarter and we have seen an increase in the market growth rate in the U.S. And if that continues, that's obviously our biggest market and our most profitable market that could be a real benefit to the top line. We have several businesses where we have admittedly struggled recently but where we believe the fix is right around the corner. I mentioned in our prepared remarks the family care business, that's a big business for us in North America where we've been losing share. We've adjusted pricing on that business and are starting to see both volume and sales respond. So, hopefully, that picks up for us. Another big business that I didn't mention in the prepared remarks is Mexico. If we look at sales in Mexico were down almost 20% on the quarter, it constitutes almost a full point of organic sales growth. So if it were not for Mexico we would've rounded it to 3%. And the driver there is a combination of three things. There is a consumption tax increase which was put in place January a year ago. So that's annualizing on the consumption impacts of that are annualizing. We also took pricing to deal with the value in peso and we changed some of our trade terms to pricing transparency in the marketplace. All of that should begin to annualize here very shortly. So if we continue to make progress, if we continue the growth that we have on some of our big brands, if we can address a few of the admitted challenges that we have, I mentioned China as another example, there is no reason we couldn't get up into pick up another point of growth. And then we will have to see what happens as we price as Chris mentioned as you rightly mentioned to market sizes in some of these other markets. I would say quite honestly there is more uncertainty in the top line and there has been in sometimes because of all these variables. But there is both positive variables and variables to watch out for. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : I guess two things. One was just to clarify that last point, Jon, that when you say pick up another point of growth that you meant another point in the back half not another point on the full-year from the 2% run-rate? Jon Moeller : Yes. Lauren Lieberman : Perfect. The other thing was on the other promotional environment in the U.S. I think Unilever's comments were pretty direct around their savings be it on commodities or obviously currency benefits being reinvested in past back to the consumer. So was curious about your view of the promotional environment particularly in the U.S. and then also specifically looking at beauty. It just feels like there is -- this is anecdotal, but it feels like the year has started off in a very, very promotional way. So I was just curious about particularly on beauty that would be great. Jon Moeller : Okay let me start way on macro and then I will get down to micro including beauty. In general as you know, promotion is the last place we would like in most cases to spend a dollar, we would rather spend it on equity or innovation and if you just look at the drivers of our top line growth over time, I think that it bears that out. So in the quarter that we just completed pricing inclusive of promotion was a one point benefit to the top line, it's been a benefit for 16 consecutive quarters, it's been a benefit for 10 consecutive years. So it doesn't mean that we won't have individual product categories that are up and down at a given time given both the trial needs of innovation we're putting into the market and the competitive situation but broadly that is not our game. Reflecting just on the U.S. market, so the first point of your question, if we look at the indices for percentage of volume sold a promotion over the last four quarters, the indices sequentially have been a one-to-one, this is all business category business not just P&G, 101, 103, 101 and 98. So broadly, that's not indicative of an environment that's heavily promotional. Now, again within individual product categories of course there are differences. And to be fair those figures that I just provided you don't include couponing, but they don't include couponing at the base period either. So they are kind of free of that. On P&G Beauty we did increased promotion a little bit particularly on hair care behind some of the product I mentioned that are driving share growth on Pantene and Head & Shoulders. It's very important particularly on Pantene given some of the struggle that we went through prior to the last that seven months that we give opportunities to consumers to experience and re-experience and retry our brands. So there has been some level of promotional increase but again most of our spending is on equity building and innovation and will remain that way. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Olivia Tong : On M&A and the pairing down of your portfolio, do the current market dynamics change your thinking anyway a brand brands or businesses that might be up for divesture or harvesting including the time of [inaudible]? And conversely as you speak with potential inquirers I suspect some of them might be overseas without going into specifics, have your discussions have been impacted in any way as map [ph] changes for that? Jon Moeller : We view the strategic were making on the portfolio as a long-term strategic move and so the impact of one year in FX either positive or negative doesn't dramatically change that. And in my conversations with potential buyers, they seem to be similarly oriented. They're looking at longer periods of time. Now you can imagine that there are specific situations where let's say you have a large component of the business that happens to be operating in Russia or the Ukraine or name a couple of markets, that certainly -- I wouldn't say that it affects buyers strategic interests but it affects, obviously, the tone of the overall conversation as it should but I view that really as on a margin on the whole as the years of all and as the currency situation has worsened. Honestly I can't think of one conversation that we've been holding with potential buyers that has changed dramatically in terms of its tone as a result of currency. So I think we're full steam ahead. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley Dara Mohsenian : Jon, you highlighted the recent volume pickup in the U.S. and it looks clearly like retail sales growth has accelerated the last couple of months in the scanner data including through mid-January release today. That being said, the two year average look relatively stable given easier comps the last couple of months in the scanner data. I just want to get a sense from you on how much of the recent U.S. top line rebound in your mind is due to a more sustainable U.S. consumer recovery or is it more easier comps? And then second on pricing can you give us a bit more granularity on how much of the FX pressure this you think you can eventually recover through pricing and also from a commodity standpoint given its expected return to a tailwind by Q4, do you expect to get a margin windfall at some point looking out to fiscal 2016 or do you think that will be priced back to the marketplace? Thanks. Jon Moeller : Sorry, I was struggling there to remember all components of this. I'm going to start from the back and go to the front. On commodities, if oil stayed at current prices we would expect an annualized benefit of about $600 million before tax that should start flowing through in the fourth quarter. If you look at the combination of our contractual lags and our inventories, on average they are six to seven weeks, so the recent moves should start coming through really by the very end of this quarter, but more fully in the fourth quarter and we will just have to see what happens in terms of what competitors do relative to pricing. Having the FX issues at the same time, though, directionally moves us in a position of expecting more pricing rather than less. But you're right to point it out as something that we need to watch. Historically in FX moves like this, not identical to this because this is one of the bigger ones we've ever seen, but historically, we've been able to recover over time about 50% to 2/3rds of the impact through pricing and then we get the balance through productivity savings. My sense is we're going to have to move that balance and maybe this time we will get 40% or 50%. We'll see. We're going to have to depend more on productivity savings to get there. The good news is we've got a very strong productivity program that we have visibility on for a couple of years going out. So that's how I look at pricing in general. On your question on the U.S., of how much of that is just better comps and how much of its market, again, I would just point to the market growth rates which are up about 0.5 point in the U.S. So at least that portion of it is due to the market and then I mentioned that we're holding or building share in businesses representing more than 60% of sales. So there is an element there of share growth as well, all of that combined with the easier comps driving the data. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Schmidt with Deutsche Bank. Bill Schmidt : Three questions. The first is there a concrete turnaround plan in China? Because it seems like it's been two or three years now with share losses in a lot of big categories and I know you guys understand that there is a problem there but I haven't really heard anything concretely what you are going to do to turn it around. And then on the divestitures, I know you said 35 brands have been sold. Can you tell us what percentage of the 10% of sales you're done with there? And then the last one, which is more technical, how big magnitude-wise is going to be the Swiss franc impact in the March quarter? Thanks. Jon Moeller : So again I'll start with the last one. There should be about an $80 million after-tax balance sheet revaluation impact from the Swiss franc in the third quarter and then we will have the translation issue as well. As I mentioned, we're short the franc overall and that's driven by the fact that we have a very large cost base there. Our European and Eastern European, Middle East, Africa headquarters are there and Switzerland is a small country so we have proportionately less volume. So that will be an impact from a balance sheet evaluation in the third quarter and from a translation standpoint in both the third and the fourth quarters. On China, we've built that business. We've grown about 50% over the last four years; it's now our second largest business in both sales and profit. There are two things that we're working to improve in China. One, quite frankly is the amount of price transparency that exists in the marketplace. I think the market in general has become over the last year or so, last two years, a little bit too promotional in nature which tends to happen when you have major changes in consumption patterns. But it's created a degree of opacity in terms of consumers and customers understanding the true value equation that exists and we need to fix that. I think in general the industry is working to fix that and that's why you see some of the impacts that you've seen from some of the other manufacturers in terms of their results in China as well and I would say that we're in the fifth inning in terms of getting that squared around. And then as I mentioned in several categories discussions previously, there is just a massive opportunity in China as that market [inaudible]. If you look at that market by price tier, the premium and super premium price tier, so the top two price tiers now represent 50% of consumption in the market, so across competitors and those tiers are growing at 11%. The balance of the market is flat. In some categories, we haven't followed the consumer as quickly as we needed to up that price ladder, that's part of the issue on Olay. We're not yet where we want to be for instance, on Pampers. Though as I mentioned, the premium pant product coming to market this month will help significantly. So those are really two of the areas generally that we're focused on, on dealing with China, but again, there is huge opportunity in that market Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers from UBS Steve Powers : Jon, a question on Beauty, maybe following up a little bit about your comments there just on Olay. I guess it continues to be a work in progress with organic growth negative despite successes like Pantene domestically. Can you talk just a little bit more about the key initiatives there and what is likely to change versus stay the same given David Taylor's new appointment to that segment? Thanks. Jon Moeller : I mentioned the progress on Pantene and the Hair Care portfolio broadly which we're very encouraged by. On Olay, we actually did fairly well in the U.S. in the last quarter. I think we were up about 3%, John, can get that number right for you afterwards, but I think that's pretty close. But we're still working in several other parts of the world as I mentioned to increase the salience of the brand in terms of both the channels, the price tiers and the product benefits that consumers are looking for in skin care products and that's work that takes some time. I would say we're still in the early days there. We have people working on that business who have deep experience in skin care have been associated historically with the better days on Olay and so we continue to be very hopeful that will come around. David, frankly, brings a new set of eyes which can only help and has tremendous brand building experience across many of our product categories. He's managed in the beauty business before, he managed our hair care business in China when he and I were working in China together in the mid-90s and so that's only good. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi, RBC Capital Markets. Nik Modi : Most of my questions were asked but I was curious, Jon, if you can talk about pricing analytics at P&G and over the last couple of years if you've seen an evolution or increased sophistication, more accuracy because if you go back the last couple of years on the pricing, it really led to a multi-quarter kind of string of share losses. So I'm just curious if you kind of sharpened some of the analytics on the pricing side? Thanks. Jon Moeller : Yes, the first thing I would say, Nik, is the primary metric that we're looking at as we analyze pricing choices both up and down is value creation and that may mean and I don't want to overstate this that there may be such situations where it's right to accept some share loss to get the structural economics to an attractive place in our brands. In terms of, though knowing if value creation is the primary metric, whether we're delivering that or not on a real-time basis, we have been constantly working to improve our analytical capability. I won't say that we're all the way to where we need to be and I mentioned that's an investment in capabilities and this is one of the area, analytics in general that we're investing in, but simple things like our sales force being in the field as opposed to being in the office working on brand work will only help in terms of understanding what's happening on a real-time basis. Also as I mentioned, I think in response to John's question we're going to be depending just as much on productivity as we're pricing to try to deal with this FX issue and that was not the case in the years that John mentioned. We didn't have the productivity program and certainly didn't have it at the level that we have it now. So we were more dependent on pricing as a way to restore those structural economics. But this is obviously something that we have to stay close to as you rightly point out and as several others have and is something that we will. We will not get it right every time. We cannot predict competitive behavior; we can't completely predict consumer behavior and so there will be some steps forward and some steps backward. But hopefully, the net is forward as it has been historically. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research. Javier Escalante : My question is on Beauty and particularly on Prestige. It seems like it led the decline of the [inaudible] this quarter and more broadly when you talk about the portfolio you basically said it's structurally attractive categories that play to Proctor's strength and I wonder whether you would say that channel source specific Prestige Beauty and professional hair care do you think that plays to Proctor's strength or not? Thank you. Jon Moeller : A large part of the trend in Prestige is driven by a very strong base period where we had a very strong innovation program. So that's primarily what's going on there. I think your question on fit with P&G's core capabilities and strengths is a good question and an appropriate question. I'll just provide a quick refresher on those capabilities and strengths because they do provide along with structural attractiveness and track record, the screens through which we look at our portfolio strategy and those core strengths are branding, innovation, consumer understanding, go-to-market and benefiting where appropriate from our scale. And I've given the example before on our pharmaceuticals business where if you go across those capabilities, consumer understanding not terribly relevant, brand building, advertising, only legally permissible in three countries in the world, innovation challenged just because of the model in the industry, go-to-market, grocery stores, mass merchants, doctors. That's a clear example of a business that doesn't benefit from our core capabilities. Our job in that case becomes to find somebody who does have those capabilities who can create more value than we can create and then monetize some of that value for our shareholders. We have gotten out of businesses because of channel fit in the past. I would argue that the pet care choice was in part related to that. There was a specialty pet channel; there was an influencer channel with both the breeders and veterinarians that we did not have broader company expertise in. So those are the kinds of things that we will be looking at as we finalize portfolio choices. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Steib with Credit Suisse. Michael Steib : My question relates to how you expect mix to impact earnings going forward in the second half in particular? It was obviously a tailwind on the top line growth this quarter but a drag on gross margin. I wonder why that is and how you expect that to drive earnings going forward? Jon Moeller : Basically in a scenario where we have relatively similar growth rates between developed and developing markets and where we have relatively similar growth rates across our product segments. So in other words, Beauty grows faster than it did in the last quarter, but the mix impact is not significant. In quarters where one of those -- two things aren't true, so where developing markets grow disproportionately or where our higher margin businesses like Beauty don't grow as fast as the rest of the portfolio. We will have a mix impact on the bottom line and so it really comes down to your estimation of those two drivers going forward as to what the mix impact is going to be. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital. Connie Maneaty : I do have a question on Venezuela. I appreciated your commentary about all the components in FX impact and in that context I'm wondering why you're still reporting your results at the official rate given where SICAD 2 is and where the parallel rate is? So can you quantify for us the move of your Venezuela results from SICAD 1 to SICAD 2? Jon Moeller : We provide all of our exposures in our disclosures because we know this is an important item for investors. I haven't actually done the math, but you can, the reason that we continue to translate our results at a combination of SICAD 1, which is 11 to 12 and then the 6.3 official rate is simply because those are the rates at which we're transacting business in Venezuela. We're getting dollars at those rates for imports of both finished product and raw materials. We're told that dividends and royalties would be paid for example, at the SICAD 1 rate, right now as I think you may be aware, the Government of Venezuela's working through as I understand it modifications to the exchange regime. I don't have transparency or visibility into that. Obviously, we will look at that and understand really what's the rate at which we're going to be transacting business and that's the rate that we should be translating our results at. Importantly, I'm in no way suggesting that others will come to different outcomes or are doing anything that's wrong or incorrect. For them it should reflect what rates they are transacting business at. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello with Raymond James. Joe Altobello : Just two quick ones, I guess. First, how much of the pricing you've taken so far or announced to the trade has been matched by competitors? And here I'm specifically talking about the developed world not developing and then, secondly was there anything unusual in the month of December organic growth of 5% because previous to that, if you look at October-November it looks like your flat to modestly down going into that month and I would imagine there was probably some pre-buying or pull forward ahead of some price increases? Thanks. Jon Moeller : Joe, broadly without going into detail because we can't do that, our pricing is going to be centered on the developing markets. There is not a lot of developed market pricing that is planned. As a result and because of the timing of certain moves, it is still early days in terms of understanding both what the competitive and what the consumer dynamics are going to be. Maybe we will have an update for you at CAGNY, but even that will probably be too soon. We're in the early days there, but again, the main point is most of this we focused on developing markets not on developed markets. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Bill Chappell : Just actually following up on Bill Schmidt's question which I'm not sure I got the answer to, percentage of sales that the 35 brands that you've divested or consolidated represents of kind of that total 10% and whether that 10% number is actually change as you have started to look at the portfolio a little bit closer? And then also with regard to -- I didn't really understand what you're saying in terms of the timing of the shares coming back in a little bit later from the Duracell divesture, so maybe can you help me understand that too? Jon Moeller : Yes, all helpful and thanks for reminding me of the other part of Bill's question. You know what the Duracell sales are, you know what the pet sales are, they have all been moved to discontinued operations and we've given you the amounts of those moves that have been made and those are the two largest. And then, there is a bunch of smaller things. I think you can get pretty close to an estimate with a little bit of thumb in the air on where we're at. The number is not a static number, it does change. We have said very clearly that we intend to create value as we exit businesses. It doesn't make any sense to exit a business if we can't create value in the process and so by definition, we haven't made definitive choices on what goes and what stays as we're still working to negotiate terms and see if we can in fact, create sufficient value in some instances. So that's not a static figure that was a figure that was designed to get us close. Oh shares, thank you. I mentioned that -- as I've read several of your updates from the sell side, we obviously haven't given you a lot of direction other than saying sometime in the second half we will close the transaction with Berkshire Hathaway on Duracell and retire those shares. And so I've seen a number of the estimates, understandably picking different time points and one of them being July 1st and my only point is while we're making good progress, I don't expect that this will be complete by July 1st. I do expect it will be completed in the second half of the calendar year, but I think July 1st is aggressive as you model the retiring of those shares. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Sanford C. Bernstein. Ali Dibadj : So believe it or not I still have a question around FX and I get that you're guiding everything organically effectively the same and you're attributing the guide down to FX alone. But I guess, why is that good enough? So why aren't we seeing things like some of your peers are doing that's more aggressive internally to offset some of those impacts? We've talked a little bit about pricing, but productivity, it doesn't seem like it's ramping up, at least it doesn't look like it yet. It certainly looks like your investing in some areas in SG&A and I'm certainly mindful of the word that you used earlier, balance. But what are you doing internally to pull in the belt a little bit more given the headwinds from currency that you are facing? Jon Moeller : First of all, I think if we step back and look at constant currency earnings growth that we're forecasting for the year and guiding to, it's double-digit. So that's not an insignificant number and I get asked just as frequently and I think appropriately, if that isn't too much as I do if that isn't too little and it all comes back to this balance point. If you look at our competitors, I mentioned in response to Wendy's question whether we like it or not our impacts from FX are more significant than some of our competitors simply because of our footprint and obviously we have others that are as you know either euro or yen domiciled or have largely a U.S. focus of their footprint. And so even with that double-digit constant currency earnings per share growth, we end up at or slightly below a year ago. We will pull forward not necessarily -- we will execute any smart cost savings program. I mentioned the fact that we're going to be close to the top end of our range on overhead reduction by the end of this year, that's more than a year ahead of pace. And again, is at the top of a 6 point range. So we're continuing to move pretty aggressively. But as you rightly point out and as we have tried to communicate, we need to do that in a balanced way. We just have so many things that present opportunity, both in the way that we operate in our long-term cost structure in delighting consumers with some of our brands, products and technologies that it would be the wrong answer to pull back from those. So we will continue to be balanced. We will continue to be diligent and aggressive in terms of the identification of savings opportunities. Another one for example that we've talked about, granted it doesn't happen all this year, but getting those six mixing centers set up and operational by the end of February that was acceleration of a project that we did specifically to help deal with the current reality and we'll look for more opportunities like that. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Jon Andersen with William Blair. Jon Andersen : Jon, I think you mentioned earlier that volume actually declined in developing markets in the quarter. And I'm wondering if you could just talk a little bit about that, is that a reflection of further slowing in consumption in developing markets? Or do you attribute it to this FX related pricing that you discussed and what your expectations are there going forward? Jon Moeller : Quarter-to-quarter there was no significant change in developing market growth from a market standpoint. The one exception to that which is very difficult to sort out is Russia, which when you look at it actually the growth rate increased, but I think that's a large part purchase ahead of pricing that people know are coming. But I would say the market is not a big driver of the small volume reduction we had in developing markets. One driver is one that you rightly point out which is foreign exchange. Where we haven't priced yet on some of the most recent moves like the big ruble move, we have been pricing in places like the Ukraine, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Venezuela obviously when that was legally allowed and so that is having some impact. And typically we see that having an impact in most cases for about a 12-month period, in more significant cases like Russia maybe a longer period of time. The other impact is what I indicated which is some issues we've had in both Mexico that was, sales were down 20%. I'm not sure what the volume was but it was significant and in China, where we\u2019ve been kind of flattish. So those are two situations where we're working to improve. But really, markets with the exception of the unknown in Russia are pretty much holding quarter-to-quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference.

Bernstein Caroline Levy - CLSA Unidentified Company Representative : Good morning and welcome to Procter & Gamble's quarter-end conference call. Today's discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections. As required by Regulation G, P&G needs to make you aware that during the call the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Management believes these measures provide investors valuable information on the underlying growth trends of the business. Organic refers to reported results excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange where applicable. Adjusted free cash flow represents operating cash flow, less capital expenditures and excluding tax payments for the pet care divestiture. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings adjusted for impairment charges. Any measure described as core refers to the equivalent GAAP measure adjusted for certain items. Currency neutral refers to the equivalent GAAP measure excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate changes. P&G has posted on its website, www.pg.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP and other financial measures. Now I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller. Jon Moeller : Good morning. January to March was another challenging quarter from a macro standpoint with significant foreign exchange headwinds, modest market growth and continued political and economic volatility. The currency challenge increased through the quarter with currencies in Brazil, Turkey and the Ukraine weakening sequentially versus the dollar. Despite these challenges we grew cost and currency core earnings per share at a double digit rate. We grew core gross margin including and excluding foreign exchange and made strong operating margin progress up a 170 basis points on a constant currency basis. All of this was enabled by over 400 basis points of productivity savings. Organic sales grew modestly up 1%, Grooming, Healthcare and Baby, Feminine and Family Care, segments grew 9%, 6% and 2% respectively. Organic sales were in line with the prior year in Fabric and Home Care due to the timing of innovation launches in North America in both the base period and the current year. The base period included pipeline shipments for the major Fabric Care innovation bundle including the Tide Plus upgrades and introduction of Tide Simply Clean & Fresh and Gain Flings, which led the 6% organic sales growth for the segment in the year ago quarter. The current period includes the impact of trade inventory dry down ahead of the launch of new liquid detergent and fabric enhanced reformulations. Fabric Care consumption remains strong in North America with market share growth on both a value and a volume basis. Beauty segment, results reflects softness in Prestige Fragrance and mass Skin Care. Organic volume was down two points versus the prior year, developing market volume was down low single digits, following price increases taken to offset foreign exchange devaluation in several countries and adjustments made to correct trade inventories in Mexico and China. These adjustments had about a one point impact on the company\u2019s top-line in the quarter. Developed market organic volume was down 2%, driven mainly by timing impacts associated with the April 1st increase in the Japanese consumption tax last year. Shipments in Japan were up 22%, ahead of the consumption tax increase last year and as a result were down mid teams in the current year quarter. This had about a half point on total company organic sales growth. Pricing contributed two points to organic sales growth and mix added a point. All-in sales were down 8% versus the prior year, due to an eight point headwind from foreign exchange and a one point reduction from minor brand divestitures. We held or grew worldwide share on businesses representing about half of company\u2019s sales and on businesses representing more than 60% of sales in our home U.S. market. We continue to grow share on many of our category leading brands in countries where it matters most. Pampers tied, let Fusion and all was in the United States for example. On a constant currency basis core earnings per share were up 10%, keeping us on track for double digit constant currency core earnings per share growth for the fiscal year. Including FX, which was an 18 percentage point drag on the quarter, core earnings per share were $0.92, down 8% versus the prior year. Foreign exchange hurts total $530 million after tax in the March quarter and $1.2 billion after tax fiscal year-to-date. They\u2019re forecast to be a $1.5 billion after tax hurt for the fiscal year. We\u2019re managing through the FX challenge with the combination of pricing, mixed enhancement and productivity cost savings and by pursuing opportunities on brands in countries and regions unaffected by FX. Gross and operating margin growth improved sequentially versus the December quarter both in all and an ex-currency basis, driven by productivity savings. Core gross margin increased 20 basis points in the March quarter versus the prior year. This compares to a 20 basis point decline last quarter. Excluding the foreign exchange core gross margin was up 90 basis points. This compares to a 40 basis point improvement last quarter. In the current period cost savings of approximately 250 basis points and 90 basis points of improvement from higher pricing were offset by a 150 basis points mix, 50 basis points of innovation and capacity investments and a modest increase in commodity cost. Core SG&A cost as a percentage of sales increased 50 basis points, excluding FX they were down 80 basis points. A 160 basis points of overhead and marketing savings were more than offset by a 130 basis points of foreign exchange impacts, 50 points of organization capability investments in R&D and sales and 30 basis points of other operating items. Cost of goods sold and SG&A savings totaled 410 basis points, as we continue to accelerate productivity initiatives and programs and they deliver ahead of our objectives. Core operating margin was down 30 basis points versus the prior year including the FX. This compares to a 60 basis point decline last quarter. Core operating margin excluding the FX was up 170 basis points, 50 basis points better than the 120 point improvement last quarter. We expect even stronger margin expansion in the fourth quarter. The effective tax rate on core earnings was 19.6%, half a point above last year\u2019s quarterly rate. This leads us on track with our guidance for a fiscal year core tax rate of about 21%, which is roughly in line with last fiscal year\u2019s rate. March quarter, all-in GAAP earnings per share was $0.75, which include approximately $0.07 per share for non-core restructuring charges and $0.10 per share of charges from discontinued operations, primarily an adjustment to [indiscernible] carry in balances to reflect P&G\u2019s March ending stock price. We generated $3.6 billion in operating cash flow and $2.9 billion in adjusted free cash flow, with a 117% adjusted free cash flow productivity this quarter. Last week, we increased our dividend for the 59th consecutive year, up 3% where we paying a dividend for the 125th consecutive year every year, since our incorporation in 1890. In summary, we generated modest organic sales growth in the quarter, constant currency core earnings per share grew double digits driven by 410 basis points of productivity savings. Constant currency gross and operating margins were well ahead of a year ago and we continue to build on our strong track record of cash productivity and cash return to shareholders. While we must and will manage through the external headwinds and market volatilities that is largely out of our control, the bulk of our effort is centered on driving significant opportunities in our control. Brands initiatives and product innovation, business and brand portfolio simplification, overhead savings and major supply chain productivity initiatives. The company portfolio strengthening and simplification announced last August, strategically resets P&G\u2019s where to play choices. We\u2019re focused on winning with consumers and customers who matter most and channels and countries that matter most, with core brands and businesses that create the strongest consumer preference and the best balance of growth and value creation. We will eliminate 60% of the brands and the complexity they create, while retaining about 85% of sales and 95% of before tax profit. That\u2019s a good trade. The new company will consist of about 65 leading brands where the size, the price and probability of winning near the highest in 10 categories that are structurally attractive and play to P&G\u2019s core strengths of consumer understanding, innovation, branding, go to market and leverage P&G\u2019s scale. They will enable more resources and attention on the biggest opportunities resulting in faster, more profitable growth. It\u2019s a focus portfolio with just seven categories representing 84% of the sales and 85% of profit. It\u2019s also focused geographically with the top five countries for each category delivering about half to essentially all of global profit. Every brand we plan to keep as strategic, with a potential to grow and create value. Within these brands, we will operate with more efficient product line and skew offerings. Reducing that skew is 15% to 20% on the remaining portfolio over the next two years. The skews that shoppers want and consumers use. This continued [indiscernible] new brand and product innovation has the ample room to grow. We will create a faster growing, more profitable company that is far simpler to operate. We currently expect to exit approximately a 100 brand positions with a fair amount of the work already complete. To date we\u2019ve divested this continued or plan the consolidation of over 40 brands and about 40% of targeted sales. We\u2019ve exited the Bleach business, Pet Care, Duracell, MDVIP, double our fragrance brands, the DDF and Naxzema Skin Care brands, Vicks VapoStream and the Camay and Zest bar soup brands. We\u2019re targeting to be in a position to have negotiated and announced the entire program or at least the large components as early as this summer. Roughly one year after our initial announcement and to have executed, in other words, closed program by the end of fiscal 2016. This will enable us to head into fiscal 2017 with a new portfolio fully enplaced. Another significant opportunity is strengthening and focusing our strategies and business models, to win with consumers and in channels and markets that matter most. A strategy topic that has come up with increase in the frequency in recent investor discussions is, if leading brands are still relevant in a winning model and can still grow. We continue to believe the P&G strategy and business model, consumer insights and innovations that lead to consumer preferred products from brands that overtime are leaders in their categories is a winning formula for us, a constant, reliable and sustainable driver of balance growth and value creation. Over the last five years our category leading billion dollar brands have been growing sales a point faster than our half a billion dollar brands and several points faster than our smaller brands. In most categories our leading brands have leading equities and that promote our scores. They\u2019re brands that retailers want and need in their stores because category leading P&G brands, household penetration and reach drive store traffic. And their purchase frequency and modest price premium drive basket size. Premium brands and product innovation grow categories. These large brands are platforms for innovations, which can be commercialized far more effectively and more profitably and could be done on smaller ones that typically earn disproportionate amount of category profit and create disproportionate amount of category value. A good example is Pampers, our largest brand with $10 billion in annual sales. Pampers is growing at a 5% pace over the past three years. In the largest market the United States, Pampers is driving category value growth of 3%, reversing a multi-year decline caused by the decline in birth rates in both competitor and trade price discounting. P&G\u2019s U.S. diaper share is up at over 90% of customers, widening our margin of category value share leadership to 9 points. The premium priced [indiscernible] line is on track to reach over $750 million in sales this fiscal year up more than 30% versus the prior year, allows us growing in the mid-tier with sales at mid single digits this fiscal year. We\u2019ve built the leading baby diaper business in the U.S. and in the world without a consumer preferred pant style diaper. We recently started the roll out of our new pampers pants designed to provide exceptional dryness and skin comfort in an underwear like design. Achieving fair share of the global pant market represents another $2 billion sales growth opportunity. Another good example is Tide, our second largest brand at about $5 billion in sales. Tide has also been growing ahead of category growth rate building share. In the March quarter of last year, we introduced a strengthened fabric care brand and product line that significantly broadened consumer appeal. We offered shoppers a full range of brands and products priced from above $0.12 to $0.28 a laundry load including broadened pod offerings [ph], new and approved liquid detergent options and Tide Simply Clean and Fresh, a preferred brand of product for many consumers interested in good basic cleaning at attractive everyday value. In addition, we focused on trading in new to the category consumers to Tide, with new washing machine buyer, a new household formation programs. More consumers traded in and traded up and traded down. In fact, Tide household penetration is up more than 200 basis points for the first time in several years. We recently hit an all-time record high U.S. laundry detergent value share of 60%. Tide now holds a 40% value share of U.S. laundry detergents, with brand equity and net promoter scores as strong as they\u2019ve never been. Gain is the number two brand in the U.S. detergent category and over a 50 in the share. Both of these leading brands have grown market share over the past 12, 6 and 3 month periods. The Tide and Gain brands have provided a broad platform for unit-dose innovation. They\u2019re trusted leading brands that consumers are willing to try their new product offerings. It would take a lot longer and cause a lot more to generate trial of pods [ph] for the significantly smaller brand or across the portfolio of several brands. Tide Pods of Gain Flings have reached a combined value share of over 10% of the US laundry market and P&G share of the Unit Dose segment is nearly 80%. We continue to expand Pods around the world leveraging another multi-billion dollar brand Ariel. We expect our Unit Dose products alone to reach $1.5 billion in sales this fiscal year. Downy along with its sister brand Lenor is another multi-billion dollar franchise in the fabric care category. It\u2019s been growing at a high single digit rate over the past three years, driven mainly by the success of our scent beads innovation. Scent beads were a new product for consumers to add to their laundry regiment. We could have tried to launch them with a new brand. We chose instead to leverage the strong equity of Downy and Lenor along with Gain and Bounce to commercialize this new innovation. We launched Downy Unstopables in the U.S. about four years ago. Since then, scent beads have grown to 17% of sales in the fabric enhancer category and the category has sustained 3% growth. P&G\u2019s big brands have earned nearly an 80% share of the segment. The largest male and female grooming brands - Gillette, Fusion and Venus have proven to be huge platforms for blade and razor innovation. The original Fusion razor launched in January 2006 is still P&G\u2019s fastest brand to reach $1 billion in sales. We\u2019ve continued the growth of Fusion with the ProGlide innovation in 2010 and the big obvious and preferred flexible innovation last year. Fusion value share of male razors is tracking in the high 50s and is up 2 points from last year. The flexible razor handle innovation is translated into share growth on cartridges. Fusion value share of male cartridges is up more than 2 points versus a year ago. We\u2019ve put 2 million Fusion flexible razors into the hands of men in the U.S. in less than a year since launch and we\u2019re now extending the breakthrough razor innovation to Venus, the market leading female razor brand with Venus Swirl, which began shipping in February. Early consumption results are very strong in less than three months since launch. We\u2019ve sold over a million Swirl razors in the US and Venus\u2019s value share female razors was up more than 10 points nearly 65% in March, the first four month Venus Swirl was available. These new innovations from Gillette have helped reverse the declining value trend, market value trend in the U.S. blades and razors improving year-on-year growth rate by 3 points versus the 12 months prior to the flexible launch. Consumers significantly prefer these better performing products. The market leading consumer trusted Fusion and Venus brands are driving awareness, trial and share results from new innovations that will be more difficult for a new smaller brand to achieve. We have taken a similar approach in the female incontinence category, leveraging our multi-billion dollar Always brand to enter this $7 billion faster growing global category. We began shipments of Always Discreet in the UK in July and the U.S., Canada and France in August. In the UK, the adult incontinence category is growing double digits, roughly 50% faster since our entry. The U.S. category growth rate has also more than doubled to around 9%, with P&G value share exceeding 10% in the most recent four week period. We\u2019ve continued the expansion of Always Discreet with launches into Germany, Switzerland and Austria, with more European markets coming soon. A few of our leading brands are not growing like we know they can. We\u2019re bringing the same strategic focus in operating discipline to these brands that we have in the ones I\u2019ve just mentioned. Ensuring the brand strategies and business models are aimed at delighting the target consumer, building strong pipelines and portfolios of consumer meaningful product innovation, ensuring skew assortment and brand presence are attractive and easy to shop at shelves and ensuring that marketing and sales programs persuasively convey the value in relevant to our brands and product benefits to consumers. Another opportunity directly in our control is productivity. We\u2019ve made very good progress and have a lot of runway remaining. We have significantly accelerated and will significantly exceed the cost savings and overhead enrollment goals we set three years ago. We\u2019re driving cost of good savings well above the original target run rate of $1.2 billion per year, with $1.6 billion of savings this fiscal year. We expect to improve manufacturing productivity by 5% this year. This will bring cumulative as per year manufacturing enrollment reduction to 15% including new staffing necessary to support capacity additions. On a same site basis, enrollment was down nearly down 20% over this past three years enabled by technology in our integrated work systems approach. We expect to start up at least eighteen new plans or modules in the developing markets in the next few years. This will not only help our foreign exchange exposure, but will drive manufacturing, transportation and customs and duties saving. As we start up these new sites, we have opportunities to apply technology and automate in an affordable way and to close a couple and integrate further with supplier delivering additional manufacturing efficiencies. In developed markets, we began work on one of the biggest supply chain redesigned in the company\u2019s history. We\u2019re designing the supply chain to accelerate consumer preferred products in the market and to make industry with them in both the customer service preferred and cost advantage way. Supply chain transformation began with the distribution network in the United States consolidating customer shipments in the fewer company distribution centers. These distribution centers are strategically located closer to key customers and key population centers enabling 80% of the company\u2019s business to be within one day at the store shelf and the shopper. All six of the new distribution and mixing centers are up and running, all on or ahead of schedule. We expect to complete the conversion out of legacy [ph] occasions this year. In addition to lower cost, this transformation will allow both P&G and our retail partners to optimize inventory levels while improving service in on shelf availability. In February we announced that we will be constructing a new multi-category manufacturing facility in West Virginia, the next step in the North American supply chain redesigned. We\u2019ve taken the first steps in the transformation of our European supply chain. We recently announced the consolidation of distribution centers in France and the UK and the consolidation of manufacturing for some homecare products into our plant in Italy. We see a $1 billion to $2 billion value creation opportunity from the global supply chain reinvention effort. We\u2019re targeting to build $400 million to $600 million in annual cost savings in over five years and are expecting top line benefits for more effective customer service and reduction of out of stocks [ph]. This value and these savings are incremental to the $6 billion of cost of goods savings we originally communicated are on track to exceed. Through March, we\u2019ve reduced non-manufacturing our overhead enrollment by over 19%, nearly doubled the 10% reduction we initially envisioned when we launched our restructuring program. We continue to evolve the organization design so that it is business focused starting with consumers and costumers and so that it is simpler, more effective, more responsive and more efficient. We\u2019ve organized around industry based sectors, we\u2019re streamlining and de-duplicating the work of business units and selling operations. We\u2019ve consolidated four brand building functions into one. Each of these changes reduces complexity and each creates clear accountability for performance and results. A more focused portfolio of brands of businesses will enable further organization changes, which will be close to the high end of our estimated 16% to 22% non-manufacturing enrollment reduction range by the end of this fiscal year, more than a year ahead of plan with additional opportunity remaining. As a result we\u2019re increasing our overhead enrollment reduction target to 25% to 30% excluding divestitures by the end of fiscal 2017, reflecting additional opportunities we see. The third cost area where we continue to significant savings opportunity is marketing. By following the consumer, we\u2019re improving marketing spending effectiveness and efficiency to deliver more with less. We\u2019re shifting more advertising to digital media, social, video and mobile, we\u2019re just working, so we\u2019re just spending more of the time. One non-media cost area that offers significant opportunity is agency spending, which includes fees and production cost for agencies we use for advertising, media, public relations, packers design and development against raw materials. We plan to significantly simplify and reduce the number of agency relationships and the cost associated with the current complexity and inefficiency, while upgrading the agency capability to improve creative quality and communication effectiveness. We\u2019ve seen opportunity for up to $0.5 billion in cost savings in this area, along with stronger communication to consumers across all touch points. These efficiencies are enabling us to maintain strong media waves, despite the cost pressure we\u2019re facing from foreign exchange and to reinvest in all elements of the marketing mix to improve our positions and support new innovations. Like Always Discreet, Fusion FlexBall, Venus Swirl, Downy Unstopables and Tide, Gain and Ariel Unit Dose detergents.  Productivity driven cost savings continued to be a key enabler of our efforts to strengthen profitability in developing markets. Cost and currency earnings grew two times faster than sales in the wealthy markets in 2013, four times faster than sales in 2014 and are forecast to grow six times faster than sales this fiscal year. Over those three years we\u2019ve grown developing market constant currency earnings 13%, 28% and 27% respectively. In total we\u2019re forecasting developing market margins including FX to be up about 40 basis points for the year. We\u2019re focused on driving productivity improvement up and down the income statement and across the balance sheet. Disciplined working capital management, stronger execution of our supply chain financing program and a scarcity mentality in capital spending, we\u2019ll continue to drive strong cash flow results. With that let me turn to guidance. As we look to the April-June quarter, productivity savings should continue to grow. The benefits from portfolio strengthening and simplification should continue to build. Oil based commodity cost should become a tailwind and additional foreign exchange related pricing will kick in. With just one quarter remaining, we now expect organic sales growth of low single digits for the fiscal year. Pricing should be a significant contributor to sales growth again in the fourth quarter, which should more than offset pressure on unit volume growth. FX will continue to be a headwind and we will continue to invest in category leading established brands like Pampers, Tide and Gillette and product introductions like Always Discreet and Venus Swirl in R&D for future innovation and sales coverage and effectiveness and in capabilities and people that will enhance our chances of success in the near mid and long-term. We\u2019re maintaining our outlook for double digit constant currency core earnings per share growth for the fiscal year, we expect foreign exchange to have about a 13 point impact on core earnings per share growth for the year. We\u2019re maintaining our core earnings per share guidance range of in line to down and low single digits versus last year\u2019s core earnings per share of $4.09. With the current foreign exchange outlook we expect to be towards the lower half of this guidance range consistent with analyst consensus estimates. Our forecast in all-in sales to be down 5% to 6% for the fiscal year, this includes the 6 to 7 point negative impact from foreign exchange and a one impact from minor brand divestitures. We expect all-in GAAP earnings per share to be down 21% to 22% versus the prior fiscal year. This includes approximately $0.83 per share of non-core cost, primarily from $0.63 per share of non-cash adjustments that carry in values on the Duracell business and $0.20 per share of non-core restructuring charges. As you construct your fourth quarter earnings per share model, keep in mind that several of the minor brand divestitures I mentioned earlier are expected to close in the fourth quarter, altogether works back in about $0.04 per share of non-operating income gains in core earnings per share versus the prior year. Reflecting the same for activity focus for bringing the cost savings, we\u2019re now forecasting a 100% adjusted free cash flow productivity, above prior guidance of at least 90%. The enablers of this strong cash productivity include, improved results on payables, including continued progress on our supply chain financing program and steady improvement on inventory management. We\u2019re maintaining our outlook for cash return to shareholders. We plan to return cash to shareholders through dividend payments of more than $7 billion and share repurchase of approximately $5 billion. This guidance range assumes mid April spot rates for foreign exchange through this significant currency weakness including Venezuela is not anticipated within this guidance range. Our outlook is based on current market growth rates, which we are monitoring closely especially in markets where we\u2019re taking large price increases to offset currency impacts. We also continue to monitor on rest of the several markets in the Middle East, Russia and the Ukraine and we continue to closely monitor markets like Venezuela and Argentina, where pricing controls, import restrictions and access to dollars present risk. On the flip side our guidance does not reflect some potential tailwinds. Our results could improve if currencies ease, if markets begin to expand in a sustainable way or if U.S. economic growth accelerates. Stepping back, we\u2019re continuing to invest in our brands and products and in critical company capabilities that will enable much better consumer and customer responsiveness with systems that are more agile, faster, better and cheaper. We continue to invest strategically in additional capacity for critical developing market and we continue to rationalize our manufacturing processes to like common, simpler and more globally standard making the packing platforms, support accelerated product innovation and a lower cash, capital and operating cost. We continue to evolve the organization designs, so that it is business focused, starting with consumers and customers, simpler, more effective, more responsive and more efficient. We continue to invest selectively in sales coverage and merchandize into improved execution for shoppers and stores and online. We continue to invest selectively in product innovation technologies and product initiative acceleration. We\u2019re improving our digital and ecommerce capabilities and are reinventing in our supply chain. Through this transformation we\u2019re creating a more in touch, agile, coordinated and integrated organization that puts winning with the customer first. We\u2019re sharpening our strategies and business models who are operated in executing with more consistency. These are the choices and the capabilities that will enable balanced growth and value creation in the mid and long term as we work our way through the currency devaluations in the short term. That concludes our prepared remarks for this morning. As a reminder business segment information is provided in your press release and available in slides, which will be posted on our website www.pg.com following the call. I would be happy to take questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank. Bill Schmitz : Jon, good morning. Can you just talk about the first, the way this would [ph] impact the strong dollar. So what\u2019s going on in some of the emerging markets or some of the big price increases you take and then you look at some of the [indiscernible] in the U.S. and it\u2019s clearing categories like shampoo, where like your percentage of sales in ACB is massively spiking. L'Or\u00e9al is talking about seeking revenge, Henkel is launching Priscilla [ph] exclusively at Wal-Mart, so can you just like talk about what that has relative to your expectations in kind of how you plan to [indiscernible] that going forward? Thanks. Jon Moeller : Thanks, Bill. First I\u2019d say, it\u2019s still relatively early in the development of whatever that occurs here, but so far markets have held up fairly. As I said it\u2019s pretty really, so we really won\u2019t know the impacts in markets like Russia, Bill, the next quarter or the quarter after. Like you\u2019re seeing from several of the companies in the industry that are responded, in the last quarter the Russian market was actually up as they anticipated price increases come in. So again we have stream of second leg there. What I would broadly is that - and I\u2019ll get to the U.S. in a second, but in developing markets those currencies have devalued not just versus the dollar, but also versus the euro. If you take the case Russia, which I walked through in some detail on the last call, there is every reason for both local competitors and multinational competitors to be pricing in many of these markets and that\u2019s generally might be at early days what we\u2019re seeing. As it relates to the overall promotional environment, competitiveness, et cetera and reflecting specifically on the U.S., if we look at the percentage of volume that was sold on promotion in the January to March quarter, it indexes at a 100, so is identical to last year and if you look at it sequentially quarter-to-quarter there is very little change. That doesn\u2019t mean that it couldn\u2019t change, but that\u2019s the data thus far and that\u2019s consistent with the dynamics in our own business. Obviously by category, you mentioned hair care. We may see some more promotion in one quarter or another. There is obviously promotion as competitors and ourselves introduce new products and are trying to generate trial of those items. But to date there is nothing from either a developing market standpoint or developed market standpoint that would indicate systemic change. Operator : Our next question will come from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. DaraMohsenian: Hey good morning. Joe Moeller : Hi Dara. DaraMohsenian: So I just wanted to talk a little bit about EPS guidance and clearly you\u2019re keeping the EPS guidance here despite the FX head and organic sales coming in are now expected to come in a bit below, which you originally expected. Do you think you are stretching the organization here to hit these EPS targets? It seems like every year we\u2019ve got this hockey stick in Q4 earnings. You\u2019ve now got some gains coming through Q4 earnings and Q4 add spend has been down over the last few years and I know a lot of that is the external environment clearly macros are working against you, but I\u2019m just wondering if there is a thought process as you look at the next year in the earnings guidance that given some of this external volatility and some of the internal issues you might need to provide yourself more cushion room when you look at guidance versus what has been the case over the last few years here. Thanks. Jon Moeller : So you make a couple of good observations there Dara, let me try to address them holistically. In terms of forecast and guidance we\u2019re obviously into that and more specifics in August. We\u2019re just in the middle of our prep season right now. If all of us know amount of cushion that you can build in that overcomes this $1.5 billion of after tax foreign exchange cost the majority of which we\u2019re not anticipated based on spot markets as we went into the year and expected our budgets last year. But that doesn\u2019t mean, I agree with you point that we need to provide a sufficient room to invest in the business and frankly we\u2019ve not pulled off in that regard. We have continued to invest, as I tried to make clear in my remarks, in certain parts of the organization both R&D and sales, we continue to invest in our brand and product platforms. We continue to invest in the redesign of our supply chain. We\u2019ve continued to invest in new product launches and that\u2019s clearly going to continue through next quarter. I mean, we\u2019re just in the first quarter launches of things like Venus Swirl and Always Discreet and they had received full support. As well, for instance the laundry innovations that I briefly mentioned in the opening remarks. So what allows us if FX is going to continue to be a headwind and we\u2019re going to continue to invest, which we are, what allows us to deliver the fourth quarter number that as you rightly point out will be materially better than the first three quarters. We will have as I mentioned commodity cost tailwinds. We will have the full benefit of this year\u2019s productivity savings. Pricing for some of the currencies will begin to kick in. There will be a minor impact as we noted on a minor investor gains [ph]. But it\u2019s those items - look at the 410 basis points of productivity savings in this quarter and how we continue to invest in all the things I talked about. It\u2019s a continuation of that that should allow us to deliver. Philosophically I have no difference, I\u2019m completely aligning to what you\u2019re suggesting in terms of how we construct plans and budgets and I think our current plan of budget is constructed that way. Recall in the middle of the year we took earning per share guidance down. So we\u2019re not a slave to that. As I\u2019ve said many times, if I\u2019ve proven anything over the last six or seven years, it\u2019s that I\u2019m not constrained by guidance. So we\u2019ll continue investing, but we\u2019ll continue to deliver productivity savings as well and we\u2019re hopeful that we invest in right amounts of those in the top line. We\u2019ll get both the top-line and bottom-line growing at very attractive rates. Operator : We will now move on to John Faucher of JPMorgan. John Faucher : Thanks. Jon, can you talk a little bit about gross margin. You\u2019ve delivered gross margin expansion a couple of times now despite pretty weak top-line it seems like we might be seeing sort of one off mixed benefits from that standpoint in terms of less emerging markets or potentially grooming being better that\u2019s driving that. So can you talk to us about sort of the progression on gross margin as we look at over the next couple of quarters and do you need sort of one off things to happen within those quarters in order to get there? And what do you think is the rate of benefit coming from local manufacturing particularly in terms of lessening the mixed impact overtime? Thanks. Jon Moeller : So the biggest driver of gross margin by far - were the productivity savings of 250 basis points and that\u2019s not one time. It doesn\u2019t rely on certain categories growing faster than others. That\u2019s there, we\u2019ll maintain our increased path and I expect gross margin to continue to improve next quarter which will make it I think three quarters in a row, which again is some indication of the systemic improvement there. There was some benefit as you rightly mentioned from mix, which is frankly the developing and developed markets growing at closer rates to each other and if developing markets were to accelerate that mix benefit would be slightly \u2013mix hurt [ph] would be slightly increased. In terms of the benefit of local manufacturing that continues to build. It\u2019s part of the 250 basis points. I actually don\u2019t know exactly how that breaks out in terms of basis point improvement, but John and Katie [ph] can help you with that. But it\u2019s significant and as I mentioned we\u2019re making very good progress on developing market margins through that and other dynamics including positive mix developments as those market in some cases premiumlize [ph] and as I said, we\u2019re growing constant currency earnings ahead of constant currency sales growth 2X three years ago, 4X last year, 6X this year and that\u2019s a trend that should continue. Operator : You will now take a question from Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Olivia Tong : Thanks very much. Jon, with organic sales now having to accelerate a bit more, can you talk through some of the incremental big initiatives that need to be taken to drive improvements because it seems a bit too simple to say that getting out of some of the slower growing categories and the portfolio shift is going to be enough. I mean is there a function of consumers across a number of categories not just within HVC [ph], but across Staples sort of trading out of bigger brands and so potentially more niche you\u2019re offering here and there? Jon Moeller : Thanks Olivia. Our largest brands are our fastest growing brands. That\u2019s true over a five year period, over a three year period, over a one year period and was true last quarter. So I\u2019m not disputing the dynamic that you describe in terms of smaller brands impact in some categories. I think it\u2019s more probably, for example in some of the beverage categories and two categories. But any period of time we look at, convinces us that along with the intuitive benefits in big brand platforms in terms of innovation, importance to retailers et cetera, convinces us that this is a business model that will continue to work for us. In terms of, you mentioned organic sales acceleration I just want to put that in context a little bit. I really don\u2019t see significant deceleration. Let me explain that. We rounded up to two2 for the last two quarters. This quarter we rounded down to one. We\u2019re talking in very small differences quarter-to-quarter sequentially. I mentioned in my prepared remarks the impact that the time the expansion tax increase had in Japan. That item alone if you take that out of the results we would have rounded to two. My point is not that, that\u2019s a measure of victory or defeat. My point is simply that I don\u2019t see any systemic deceleration in the sales quarter-to-quarter. Portfolio as you rightly indicate will help from both the top-line and a bottom-line stand point. And you are absolutely right there is additional work on brands and in some markets we need to do to maximize growth and I mentioned those in my prepared remarks as well. We have work to do in Mexico though we\u2019re getting through that very nicely. We have work to do in China and as I mentioned China growth rates continue to be good, so that all looks pretty reasonable. And as you know from our results we have continued work to do on beauty some of which will be addressed through the portfolio and some of which we\u2019re currently making significant progress on. I think when you step back and I realize it\u2019s a little bit difficult to see and I certainly appreciate that, but we\u2019re really on track or ahead of everything we\u2019re trying to do to transform this company to a more sustainable, more reliable grower on both the top and bottom line and that gets lost in the messiness of execution if you will and frankly through the flog of FX currently. We\u2019re very happy with where we sit in terms of the progress we\u2019re making on both the portfolio and on the brands that are going to constitute the new company. Operator : And now we\u2019ll take a question from Chris Ferrara from Wells Fargo. Chris Ferrara : Hey, thanks. Jon, I guess I apologize in advance for kind of a long question, but inventory reductions and unprofitable promos right that you guys have been backing out I guess. I want to talk a little bit about. So can you revisit specifically the drivers of the weakness in Mexico because I know you\u2019re talking about consumption tax? I think there was some exiting of some unprofitable promotion. I think you\u2019re also citing some inventory reductions. So can you at least give more specifics, I guess around, how those issues are may be related and then for Mexico and for China, how long do these inventory corrections take? I know in China Unilever should have ripped the Band-Aid off and took a 20% hit. Do you have a defined strategy on this and how long will it drag and then just lastly are there any other markets where this stuff is happening may be just even on a smaller scale. Thanks. Jon Moeller : Thank Chris. Let me deal with Mexico first. In any of the developing markets, the supply chains from the manufacturer\u2019s door to a store are long and layered. China is an example; you\u2019re going through distributors wholesalers secondary wholesalers. And so when there is a significant change in market growth rate as there was in Mexico as a result of the consumption tax increase last year, as there have been in china as many of our competitors have reported, there is a lot of inventory in that system which needs to get drawn down. And you\u2019re not in complete control of how quickly that can be accomplished because you\u2019re not owning all of that inventory. But we\u2019re working our way through that. In Mexico, if you look at growth rates quarter-to-quarter it improved significantly on the order of magnitude of 10 points and we\u2019re expecting significant further improvement in AMJ. So I would say that one we are largely at least from a visibility horizon we see our way through that. China as I mentioned there is - if you look at consumption we\u2019re in a very good place in China in many categories. We are probably two quarters in through the inventory reduction that needs to occur that\u2019s largely consistent with what our competitors have reported as well. I would say we\u2019ve got another quarter or two to go there and then we have some structural work that we need to do. But as I said these are large developing markets with very complicated long layered supply chains and these are dynamics that are affecting the industry broadly, but once we\u2019re through them, it\u2019s back to business as normal and we compete on the basis of the strength of our products and brands and we feel very good about that. I would tell you Chris, that there are no other large issues like this that I\u2019m currently aware of. We will have to and we talked about this several times have to manage very carefully in some of the markets where our currency devaluation has been significant because those market sizes can change pretty significantly and we\u2019ll do that. Operator : And now we\u2019ll go to Wendy Nicholson of Citi. Wendy Nicholson : Hi, a couple of things. First of all just a follow up on China, I was listening to what you said and I guess I don\u2019t understand some of the other companies like Unilever and Colgate talked about destocking in China as of last summer if not earlier and now it\u2019s kind of only heading [indiscernible]. I\u2019m just curious, why does it seem that the timing is kind of unique to one manufacturer at a time that\u2019s just a follow up. But then the bigger question is from a volume growth perspective and kind of how it pertains to your kind of longer term growth algorithm. It just strikes me that we\u2019ve seen an enormous number of really big, may be not enormous, but order magnitude really big successful innovations from you over the last four quarters and yet we still haven\u2019t seen much volume growth. And so I know we\u2019re going to get into easier comps, but I sort of - it doesn\u2019t sound to me like the innovations are coming down the pike are as big as FlexBall or as big as Pods or Flings or what not. And so is there a change in your long-term outlook for how much of volume growth is going to contribute to the top line and plus when I promised just on the marketing budget I understand the idea of doing more with less, but given how competitive the market is and given how lower your volume growth is why wouldn\u2019t you choose to take some of those productivity savings and jut do more with more? Thanks Jon Moeller : Alright. First in terms of timing, different companies frankly have very different product mixes and they move through different distribution channels. So if you think about Unilever as a large food business in China it is very possible that they could have a different dynamic than the other channels and we\u2019re talking displacement of one quarter here or something like that. So that\u2019s that item. In terms of volume and initiatives, the biggest impact on volume has been the pricing before FX and that will continue until those markets recover or until that annualizes. But our innovations, if you look at the big ones that you mentioned, first they\u2019re contributing to both category growth and share growth. And category growth is a real indication of the strength of an innovation. Does it lift the entire category? And we\u2019ve seen that behind the things that I mentioned earlier and the good news is that those largely have been fully expanded in one market, the U.S. And we expand those globally we expect to see that same impact just like we did with all Always Discreet in both the UK and the U.S. for example. So we\u2019re pretty optimistic as we look forward about the strength of our innovation program and what that can do from the top line. We\u2019re going to have to continue to manage the volume impacts of FX, but we\u2019re really focused on the revenue number as the leverage to generate operating profit and cash and we\u2019re doing reasonably well there. On marketing, as I mentioned we are doing exactly what you would suggest we do Wendy, which is invest more where it makes sense to do that. And these innovations that I\u2019ve talked about are exactly one place where we\u2019re doing is just that and we\u2019ll continue to do that. I mean the investment behind the introduction of new brand in terms of Always Discreet you could imagine is significant and we\u2019re very happy with that because of the returns that we can generate and because of the impact that\u2019s had on those markets which are as I mentioned have doubled the growth rate versus the pre-entry period. So we\u2019re not talking here about construction on marketing dollars; what we are talking about is, being as efficient and effective as we can and spending those dollars where they drive returns. Operator : And we have a question from Steve Powers of UBS. Steve Powers : Hi, Jon. I just wanted to dig in to your comments on strategy a bit more. As you step back as you mentioned productivity efforts have been sizeable for a number of years and they seem to be running ahead of plan. You\u2019ve made significant shifts in how you\u2019re organizing now, how your portfolio is structured, but alongside that growth has been a struggle. And I think we\u2019d all acknowledge that the macro environment hasn\u2019t helped, but do you think there is a risk that all this inwardly focused change in operational improvement has actually impeded your efforts to execute on a larger strategy that you articulated namely uncovering consumer insights and driving consumer preferred innovations because it just seems like all these internal improvements are continually being offset by relative struggles in that external marketplace. I don\u2019t mean for this to be an unfair question, but I\u2019m just wondering what point its worth asking whether organic growth challenges may actually be exacerbated by all this internal change and whether improvement may have to, to some extent just wait until those internal projects run their course? Thanks. Jon Moeller : Thanks, Steve. That\u2019s actually a very good and very fair question and it\u2019s something that where we continue to be in active dialogue on here at P&G. We\u2019ve been very deliberate about the pace of some of the changes and ensuring that we have the capacity to execute, to serve consumers, to serve shoppers and do that in a more effective manner every day. So that\u2019s exactly the question that we ask ourselves. It\u2019s why, for example we said, we\u2019re going to take two years to complete the portfolio program as opposed to overnight. That we have the capacity to do that and deliver the business and so again I think you\u2019re asking the right question. It\u2019s one that we ask ourselves and we will make choices that maximize the total. That\u2019s one of the beauties of the metric that we\u2019re working against in terms operating TSR, it\u2019s an integrated metric, which strives choice and balance across both growth and value creation. You simply can\u2019t get there without one leg of that stool and the third leg being cash creation. So we\u2019re approaching this in a very holistic sense, very cognizant of the right question that you asked and are trying to get the balance right. As I indicated earlier we feel very good about where we are in terms of the progression against those strategic initiatives that you outlined and others including and the redesign of the supply chain. And most of our big brands and categories were growing fairly well. As I mentioned, if you look at grooming health care, baby care, family care and family care we grew at 9%, 6% and 2% respectively. So that\u2019s not an indication of any systemic pinch point if you will, where we haven\u2019t performed as well, as well it\u2019s more a function of an individual business dynamic. Operator : And now we\u2019ll move to Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Thanks, good morning. I thought a follow up I guess on that would - the idea of taking three years for the divestiture process. I mean to what degree was that creating or is it any disruption on - employees wonder I know about what things sold and when or retailers or competitors are kind of looking at the things that we can pounce on a business where we think that P&G deemphasizing. So what [indiscernible] did you think that may be actually weighing on organic [indiscernible]. The other thing was that Jon, in talking about how you feel good internally about the progress being made, is it, but a thin map, but messing of the execution. Maybe doesn\u2019t look a great word to it, but I feel like the one thing that P&G committed to three years ago was - nearly three years ago was, we will improve the execution. And that doesn\u2019t feel it\u2019s like happening, so whether it\u2019s an one off thing to pop up with China and Mexico there and honestly I\u2019m not convinced there won\u2019t be another big one off two or three quarters from now. So what is it that has or hasn\u2019t changed that on cote-on-cote execution in the market? Thanks. Jon Moeller : Let me tackle the last one first. It was a poor word choice. I should have said, the chunkiness of execution. Frankly, we\u2019ve been very intentional in the focus on improving execution. I feel very good about the progress that we\u2019re making there. So I apologize for that word choice. But there are just big chunks moving in and out as we make these very big transformational moves, which can flatter things up a little bit. In terms of organic sales growth and the portfolio impact, if you look at the businesses, take Duracell as an example, which is we\u2019re currently working to transition to butcher a half away. But the entire period of the business was working on that project, leading up to the signing of the deal and post the signing of the deal, managing through transition. That business has held up extremely well, building market share. I won\u2019t go into the details, but several of the other businesses that we\u2019re looking to sell are also performing very well. In other words, growth rates were above the 100 index versus year ago. So I think we\u2019ve got about the right balance in terms of the pace at which we\u2019re moving and the work to be done. As I said, it\u2019s something that we relook every day, but it\u2019s not major concern at this point. Operator : And now we have a question from Nik Modi of RBC Capital Market. Nik Modi : Yeah, good morning guys. So just few quick ones from me. Jon, some in the media world would suggest that P&G has taken its marketing mix too digital heavy, so I just wondered if you could respond to that and your perspective around that. And then the second question is, in your prepared remarks you indicated [indiscernible] rationalization will take place in the core portfolio over the next couple of years, if I heard that I right. Just curious how we should think about that and its impact on organic revenue growth as we look out the next couple of years, I mean I know you\u2019re not giving guidance, but just how should we kind of think about it from a magnitude standpoint? Jon Moeller : These are skews are at the long far tail in terms of productivity. So we have businesses that are less than 1% of the sales and the same is true with profit. So I think if anything by removing the clutter by allowing us to focus on product lines and skews that really matter to consumers and customers that should have a positive impact on the top-line, not a negative. These are itches in some cases, but they\u2019re meaningful in terms of the amount of complexities that they create. That\u2019s true in our operations, that\u2019s true at the shelf, that\u2019s true in the warehouse. In terms of our approach to digital versus prudential media, we viewed this very much as an and, not an or, they complement each other. So we look at it very holistically. We\u2019ve guided in our choice by two things, one is where consumers are spending their time in terms of consumption of media. We need to be reasonably in step with that and the second is, depending on the category, what media they want to interact with and learn about our products on. And that\u2019s different across categories. So we\u2019re going to be guided, as in everything we do by the consumer and if we stay with that approach we\u2019ll probably not stray too far from what\u2019s right. Operator : And we\u2019ll move to Javier Escalante of Consumer Edge Research. Javier Escalante : Good morning, everyone. Jon, I have to say that I\u2019m still having a hard reconciling the top-line growth of 1%, with your positive remarks about some of your big brands Pampers. The flip side of the response that you gave to Olivia earlier is that you\u2019re basically are telling the investors that Proctor performance in the past quarters had been actually weaker and organic sales only around up to two. Shouldn\u2019t you be considering a bigger portfolio change or a breakup even, given that sectors like beauty are not only getting more fragmented and smaller than any food and beverages categories that you alluded earlier and instead of reducing SKU\u2019s by 15% and 20% as Nik just said, what you\u2019re going to have is split up [ph] top-line growth for the next two years. Thank you Jon Moeller : We\u2019re going to try to have fullest ability on the portfolio moves by the summer and I think we\u2019ll be in a position then to articulate why we think these are the right moves and so I\u2019m going to save that conversation for that point in time. But we\u2019re being federal [ph] in our approach across each of the categories and brands. There\u2019s no business that we haven\u2019t objectively analyzed and so I think we\u2019re going to end up in a pretty good place in that regard. In terms of - look on this whole thing of small brands and fragmentation. One, our data doesn\u2019t support that being an issue from most of the businesses that we\u2019re going to maintain. Second, where differentiated performance matters and where differentiated performance is delivered, this dynamic does not remain. So for example, and I\u2019ll bring it to beauty in a second Javier, but if you think about Pampers as an example, I can\u2019t think of a new mother who would be asking herself, where performance really matters, would be asking herself, what\u2019s the new diaper that nobody\u2019s ever tried before or where I can discover the next diaper? That\u2019s not the thought process. There\u2019s a job that needs to be done, there\u2019s a brand that has proven over decades, it can do the job, it can do it better than the other offerings that are out there and it\u2019s offered at a price that creates a good value. If you think about performance and where performance matters in a beauty context, think about anti dandruff shampoos. I\u2019ve got a problem, I need a solution. This is not time to experiment, this is time to solve. Head & Shoulders has been solving dandruff issues for decades. It\u2019s a brand that consumers know and trust and it\u2019s offered at a reasonable value. So I think we have to think about the specific dynamics of a category, the consumer approach to the category, the relevance of innovation of the category and differential performance as a driver of purchase before we make broad conclusions about whether fragmentation is going to occur or not. In terms of your question on split up, again let\u2019s wait until we have the portfolio in front of us and talk about it at that point. We\u2019re very bullish and again this is not just based on what we think is going to happen. This is based on 10, 5, 3 and 1 years of data which is very consistent and its outcome. And these are categories that we have long track records of winning in, where we\u2019re typically the market leader with brands and other prototypes in those category. Operator And next we have Joe Altobello with Raymond James. Q - Joe Altobello Hi, this is Christine on for Joe. I just wanted to change the topic quickly and go to commodity costs and whether you\u2019re still expecting that to be a $500 million to $700 million tail end next year. And how much of that do you actually expect to recover out of pricing. Thanks. Jon Moeller : Our current estimate would be more than the order magnitude to $600 million to $800 million of BT commodity cost savings next fiscal year. Really don\u2019t have a point of view yet on how much of that we\u2019ll be able to take to the bottom-line as opposed to past proven price. So if you just reflect on the dynamics in the industry, this is an industry that, with the exception of some international competitors who have FX tailwinds is challenged from a profit growth stand point and that\u2019s a dynamic that generally supports or using this saving as a way to help that situation. So we\u2019re hopeful that many of these will come to the bottom line, but that\u2019s something that we\u2019ll have to see as we move forward. Operator : Your next question will come from Ali Dibadj of Bernstein Ali Dibadj : Hi guys. Jon, I mean you\u2019re getting the same question from many folks over and over again and I\u2019m not sure the message is necessarily clear which is, we\u2019ve been hearing a lot of promise that help us round the corner for years, years and every back half of the year you kind of limp across the finish line. If not just this year and I guess, for me at least I just wonder whether P&G has the right to be consistently in a short-term optimist at least given its recent track record. And now the promise is wait till we break up 14% of sales, 6% operating profit out of our business, things will be much better, but at that point how much longer would we have to wait for you guys to decide that maybe something even bigger has to happen, maybe you really got to rebase your guidance and you shouldn\u2019t be delivering double digit EPS growth, maybe you really have to break up the company even further? I think there\u2019s a lot of frustration in terms of trying to see the logs grant to the macro stuff, grant to the FX, but others have that too. How much longer do we wait I guess is really the core question and especially after this next promise divestitures, how much longer do we have to wait after that? Thanks. Jon Moeller : The last year you mentioned FX, I think you\u2019re right to mention that excluding FX we grew 14% on the bottom-line, this year will grow double digits. I think it\u2019s pretty clear that the operating improvements that we are making, productivity and otherwise are coming through. And if it weren\u2019t for FX, we would be having a very different discussion right now. We do have brands and businesses where we need to continue to strengthen the top-line, we\u2019re cognizant of that, I mentioned that and that kind of is what it is. We look at the change that we\u2019re in the middle of executing. It\u2019s probably the biggest transformation this company has gone through across the totality of portfolio, supply chain, organization, structure and design and as I said, it\u2019s hard to see that all come together at this point, but each of the pieces, we\u2019re very happy with the progress and we\u2019ll see. Operator : Your final question will comes from the desk of Caroline Levy of CLSA. Caroline Levy : Good morning, thanks so much. Just a question about beauty again, Olay and Pantene are different from Head & Shoulders because there\u2019s not this clear need and promise and delivery. So if you just look at Olay and the performance. I know China has been very problematic, but around the world, why do you think P&G really should be in that passive business? Jon Moeller : Well, First of all Caroline, younger looking skin I think is a real need. It\u2019s increasingly a need of mine. If you count [ph] my hair care need and I\u2019m not going to comment on specific businesses that we are going to be in or out. Again we\u2019ll do that when we\u2019re ready to do that, but that\u2019s a business where function and performance, differentiated performance does matter. It\u2019s what enabled us to build one of the largest, the largest facial skin care brand in the world and continues to have incredibly strong equity and frankly is growing significantly in many parts of the world where we haven\u2019t cluttered the equity in the shelves as badly as we for instance in the U.S. and China. I was just a couple of weeks ago in the Gulf, in the Middle East and that\u2019s a market where the brand architecture is much cleaner and clear and that business is growing double digits. Something is true in the UK and Olay, we\u2019re again - we haven\u2019t cluttered either the messaging the equity or the shelf. So skin care is clearly - and SK II as an example, that delivers a clear benefit that\u2019s coveted by women particularly in Asia. So it\u2019 not a business that is all about fashions and style, it\u2019s a business that\u2019s about performance. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc. William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research LLC Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Operator : Good morning, and welcome to Procter and Gamble's Quarter End Conference Call. Today's discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections. As required by Regulation G, P&G needs to make you aware that during the call the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Management believes these measures provide investors valuable information on the underlying growth trends of the business. Organic refers to reported results excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange where applicable. Adjusted free cash flow represents operating cash flow less capital expenditures and excluding tax payments for the pet care divestiture. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings adjusted for impairment charges and Venezuela charges. Any measure described as core refers to the equivalent GAAP measure adjusted for certain items. Currency neutral refers to the equivalent GAAP measure excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate changes. P&G has posted on its website, www.pg.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP and other financial measures. Now I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller. Jon R. Moeller - Chief Financial Officer : Good morning. As you know, earlier this week, we announced that David Taylor had been elected and appointed as the new Chief Financial Officer of the company, which becomes effective November 1. And sorry, Chief Executive Officer. And so joining me this morning is A.G. Lafley. I'm going to start a discussion with a review of the fiscal year and fourth quarter results. Then A.G. will discuss our business strategy and ongoing moves to transform the company, and I'll close with guidance for fiscal 2016. One reminder before we begin, unless noted otherwise, the organic sales and core earnings results we're reporting today continue to include the beauty categories that we're in the process of exiting. The results of these businesses will be recorded as discontinued operations starting with the first quarter of fiscal 2016. In September, we'll provide an informational 8-K presenting historical results of these businesses as discontinued operations. Another important accounting item to point out before we get started is the decision we've made to move from consolidation accounting to cost method accounting for Venezuela in our GAAP financial statements. While this decision is effective for periods beginning July 1, it entails a one-time non-core write down of fixed assets, cash and receivables of about $2.1 billion, or $0.71 per share that's reflected in our fourth quarter 2015 numbers. We're committed to continue to serve Venezuelan consumers. The change we've made to our accounting simply reflects our continued inability to convert currency or pay dividends. Now on to our discussion of 2015 results. We accomplished four things in 2015. First, we delivered strong double-digit constant currency core earnings per share growth and very good free cash flow productivity, over 100% on modest organic top line growth. Second, we continue to make strong productivity gains across the board, income statement and balance sheet, with many more opportunities still in front of us. Third, we largely completed the reshaping of our portfolio in less than one year, refocusing on 10 categories and 65 brands that best leverage our core competencies with leading global positions and historically superior top and bottom line performance. This positions us over time for stronger top and bottom line growth. Fourth, we continue to invest in our future and more dedicated selling resources, in product innovation and brand building, and in transforming our supply chain. For the fiscal year, organic sales grew 1%. Excluding the businesses we're in the process of exiting, organic sales grew 2%. All in sales were down 5%, including the 6 point headwind from foreign exchange. When we had to make choices between the top and bottom line, for example, the price for foreign currency rather than shift volume at a negative gross margin, or to continue unprofitable non-strategic product lines, we've deliberately placed emphasis on driving value creation and cash. Core operating margin was 19.3%, in line with the prior year despite 130 basis point challenge from foreign exchange. On a constant currency basis, core operating margin was up 130 basis points. Productivity savings contributed approximately 330 basis points to core operating margin expansion for the year. Core gross margin, including foreign exchange, grew 30 basis points. On a constant currency basis, core gross margin was up 80 basis points. We delivered this margin and progress while making important investments in the business. As I mentioned earlier, we've increased investments in sales coverage. We're investing in innovation, in the upstream innovation pipeline and behind recent launches, PODS, beads, Pampers Pants, Gillette FlexBall and Venus Swirl, launches which both create and build markets. We're investing in the supply chain including the start-up of six new US mixing and distribution centers. We invested in a new business with our market expanding entry into the adult incontinence category. Core earnings per share for the year were $4.02, down 2% versus the prior year. This includes a 13 point headwind from foreign exchange, over $1.5 billion after tax. On a constant currency basis, core earnings per share grew at a double digit 11% rate. On an all in GAAP basis, earnings per share were (6:12) $2.44. This includes non-core restructuring costs, battery business impairment charges and the Venezuela charge. We continue to be one of the strongest cash generators among competitive peers in comparable mega-cap companies. We generated $11.6 billion in adjusted free cash flow with 102% adjusted free cash flow productivity, increasing our dividend for the fifty-ninth consecutive year and returning $11.9 billion in cash to shareholders, $7.3 billion in dividends and $4.6 billion in share repurchase, 105% of adjusted net earnings. Over the past five years, we've returned $60 billion to shareholders, $12 billion a year on average, and intend to pay dividends, retire and repurchase shares worth up to $70 billion over the next four years. Two important drivers of our strong cash generation have been a reduction in payables from the broad implementation of our supply chain financing program and our work to reduce inventory levels. Inventory days on hand are down 5 days on a constant currency basis, 7 days all in. Moving from the fiscal year to the quarter, organic sales grew modestly, rounding down to a level that was equal to the prior year. Organic sales of our 10 core product categories grew 1%. The quarter was also heavily impacted by 1 full point from market dynamics in Russia. All in sales were down 9%, including a 9 point headwind from foreign exchange. Core gross margin and core operating margin both improved, on both an all in and ex-currency basis driven by productivity savings. Core gross margin increased 110 basis points for the year. Excluding foreign exchange, core gross margin was up 130 basis points. Cost savings of approximately 220 basis points, pricing benefits of 140 basis points, and 40 points for lower commodity costs more than offset 170 points of mix. Core SG&A costs as a percentage of sales increased 10 basis points, as 130 basis points of productivity savings were more than offset by reinvestments in dedicated sales coverage and in our innovation pipeline by foreign exchange and other impacts. Core operating margin was 18.1%, up 90 basis points versus the prior year. On a constant currency basis, core operating margin was up 130 basis points. Productivity savings contributed 350 basis points to margin expansion for the quarter. Non-operating income was $300 million, above year-ago levels driven by gains from minor brand divestitures. The core effective tax rate was 19% for the quarter, 21% for the fiscal year, consistent with our outlook. Core earnings per share were $1, up 8% versus the prior year. This includes a 14 percentage point foreign exchange headwind, roughly $370 million after tax. On a constant currency basis, core earnings per share grew 22%. Excluding the non-operating income gains versus last year, constant currency core earnings per share was up 12% for the quarter. On an all in GAAP basis, earnings per share were $0.18 for the quarter. This includes $0.07 of non-core restructuring costs, $0.04 of earnings loss from discontinued operations, and the $0.71 per share Venezuela charge. We generated $2.9 billion in adjusted free cash flow, yielding 106% adjusted free cash flow productivity. The strong constant currency earnings growth and cash flow has been driven by our progress on productivity. As of July 1, we've reduced non-manufacturing overhead roles by 22%, more than double the original target set in February 2012 and a year earlier than planned. We're currently targeting a 25% to 30% cumulative reduction by the end of fiscal 2017. This excludes role reductions from divested businesses which would increase this figure to over 35%. We generated $1.5 billion of cost of goods savings in fiscal 2015, contributing 200 basis points of gross margin improvement. We improved manufacturing productivity by 5%, bringing cumulative past three year manufacturing enrollment reductions to 15%. This includes new staffing necessary to support capacity additions. On a same site basis, manufacturing enrollment is down nearly 20% over the past three years, enabled by technology and our integrated work systems approach. We're still in the early stages of our supply chain transformation. In fiscal 2015, we completed the construction and start-up of six new distribution and mixing centers, all on or ahead of schedule and under budget. We expect to complete the conversion out of our legacy locations later this calendar year. We announced the construction of a new multi-category manufacturing facility in West Virginia and a major expansion to an existing manufacturing site in Utah. Several plant closures were also announced, all early steps in the resiting and replatforming of our North American manufacturing system. We're taking similar steps in the European supply chain. We announced the consolidation of distribution centers in France and the UK and consolidation of manufacturing for some home care products at our plant in Italy. We continue to see a $1 billion to $2 billion value creation opportunity from the global supply chain reinvention effort. We're targeting to build over time to annual savings of $400 million to $500 million and are expecting additional top line benefits from customer service enhancements and reductions of out of stocks. Marketing spending is another area where we are delivering more, greater reach, higher frequency, more advertising for less overall cost. The savings are coming primarily from non-working marketing spend. One example are the fees and production costs for agencies we use for advertising, media, public relations, package design, and development of in-store materials. We're simplifying and reducing the number of agency relationships while upgrading agency capability to improve creative quality and communication effectiveness all at a lower cost. Our overall agency costs in fiscal 2015 were down about 15% versus the prior year. In Brazil, we consolidated agencies and delivered a 50% reduction in spending. In US hair care, we reduced the number of shopper and consumer marketing agencies by a third and lowered total agency spending by 20%. In another beauty category, we consolidated to a single global agency for digital marketing, reducing spending for these services by more than 75%. In total, we reduced the number of agencies by nearly 40% and cut agency and production spending by about $300 million versus the prior year. Tier 2, there's more savings ahead of us, most of which will be reinvested in stronger advertising programs. Moving from productivity to portfolio, as I mentioned at the onset, we've made excellent progress on plans to strengthen and focus our business and brand portfolio. On this call last year, we said we were targeting to become a company of about a dozen product categories comprised of 70 to 80 brands over a two-year period. At the CAGNY conference in mid-February, we updated plans to focus on 10 product categories and about 65 brands. With the beauty brands merger with Coty announced earlier this month, we have essentially completed the strategic portfolio reshaping. We've completed the decision making, negotiation and contracting work on businesses that represent 95% of in scope sales and essentially all of the in scope profit. At the close of the beauty brands merger a year or so from now, we will have focused our portfolio on 10 categories and 65 brands that best leverage our core competencies. We have leading global positions in these categories with consumer-preferred products and leading brands in the largest markets. These businesses and brands have historically grown faster and have been more profitable than the balance. As we're able to focus all of our energy on these leading businesses, which benefit from our core strengths, and as we invest productivity savings and profitable growth, we expect to improve both top and bottom line performance. With that, I'll turn it over to A.G. Alan G. Lafley - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Jon, and good morning everyone. This morning we're going to talk about the choices we've made, are making and will continue to make to drive growth and value creation as measured by operating total shareholder return. Every choice we take, every move we make is intended to accomplish one of three things : increase shopper and consumer preference for P&G brands and products, improve operational effectiveness and executional excellence, develop more balanced, reliable, sustainable growth and value creation. We are rebalancing and refocusing this company to reinvigorate it and accelerate growth in value creation. We use zero-based goals and strategies, reorganization, core capabilities, and the systems required to win. At P&G we are successful when we win with shoppers and consumers when we provide consumer-preferred brands and products that become leading value creators in their categories of business. The best, most balanced and integrated measure of value creation is operating total shareholder return. A foundation building block of OTSR is operating cash flow. Cash is the financial life blood of any company. Strong cash flow enables both reinvestment in the business and significant returns to share owners. The second building block is operating margin and profit. Our operating margins have begun to improve. They should continue to improve as we move into the 10 core category 65 brand portfolio and as we continue to deliver a steady stream of consumer-preferred product innovation and consistent productivity savings through the end of this decade. The third and last building block is net sales growth. Our results here obviously have been mixed. But we are making steady progress in most of the core business units. And we have detailed improvement and growth plans in place for the balance. Much of the sales growth is ahead of us. We have a strong lineup of new and improved products that are coming to market over the next one, two and three fiscal years. We believe more of the resulting sales growth will be sustainable. And we are learning that big obvious consumer meaningful product innovations can continue to grow sales profitably for three, five, seven and more years. The strength of OTSR is its actionability. It helps us prioritize business strategy choices, translate those choices to business building blocks and action plans that can be executed on a category and brand, country and customer, or even manufacturing plant sales rep or distributor basis. Operating TSR correlates with market TSR over time and aligns the interests of employees and share owners. The question for any company is not what businesses we are in but what businesses should we be in for the foreseeable future. As Jon said we chose 10 category-based business units where P&G has leading market positions, strong brands and consumer meaningful product technologies from which we can grow and create value, Baby, Feminine and Family Care, Fabric and Home Care, hair, skin, Grooming, oral and personal healthcare. These 10 categories have been growing 50 to 100 basis points faster than the total company. Their operating margins are up to 100 basis points higher. Where sales and profits are highly concentrated in a few big countries around the world, which makes the current business easier to operate. Yet every business unit, every category still has significant value creation opportunity in both our home US market and other big developed markets, Germany, Japan, et al., and in growing developing markets, the BRIC countries, Mexico, Turkey et al., markets where P&G has been continually improving its position. These categories and brands will continue to play to P&G's core strengths, shopper and consumer understanding, brand building and product innovation, productivity and go-to-market execution, and leveraging where appropriate and where it makes sense, the scale and scope of the company. As category leaders, we have the responsibility to create, occasionally transform and build these categories year in and year out. About two-thirds of all sales growth comes from category growth, and about half of that is driven by the manufacturer. That's us. The balance one-third comes from share growth and M&A. I want to take a few minutes this morning to report where we stand in each of the 10 category business units. First, Baby, Feminine and Family Care. After a drop-off in performance, both baby and family care delivered solid double digit OTS results in fiscal year 2015. And feminine care as you know, we have decided to invest in the Always Discreet entry into the incontinence category. Family care is excellent example of balanced, disciplined application of OTSR. It's a big, important North America business that got back on its proven business model and continued to improve structural economics while growing sales and market share at customers representing more than 90% in sales and profits, and focusing on the profitable premium care tissue business in Mexico, while de-emphasizing conventional lower value tissue products. With leading brands like Bounty and Charmin, consumer-preferred product innovation coming to market this summer and early next calendar, both on P&G's unique and proprietary technology and an operating discipline that relentlessly drives out costs and keeps the consumer value equation competitive, we expect another solid performance in fiscal 2016. Baby and fem care results have been more mixed. Very strong in North America where half of worldwide profit is made, mixed in Europe, weak in China. Pampers and Always brands are leaders in these categories with strong equities, household penetration that's growing and strong Net Promoter Scores. The focus in baby and fem is winning with consumer-preferred product innovation. These are categories where consumers notice and expect performance with every single product usage experience. We've invested significantly in R&D, new plants and equipment and will be investing in product sampling and trial, marketing, selling and sourcing as we accelerate consumer-preferred, better performing products to market. And next generation of Pampers Pants and the premium taped diaper line are going to market in China and the US as we speak, achieving the same share of the faster growing pants segment as we have on taped diapers over the next few years could be worth as much as $2 billion to $3 billion in sales over time. Over the next one to two years, there will be a steady drum beat of product upgrades across Pampers and Luvs in North America, Always and Always Discreet, every one of them consumer-preferred, several unique and proprietary. We continue to be encouraged by the progress we're making on Always Discreet. Category growth has accelerated 50% to 100% to 10% plus growth rates in the US, UK and France, though launched less than a year ago. Discreet's share has reached 7% to 9% in these markets. Importantly we are attracting new women to the category. Recall, women are not satisfied with current product offerings that don't work very well. Discreet pads and pants deliver better fit and significantly better protection from an Always brand women trust. Product ratings and reviews, product usage satisfaction and repeat rates are all strong. With still an ample awareness and trial opportunity ahead of us, we will continue to invest in marketing, sales and consumer-preferred product innovation in this new category. Fabric and Home Care has been a tale of two cities from an operating TSR standpoint. Home care, Duracell and our $1 billion B2B Professional products business have all delivered strong value creation for now several years in a row. We expect this to continue because each category continues to adapt proven business strategies and models and operates with discipline to deliver balanced growth and value creation across all three OTSR drivers. In fiscal 2015, modest sales growth and strong profit growth and cash productivity resulted in another very solid year for home care. We carefully pick our spots in the home care category and segment. We have leading brands and consumer-preferred products. We continue to strengthen marketing and selling fundamentals while we improve productivity and structural economics. Duracell, in a year of significant transformation as we stand up an independent company with Marmon and Berkshire Hathaway, delivered a fourth consecutive year of strong operating TSR and market share growth, while divesting the more commodity-like low tier battery business in China. P&G Professional is a very focused jewel that delivered its sixth straight year of strong industry-leading OTSR results. PGP has a unique and proven business model that delivers superior service and value to its customers and delivers consistently for share owners. Fabric Care has been more challenging as we've talked, because it has involved a significant transformation of strategy and business model, capabilities and operations, and execution across a number of important markets starting with the ., the largest and most profitable market in the world, where we have had to get the category growing again and rekindle household penetration and share growth. We've gotten the strategy back in balance, sharpened our business model, and have been operating with consistency and excellence. We exited unattractive segments like bleach, unprofitable laundry additives, cheap low tier powders, and we invested significantly in consumer-preferred products. We've constructed new manufacturing in the last two years to enable the expansion of premium products like PODS and beads and concentrated heavy-duty liquids not only for the US, Europe and Japan but also for big developing markets like China and Brazil. We've stimulated category growth in the adjacent fabric conditioner category, the fastest-growing household products category over the last two years as reported by Kantar, and we have grown share behind the Downy and Lenor brand equities and innovative new products. With leading brands Tide and Gain and Ariel, Downy and Lenor, consumer-preferred products, and much more robust structural economics, we're looking forward to more balanced and more consistent growth and value creation in fabric care starting this year. These segments help Grooming and Beauty. These segments again as we have talked, are a tale of three cities. Oral care delivered another strong year of OTSR behind 4% organic sales and 10% profit growth with strong cash productivity. Oral care has evolved successfully to a well-differentiated business strategy, and has been steadily improving structural economics. We've clearly defined the strategic goals for Crest and Oral-B. We've expanded Oral-B toothpaste into over 40 countries, and continue to grow this business by over 20% in its sixth year since launch. We've created two strong premium-priced properties in Pro-Health and 3D White, each now above $1 billion in sales. We just launched Crest Pro-Health HD in the US, a unique and proprietary super-premium two-step toothpaste system that is off to a very strong start. We have another strong $1 billion business in Oral-B Power Brush, which grew double digits in fiscal 2015 and actually doubled off a relatively small base in China. There's still a lot of upside in the power brush segment as household penetration is very low. We're developing a business model that drives consumer trial and accelerates Oral-B growth. Personal healthcare has evolved to a very focused niche player in OTC. It turned in another very solid year of operating TSR behind 4% organic sales and 5% profit growth, and again strong cash productivity. Vicks, our $1 billion OTC brand grew sales double digits and profit a strong double digits behind its premium-priced cough/cold product line SEVERE. The Meta wellness initiative grew sales 15% and significant market share, and our new VMS brands, New Chapter and Swisse, are both off to a good start in lead markets. The Grooming business, as you know, is undergoing significant change, the biggest of which may be consumer habits and practices. This is no longer just a facial shave care business. It's becoming a broader grooming business, face and body. But still, the vast majority of sales and profits are in shaving. Grooming had a challenging year due to unprecedented FX impacts, significant trade inventoried stocking, especially in economically challenged countries like Brazil and Russia, changes in grooming fashions and habits, and the continuing growth of online competitors in some markets like the US. Despite the challenges, Gillette eked out modest sales and share growth and began to stimulate more category growth behind the Gillette FlexBall and Venus Swirl consumer-preferred product innovations. Both are off to a strong start and continue to roll out around the world. In the first year in North America alone, 15 million men have tried a FlexBall razor. Gillette's online Shave Club is off to a very good start. We're building partnerships with e-tailers and retailers who are offering their shoppers subscription tie-ins for the Gillette Shave Club. Importantly, we are helping retail customers move out of the lock boxes on shelves and at checkout and into much more shopper friendly cost and shrink-effective hard tags. This innovative in-store solution is better for shoppers and for retailers. And in the first several hundred stores, it's significantly improving in-stock and sales off-take. We'll be rolling out hard tags as fast as we can in the year ahead with our retail partners. Finally, we continue to replatform manufacturing to significantly improve productivity and accelerate the expansion of new product innovation. We've already announced and will begin shipping the next major new cartridge innovation on Gillette for men in January 2016. Turning to hair care, we've repositioned hair care for growth. As you know, we're exiting the salon service and retail colorants businesses. We've sold off small non-strategic brands like Fekkai and Wash & Go. We've invested significantly in product innovation and technology, brand building and sales, and we've importantly in a big way strengthened the structural costs and cash productivity in this business. Hair care had a challenging year, but progress is being made. Head & Shoulders grew global organic sales mid single digits for the twentieth year in a row and continued to build profit and cash value creation. Pantene modestly grew sales worldwide but importantly delivered 4% sales and modest market share growth in the US for the first time in several years. Pantene's 3 Minute Miracle conditioner product initiative is being expanded right now. More importantly, once in a decade, new shampoo and conditioner product innovations built on unique and proprietary technologies will begin to go to market this summer and continue to expand around the world over the next two years on Pantene, Head & Shoulders, and as appropriate on the local and regional brands in the portfolio like Herbal, Vidal, et al. P&G's remaining hair care portfolio consists of brands with real consumer equity. These brands will not only benefit from better performing products but also from more focus, better packaging, marketing and sales execution. As sales continue to pick up, the OTSR leverage will be significant, with operating margins now 50% higher than leading competitors and superior structural economics continuing to improve. Skin care and personal care, as you know, have been mixed bag. SK-II, our $1 billion super-premium skin care brand grew organic sales mid single digits and profits very strong double digits while executing its proven trial-building business model. Despite strong sales growth and very attractive margins, the SK-II team continues to sweeten the mix and improve the structural economics of this very unique business. The deodorants business behind Old Spice and Secret continues to grow steadily, organic sales high single digits and profit high single digits, leading to solid OTSR. In personal cleansing, we sold off Camay and Zest and narrowed our brand product line focus to Olay and Safeguard and to a handful of key countries. Across the above segments, we continue to improve structural economics and cash productivity. Operating margins are improving and free cash flow remains strong, above 100%. This is important because these three businesses are where the lion's share of the profit and cash are made. On Olay, we are committed to return to sales growth and to continued value creation growth in North America in fiscal 2016. We're back on our masstige strategy. We've narrowed our boutique and product line focus to Regenerist and Total Effects and new products consumers like, like Luminous, which has attracted new consumers and has been growing sales and market share. Right now, we're transforming the shopping experience with more streamlined assortments and easier-to-shop shelf presentations where at test retailers, category and Olay sales have both increased. The qualified new Olay brand campaign will break in the fall behind increased effective support across all relevant media. We're making progress in every one of our 10 core category businesses, albeit at different paces and never as much as we want. Each business is different with different opportunities and challenges, but better defined and proactively addressed. P&G performs best when we stay in balance, balanced across industries and categories, balanced across developed and developing markets, balanced in our need to deliver the near term with our need to invest and deliver the mid and long term. OTSR is clearly helping with a focus on balanced growth and value creation. Just as with the company, getting the business unit portfolio right matters. Many of our categories found themselves over-expanded or over-extended and have had to divest or otherwise dispose of non-strategic and under-performing businesses. The recent divestitures, as Jon said, representing about 5% of profits, 15% of sales and as much as a reduction of 40% to 50% in complexity, P&G and its 10 core categories are becoming much simpler businesses, easier to operate, easier to grow, easier to create value creation from. We're picking up the pace, not only of portfolio streamlining but also of core business turnaround. We've invested significantly in R&D, plant and equipment, branding and marketing, sales and sourcing. All of this has been enabled by productivity that will continue strong through the end of this decade. Going forward, productivity efforts will be more focused on specific business units, countries, functions and on the major marketing and trade spending pools Jon talked about earlier. Despite our sense of urgency and substantial investment, the breadth, scope and scale of the transformation underway will continue to see cash productivity, operating profit and sales growth unfold over time. But the progress will be steady, year by year, delivering balanced, reliable, sustainable growth and value creation as measured by OTSR. When you're building brands and businesses to last for decades, growth does not happen in a straight line. Even the strongest of brands hit flat spots. But when we get back to basics, the fundamentals, putting the consumer front and center, delivering consumer-preferred brands and products, executing with excellence, we put ourselves in a position to win year after year, decade after decade, successful brand building and product innovation, transformed and grown categories and created value for consumers, for P&G and its shareowners. The key going forward will be the robustness of our category business strategies and models, the strength of our brand and product differentiation and innovation and ultimately the quality, reliability and value of the performance and experience we deliver to consumers every day. Now I'll turn it back to Jon to provide details of our outlook for this fiscal year. Jon R. Moeller - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, A.G. First, a few more housekeeping items. The guidance we're providing this morning assumes the transitioning beauty businesses are accounted for as discontinued operations, and are not therefore included in core EPS for either 2015 or 2016 fiscal years. This is the same approach we've taken with Duracell. While the amounts are not yet final, we expect fiscal 2015 core earnings per share to be restated from the $4.02 level to approximately $3.77 per share. The informational 8-K we plan to issue in September will provide more detail, including fiscal 2015 quarterly income statements and segment results. Towards the end of the calendar year we'll provide a fully restated 10-K for 2015. While we'll no longer include the results from our Venezuelan operations in our consolidated results, the fiscal 2015 results will remain in our base period sales and earnings. This will create a minor drag on organic sales growth trends and a $0.05 to $0.06 per share headwind on core earnings per share growth. Next, some context for fiscal 2016. We have large positions, leading positions in several big markets where underlying growth has slowed, most notably China and Brazil. Foreign exchange will continue to be a significant sales and earnings headwind, particularly in the first two quarters. To offset the foreign exchange impacts and restore structural economics, we've taken significant price increases in some markets. We need to manage through the market contraction and volatility that naturally follow. We have disproportionately large positions in the markets most affected by FX. We're market leaders in Russia, the Ukraine, in Japan and in Venezuela. In contrast, many of our internationally domiciled competitors are benefiting from their weaker currencies, providing fuel for reinvestment. We need to be cognizant of this as we construct our own plans and as we contemplate guidance. We're not yet able to focus 100% on driving the 10 core categories we've been talking about. While the portfolio planning work is complete, we still own and are operating the transitioning brands including Duracell and the beauty brands. Some smart choices will also create top line pressure. We've mentioned previously, we're simplifying and strengthening the product form and SKU lineups for our core categories. As we de-prioritize our exit product forms, for example the more commodity section of the laundry business, laundry bars as an example, there has been and will be some pressure on organic sales growth. On the bottom line, I've mentioned FX. There will also be a drag in non-operating income as we annualize the small brand divestiture gains, and we will see a higher core tax rate. We'll continue to invest in increased sales coverage and in fast-growing retail channels and formats. We will increase our innovation, our investment in innovation pipeline, and in the examples of recent innovations like Always Discreet, Fusion FlexBall, Venus Swirl and the new diaper innovations that A.G. mentions that are coming to market now and in the next six months. We'll continue to invest in the supply chain, adding new capacity closer to consumers as our business grows and optimizing the supply chain in developed markets. Against this volatile backdrop, we think it's prudent to start fiscal 2016 from a guidance standpoint with relatively modest, relatively wide target ranges. We're projecting organic sales growth in line to up low single digits versus fiscal 2015. We've recently delivered towards the low end of this range. We certainly aim to improve, but it's unlikely that growth acceleration will happen immediately or in a straight line. And as I mentioned, there are market and competitive dynamics as well as internal choices that will continue to put some pressure on the top line. The headwind from foreign exchange will have a 4% to 5 percentage point impact on all-in sales growth. Also, minor brand divestitures will have a modest drag on all-in sales growth. Taken together, we expect all-in sales growth to be down low to mid single digits versus restated fiscal 2015 results. We expect to deliver solid operating margin expansion driven by another year of strong productivity-driven savings in cost of goods sold, overhead and non-working marketing and agency costs. Cost of goods sold productivity savings are forecast to be consistent with our annual run rate projection of about $1.2 billion. Commodities will also provide a modest benefit. These growth margin enhancers will be partially offset by foreign exchange. Based on last week's rates, FX will be a $350 million to $450 million after-tax headwind on fiscal 2016 earnings, or a 3 to 4 percentage point drag. This impact has two primary components. The spot rate impact of fiscal 2016 is expected to be a 7 to 8 percentage point headwind on core earnings per share growth. The spot rate impact should be partially offset by about 4 points of balance sheet revaluation hurt in fiscal 2015, but if current rates hold, will not recur in fiscal 2016. SG&A costs will also be a contributor to operated profit growth driven by continued overhead and marketing productivity savings and lower year-on-year charges for balance sheet revaluation. With this strong operating margin expansion, we expect to deliver core operating income growth of mid to high single digits. This includes the $0.05 to $0.06 per share drag on operating earnings from the Venezuela accounting change, and $0.02 to $0.03 per share of beauty deal transition costs that will remain in our core earnings results. So strong underlying operating earnings progress, which excluding the $0.08 impact from these items, should be up high singles to low double digits. Moving below the operating line, there are several items you should take into account as you construct your models. We're forecasting non-operating income to be a 2 to 3 percentage point drag on core EPS growth. We had a large number of minor brand divestitures last year, and the scope and pace of these deals will decrease this year. We're estimating a core effective tax rate of about 24% for fiscal 2016, about 3 points higher than the fiscal 2015 rate, due mainly to lower benefits from audit resolutions. Combined non-operating income and tax will be a $0.23 to $0.26 per share core earnings per share headwind in fiscal 2016, a 6% to 7% impact on core EPS growth. Finally, we'll retire shares at a value of approximately $8 billion to $9 billion through a combination of direct share repurchase and shares that will be exchanged in the Duracell transaction. We're now expecting the Duracell transaction to close in the first quarter of calendar 2016. This is a little later than our original projections as both parties continue to prioritize flawless execution over speed. We're starting fiscal 2016 with core earnings per share growth guidance of slightly below to up mid single digits versus last fiscal year's restated earnings per share of $3.77, again a wide and relatively modest range. All-in GAAP earnings per share should be up 53% to 63% versus the prior fiscal year GAAP earnings per share of $2.44. Non-core items in the current year will include non-core restructuring charges of approximately $0.15 per share and net earnings from discontinued operations of about $0.17 per share, which includes the after-tax profit from operations and transaction exit costs of the beauty and battery businesses. This compares to total non-core costs of approximately $1.33 per share in fiscal 2015. We expect another strong year of free cash flow productivity, 90% to 100%. Drivers of this strong cash productivity will include continued improvement of payables, including continued progress on our supply chain financing program and continued steady improvement in inventory levels. These improvements should offset an increase in capital spending as we invest in the supply chain transformation A.G. and I discussed earlier. We expect CapEx to be between 5% and 6% of sales for the fiscal year. We'll continue to build on our strong track record of cash and overall value return to shareholders. In addition to the $8 billion to $9 billion of shares we expect to retire, we expect dividend payments of more than $7 billion. In total, $15 billion to $16 billion in dividend payments, share exchanges and share repurchase. To briefly recap the key assumptions underpinning our fiscal 2016 outlook, this guidance assumes mid July foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. Further significant currency weakness is not anticipated within our guidance. Like 2015 then, we're setting up fiscal 2016 as a year, given all of the market and FX volatility and pricing, of modest top line growth, solid core operating income growth, relatively robust constant currency core earnings per share growth and strong 90% to 100% free cash flow productivity. We'll continue to tighten and implement our strategy on the core business, investing where appropriate to build capabilities for long-term success. We'll continue to drive meaningful productivity opportunities. We'll invest in sales coverage, innovation and the supply chain and we'll substantially complete the execution of our portfolio redesign. That concludes our prepared remarks for this morning. As a reminder, business segment information is provided in our press release and will be available in slides which will be posted on our website www.pg.com following the call. Now A.G. and I would be happy to take questions. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of John Faucher. John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks. Good morning. So you guys have delivered a lot on the structural stuff, sort of brand disposals, et cetera, and you're delivering on the productivity as evidenced by the gross margin performance. But unlike many of the other companies we all cover, the underlying business appears to be getting worse and maybe at an accelerating rate. So I think this could argue for two things. One, that the organization can't handle this much change at one time and you need to slow down. Or conversely, there needs to be a lot more and bigger change, structural leadership, et cetera. So you guys are obviously going with option three right now, which is to sort of stay the course with the initial plan. But why should we all feel comfortable that that's the right course given the results and a little bit to some extent the guidance? Thanks. Jon R. Moeller - Chief Financial Officer : Well I'd say, John, that we're in the middle of executing that plan, course three as you've outlined, and are to a place where we have the full benefit of for instance being able to focus on the 10 product categories which we will as we get through the beauty transition. We're also in the middle of dealing with some very significant market level events, which are kind of outside the strategy completely. But we're the market leader in a lot of the countries that are difficult right now, Russia's an example, and as I mentioned, we've made a very deliberate choice. The choice we had in Russia was very simple. We could accept negative gross margins in perpetuity, or we could price to restore structural economics so that future growth would be worth something. And that's the choice we've taken there as in other markets. And it's had a significant impact as we expected. So if you look at the month of June for example, our sales in Russia were down 57%, and we've got to work our way through these things. But we're taking an approach that we're convinced is the right approach for the long term. As A.G. mentioned as well, the innovation pipeline which we've been investing to accelerate, that acceleration is going to start hitting the marketplace as we go through the next year, which will help as well. And then ultimately at some point, we get to a place where FX isn't as much of an issue on either the top or bottom line, and we continue to deliver productivity savings which allow us to reinvest behind this innovation and grow faster. We clearly recognize the need to grow faster. We think we're making the choices that will allow that to happen in a sustainable way over the long term. We're not going to get there in the next quarter or two. But we do expect sequential progress as we move through next fiscal year. Alan G. Lafley - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : John, I'd just add two quick ones. On your first direct question, I actually think the employees, management and leadership has really stepped up. I won't bore you with all the details of what it takes to operate in Russia, Ukraine, Argentina, Venezuela, even Japan, okay, and a whole host of other developing markets. But in virtually every case, we are making the right decisions and frankly building our value creation. We've switched countries like India from a significant negative profit position to making basically $100 million, okay, in two years, all right. Our Brazil economics are the best they've ever been, still not where we want them to be, but the best we've ever been. So I think the organization has won the operational play and executed pretty consistently and pretty well. We've at the same time dramatically stepped up the productivity program. And it isn't separate. It's integrated. That's the part that everybody misses, it's totally integrated productivity program. And that will run easily through the end of the decade. Third, we have dramatically invested in R&D sales. All the things we need to get back on our strategy and our game. And then the second thing I would say is, and this is hard for you to see, but I'll pick a couple of examples. Take baby, okay. Round numbers about half the value creation in the world is in the US and North America. Three years ago the category wasn't growing, okay. In two to three years we've put ourselves in a position where we are growing share and leading in share growth, okay. And we haven't even brought all of our premium taped line or our pants to market and as I said, they're coming in the next couple of years. Take fabric, well, let me stick with baby. In Europe we continued to do well on a value creation standpoint. The game has changed. It's us and private label. We're adjusting to that game. In China we've been very straight up, okay. We still have the leading brand. We're stuck in the middle of the market. We went down, the consumer went up. Both the pants and premium taped lines are shipping as we speak. I could go through category by category, but fabrics the same story. We generated $1.4 billion in PODS. We are actively adding PODS capacity and expanding around the world, $330 million in beads. We've stimulated fabric conditioner growth 7%. But on the bottom end, as Jon described, we've been getting out of cheap commodity-like bagged powders. We've been getting out of laundry bars. We've been getting out of unprofitable additives. We've gotten out of bleach. So that's what you have to look at. And I guess the third point I would make is, the last thing I want to do is chase volume and share that has no value, or very little value. I do not want to get ahead of ourselves, and slam on the accelerator and try to grow faster on the volume or share side. We've been to that movie before, okay. So we're picking our spots. We're doing first things first. We're doing it with product that consumers really prefer. And here's the other thing that's really important. Most of the moves we're making are stimulating category and market growth, and then it becomes a win for your customer, your supplier and your partner, not just for the consumer and the company. I happen to believe the obsessive focus on value creation is incredibly important and we'll get the growth when and where we can, and frankly when and where consumers choose our brands and products. And we believe it's coming. We all wish it would come faster, but it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to try to do it faster. Your last question I guess implied was should we do something more dramatic. We think the portfolio that we're moving into actually has the potential to create a lot of value. And most of those businesses we've created significant value in the past, or are beginning to create significant value again. And we wouldn't be playing there unless we thought we could do it. We've looked at all the alternatives many times, okay, and this is the best alternative for us. It's the best alternative for share owners because it creates the most potential value. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong, Bank of America. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning, thanks. As you look back at this year and the sales shortfall, can you talk through some of the key drivers? I mean was it more a lack of innovation or just innovation that missed their target? Or were the products not priced properly or was competition just better? And then what are your categories growing at now? And how do you think about market share growth for next year? And then just secondly, maybe can we talk through price mix in developed markets and where you think that will go next year? Particularly as we think about your longer term thoughts on pricing in North America with, if we look at baby and family care, you know Kimberly has been pushing price in tissue and diaper. So maybe if you could just address those two things. Thanks a bunch. Alan G. Lafley - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Where to start. I'll take a shot at the last one. Yes, competition has been pushing pricing in the two examples that you mentioned. We continue to grow our share and our value creation in baby in the US. And as I hope I pointed out clearly enough in tissue/towel, we've just very smartly picked our spots, and we're very comfortable with holding sales as long as we create more value. We still have leading brand positions in the principal categories. And the fact of the matter is we're getting more than our fair share of value creation there, and that's the way we want to keep it. Look, on the first part of your question, Olivia, it's really none of the above, okay. It's really none of the above. And I'll just mention two examples because they're significant because the competitor thing is often mentioned. We had major competitive moves in big stronghold markets for us in fabric care in the last year, okay. One competitor moved into the Arabian Peninsula where we've had a long and strong position with consumers. The other as you know moved into the US at the largest retailer. In both cases our share is at or above the level that it was before the encroachment, okay, before their introduction. And in both cases we continued to create strong value. It's more an issue of timing of the moves that we'll be making category by category and the roll-off of the non-performing or under-performing parts of the business. Jon R. Moeller - Chief Financial Officer : And I would say our guidance was low to mid singles. We delivered low singles. And the difference between the high and the low end of the range I think can largely be attributed to the macro dynamic in FX which you can sometimes characterize as impacting everybody. That wasn't the case this year as many of our competitors benefited significantly from FX. While we, it was a huge headwind for ourselves. And so that is a differentiator between firms in our industry and that is part of the reason that we're at the lower end of the range. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers, UBS. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning, guys, thanks. So A.G., it feels like with the Coty transaction and David's announcement this week as CEO, you really declared the recent phase of reshaping is in some ways done, and now it's time to move forward. But I guess my question is, building on your prepared remarks, what are you going to do differently as you move forward? Because while much of what you've outlined sounds reasonable and logical and makes sense, but also seems to John's Faucher's point like a continuation of what you've been doing and saying the last few years, and we haven't seen that return at least as measured on the top line. So what I'm looking for is less about what you're going to continue doing and more about where and how you and David are going to invest differently in the coming years. And I don't want to make this just about beauty, but as an example, what deficiencies are you trying to overcome when it comes to a brand like Olay and what is that going to cost? Alan G. Lafley - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. You know, unfortunately this isn't a continuation of what we were doing and I don't want to belabor that. But we were clearly over-expanded, okay, into developing markets and even into frontier developing markets, and you know what's happened there in terms of growth slowdown, economic and political volatility and the FX issue which Jon has mentioned a couple of times is real, and will continue through the end of this calendar year, okay. But it is a change. And the second thing is, we were clearly over-extended in several categories. The most obvious one was beauty where we got into service businesses and more fashion and trend oriented businesses. That didn't turn out to be a good fit for us. So I would argue we've changed quite a bit in the last two years. And the big change has been a dramatic narrowing of the focus and choices. And the other big change has been getting back to balanced innovation and productivity that really drives value creation. We were not on a value creation building strategy. We were on a short-term volume and share building strategy. That doesn't work unless you're creating value. The other thing I would say is, like it or not, and I don't like it very much either, it takes time to change direction. Our plans as I've said before are sold out six to 12 months with our customers. As you might imagine, when you've got plant and equipment and major investment involved, it takes time to set up behind major initiatives. So all of that has had to be done. And much of it is underway. And the last two points I'll make is it's more than words that we do well when we focus on following the shopper and consumer, not the competitor, shopper and the consumer. We do well when we grow categories and markets, okay. PODS and beads and concentrated HDLs grow the fabric care market. FlexBall and Swirl grow the shave care and grooming market. Shave care and grooming market was in the doldrums, not growing very fast. It's actually grown the last six months the fastest it's grown in several years, and I could go on there. But those are the differences. And I'm not a big fan of change for change sake. I'm a big fan of running plays that work. And I think one of the big questions behind the question is, how fast can we do this? And my view, very strong view, is I'm much more interested in getting it right, okay, and making changes that really sustain value creation, and making changes that lead to sustainable and reliable growth. And that's the path we're on. And by the way in the meantime, the reason we focus so hard on operating cash flow and free cash flow, so hard on our operating margins is so we could continue to return dividends and share repurchase to share owners while we are getting this company positioned to grow on a more sustainable basis. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman, Barclays. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. A couple times you've mentioned significant reinvestments in sales force. So I was hoping you could talk a little bit about what's been done so far, what needed addressing. Is it particular channels, is it particular geographies? And then also how that fits into a kind of a chicken and egg conversation about having innovation in market and things you really want to get behind versus what sounds like maybe with the exception clearly of things like FlexBall and PODS, but some kind of like biding time new product work with the real exciting stuff to come in the next year plus. Thanks. Alan G. Lafley - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Lauren, I guess the answer is sort of yes to your series of questions. Let me try to describe it as clearly and crisply as I can. When you choose to follow the shopper, you obviously have to commit coverage and resources to growing channels, and we've done that. So we're in a much better position for example in e-commerce than we were three years ago. E-commerce is growing 30% to 40%. We're pretty competitive. There's still upside opportunities and there's more to come with subscription and auto-replenishment, okay. So yes. Follow the shopper into the channels that are growing. E-commerce is one. Drug is obviously another one. Small box discounters. I could go on. That varies by region, by country and we've made and are making that shift. The second one is dedicated to category and to retail account sales support. And I think we've talked before that we've added a significant number of dedicated sales resources. We started in the US where we're doing it category to customer. We're doing it in China where it's essentially category to channel or customer. And as we continue to gain experience and as we continue to see the results, we are prepared to make those investments, okay. And that leads to a third and incredibly important point. This is a highly executional category. And a big part of how we do day in and day out is whether our distribution's right and whether our shelf's right. And we didn't talk much about this today. We touched on it in the Olay context, so I'll return to Olay, but we've now run a series of tests in countries, more than one country around the world, several countries around the world. And we're rolling out in the US first and then in China a dramatically simplified category-based and Olay-based shelf set. And without going into all the details, it fairly significantly reduces the SKUs. It focuses on the products and boutiques that consumers want. And in every case so far, knock on wood okay, we have lifted category sales with our retail partner, which they want and Olay has benefited by lifting its sales rate and share. So we'll see. But that kind of stuff is like incredibly important. And yeah, it's blocking and tackling but we got to get back to the blocking and tackling that works. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank. William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: First of all, congratulations, A.G., on the retirement the second time around. But my real question, were you guys tempted at all to more dramatically rebase earnings? Because it sounds like some of the investments are being deferred for because of some of the macro environment. But it's kind of hard to manage a business based on currency, because it's out of your control. So I was wondering if you had more resources in the P&L, could you do both, sort of like drive the productivity and the cash flow and also reinvest and stop the share declines? Because it seems like on my math the categories globally grew 3% and you guys were flat. So that's quite a bit of share loss I guess this quarter. So I'd just love to hear your thoughts on that topic. Thanks. Jon R. Moeller - Chief Financial Officer : A couple things there, Bill. One is we did not, in the year that we just completed, curtail investment to offset FX, and you'll recall actually that when the more significant FX impacts occurred, we took our guidance down specifically to protect the investments that we needed to make in the future. I think our guidance ranges that we've provided for next year, well in fact I know, they accommodate fully the investments that we're planning to make going forward. So, and I think there's further opportunity to drive productivity, which will provide another opportunity to reinvest, I mean productivity beyond even what's in our current plan. So I do not see these as contradictory in any way. Alan G. Lafley - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Bill, we did not pass on a single growth and value creating investment that was brought to us. You just have to look at our CapEx. We're putting hundreds of millions, billions, into new plants. We're putting up a new concentrated HDL plant in China that opens this summer. We're putting up a new plant in Brazil. We're putting up a new plant in Sub-Sahara Africa. We've been racing to add PODS capacity. We're racing to put new Infinity and Radiance capacity in because of demand for our femcare lines. Across baby diapers, hundreds of millions to convert to pants and premium taped as fast as we can. Again, I'm not going to go into the details, but in our plans in the year going forward, we have 10%, 20% and more increases in media budgets. It's hard for you to see our investments in communication and media because most of it's being funded by reallocation. We're simply shutting down the unproductive non-working dollars and we're converting it to working, and we're getting a heck of a lot more out of our digital mobile search and social programs depending on market, depending on category, depending on brand. But we've invested in sales. Every year we invest in R&D. And the good news is, knock on wood, for the most part, and R&D's a risky business, product innovation's always a risky business, but so far the teams have been delivering very high rates of products that are delivering high levels of consumer satisfaction, and as I said earlier, with a fair amount of uniqueness and differentiation. The issue is it takes some time to get them to commercialization and then get them expanding. But we haven't slowed anything down. If anything, we've accelerated a bunch of these programs by three, six, and some by as much as 12 to 18 months. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian, Morgan Stanley. Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning. So first just a detail question. Jon, given David's start date is not until November as CEO, is this fiscal 2016 earnings guidance blessed by him, or might he choose to take a different view around the level of reinvestment needed behind the business and therefore earnings guidance? And the real question is, sorry to kind of belabor John's question earlier, but while it was helpful to hear that you're making more progress perhaps than is evident in the results, it's been a few years now of disappointing results. So I'd love to hear what's kind of plan B if you don't see the improvement in the business you expect going forward as you look out to fiscal 2017 and the historical changes aren't enough to get you to the TSR levels you desire. Maybe you can discuss some of the options at your disposal, whether it's the earnings rebates that Bill mentioned, to reinvest back behind the business, a split up, et cetera, but why those options don't make sense and how confident you are that the historical changes will actually drive improved results going forward. Thanks. Jon R. Moeller - Chief Financial Officer : Well first of all, the strategy that underlies the guidance, the strategy and the plan are a company strategy and plan. That's all the way through the board. It's their strategy and plan. It's through the senior management team, which David has been an integral member of. And it's part of what the organization, every person in the organization's work plan is based off. So it's not an individual strategy or plan. It's a company strategy or plan. Having said that, I expect David will do what he's always done, and we'll do what we always do, which is wake up every morning and put our bare feet on the cold hard floor and optimize what's in front of us. And we live in a volatile world and we need to be responding to that on a daily basis. So we're not going to get locked or trapped in a very narrow element of our plan. We'll modify that as we need to. And I'm sure David will approach it that way. Alan G. Lafley - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And I think, Dara, to the second half of your question, it's again a very simple answer. We'll change. Yeah, if it's not working, we'll change. Portfolio, we think it's 90/10, 95/5. They're never done, okay? They're never done. We will make acquisitions in the year or two ahead. We will probably have another divestiture or two in the year ahead. But we'll change. If the baby program doesn't work, we'll modify the baby program. If the fabric care program doesn't work, we'll modify the fabric care program. If we can't compete in a business after 20 years, after 5 years, after 10 years, we'll get out of the business. So I mean I think that's very straightforward. Jon R. Moeller - Chief Financial Officer : And I think the last year is full testament to that. I mean you're right, the results aren't, haven't \u2013 we're not there yet. But moving out 60% of the brands in one year, that's not an indication of a company that's unwilling to embrace necessary change. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo. Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hey thanks, guys. I guess just a couple of housekeeping, and then a real one. So first Mexico and Japan, right, both of those, like Japan because of the consumption tax timing and Mexico because of the backing out of promos. Can you talk about how those have progressed and how they might have affected the top line? On the tax rate going back up to 24% for next year, should we view that as the beginning of a more normalized tax rate for you guys? I guess, how are you thinking about it longer term? And then just lastly on the Coty deal, on the timing mismatch between the lost earnings from moving the business to disc ops and the share retirement, I guess because there's a year in between, right. As your shareholders, like how should we think about this deal truly being not dilutive, right, your ability to offset that. In other words, for that really to be true fiscal 2017, you can understand this is a long way out, fiscal 2017 needs to be a way above algorithm year because the share count is going to be so low. So, I know you're not going to guide out there, but just conceptually, would that be the plan? Is that what people should think about, that the share count moves that much lower, therefore 2017 will be a big bounce back year from an earnings standpoint all else equal? Thanks guys. Jon R. Moeller - Chief Financial Officer : I'm going to take those in reverse order Chris. On the Coty transaction and the impacts, there's obviously some accounting changes that move things between continued operations and discontinued operations, but until the day that deal closes, all of the cash that those businesses generates goes into our bank account. So in terms of real economic impact next year is, all the cash is ours. And then in the following year, which is what we committed to when we had the call a couple weeks ago, we said post close there would be no dilution going forward, and that's still our plan. So that's kind of Coty. The tax rate at 24%, I think certainly the rate that we've been at is lower than we're going to have going forward just because we've been, as we've been successfully concluding RS(76:51) releasing reserves, and those are down to pretty low balances. So the 20%, I would call it 23% to 25% as being a normalized rate going forward. On Mexico and Japan, we saw a sequential improvement in Mexico, and are really getting to a point where that will be behind us. But in the quarter that had a 20 basis point impact in terms of top line growth. And then Japan obviously went the other way, and was a help to the quarter versus the year-ago softness. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research. Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Hi, good morning, everyone. I guess I mean we all kind of like gyrating again around the same point which is, what it seems to be a lack of balance between top line growth and delivering very strong EPS growth, however theoretical because it's all currency neutral growth. So I wonder whether you have explained to us what you are doing with pruning the portfolio and how that impact top line growth. Because you had mentioned here things that are not divested, that you have been shutting down and cutting. That may be optically worsening the fundamental of the business. Thank you. Jon R. Moeller - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, so a couple things here. One and I think it's important to understand the order and the sequence in what we're trying to turn this ship around. And growing before we have the right structural economics, it doesn't create any value. So we're trying very hard through the productivity program, through the work we're doing in FX-impacted markets to ensure that we have the right basis to grow from. That doesn't mean we're not seizing opportunities that exist, but we're being choiceful and we're sequencing. And then when that growth comes, it's going to be worth something. The, I guess I just, you know. Alan G. Lafley - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah and I guess on the second half of your question, Javier, the answer is yes. We tried to give you two or three examples. The family care or tissue/towel example, we were quite okay with a 100 index on net sales because we made in our view a smart decision to get out of over time, which is as fast as we can, unprofitable conventional paper businesses in Mexico and to replace that with lower sales but much more structurally attractive exports of our best products from the US into Mexico, which will be purchased by certain consumers and by certain customers and we talked about being choiceful about which initiatives we took in which sequence. And we're just not going to move until we think we have a very good chance of winning with consumers and shoppers and until we have the economics right, okay. We mentioned the laundry example because that is a big one. And while we've been charging forward on PODS, concentrated heavy duty liquids, machine wash powders, all trade up, all preferred products by consumers, all growing in most developing markets, not just developed markets. We have been pruning Tier 4 and some Tier 3 bagged commodity-like powders. We've been pruning laundry bars, as Jon said. We have gotten out of commodity bleach. We have dramatically pruned our additives portfolio and just kept the ones that we thought were strategic and profitable. So yes, that is going on. And the point we were trying to make is while Jon and I and many others have been working on the company portfolio, the business unit leadership has been working on their portfolio. Some of it has been sold off. Hair care was an example, okay. Some of it has been shut down or otherwise resolved. And that just keeps getting better. Jon R. Moeller - Chief Financial Officer : And I just want to make sure, one last point on this, I want to make sure we're being understood. We know the top line has to grow. Alan G. Lafley - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : (81:32) Jon R. Moeller - Chief Financial Officer : I've shown you charts before. We'll probably show another one at Barclays, which is the exact chart that we talk to our organization about internally, which shows that we cannot get to our OTSR objectives with only bottom line growth. We cannot get to our OTSR objectives equally without only top line growth. That's the beauty of the metric. It's a balancing metric. And so we get it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj from Bernstein. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. So you sound very different than I would have hoped on the call today or on CNBC this morning. There's still a lot of defiance. There's still a lot of confidence, it feels like. And look, all the frustration we're all feeling, I feel as well probably times 10. You're kind of brushing off the tough questions and maintaining this trust us, it'll turn, it'll turn. But just let me offer you a look through the lens of a shareholder, right, who you are as well. And you see what the stock price has done, and you look at organic sales growth and it's dismal and it's getting worse, and you admit that. And the cost savings are good but they seem too small and they seem like they're slowing in some cases, like the net part of it is slowing. The transaction is complex and tough and I get it, but maybe it's not as big as it should be, and you have a CEO with respect to, at least versus a lot of people's expectations of leaving a little early. You missed four or five years in a row, and it just feels like there's still this trust us and things will change because we're divesting things. But I still struggle to see what's actually going be different. I get you're going to get rid of 14% of your sales, 15% of your sales and 6% of your operating profit. But is that really it? Is that 1% incremental growth you're going to get out of getting out of those businesses, is that what we're hoping for as shareholders? And I guess how long do you want to wait? How long do you want us to wait before you do think about bigger changes? I understand that you don't want to go there now, but how long do we have to wait? And particularly on this kind of new normal of more active shareholder, I struggle with what keeps us at bay or what keeps us pleased. Alan G. Lafley - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Do you have a recommendation, Ali? Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Well I think plan B, which is seriously think about breaking up the company. That's very complex, is a viable option. It sounds like you guys have looked at it and I don't understand why it hasn't worked. Because the stuff you're doing seems to make sense. All right, the stuff you're doing that we listed, cost cutting and trying to innovate more and closing price gaps where you have to and raising accountability, all these things from a classic strategic consulting thoughtful way make sense, but it's just not working. So we all are frustrated but we also feel for you because the strategy is possibly the right one. Which might suggest there's another, bigger solution here, right? Which is it's just too big to run. Alan G. Lafley - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Maybe perhaps you're not even a growth company anymore and you have to think about it differently from just being growth. I mean there are other options that we don't hear being contemplated or argued against. It's just a trust us. And I think that's at least my frustration. Alan G. Lafley - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Let me just say a couple of things because we may see things differently, although I want to make sure that you understand and everyone understands that we consider every option and run every analysis. First point, the company is 40% to 50% less complex and I don't think that's understood. It's just dawning on us that that's incredibly important, okay. The second thing is the time horizon, okay. Our time horizon is more consistent, more reliable, more sustainable growth and value creation and we believe that you build a foundation and you build this sort of a building block at a time. And I would argue that you just have to look at what we've been able to do with half of our program in place in North America in baby diapers, and you could, without a great leap of faith, consider that we might be able to do the same again in China where we still have the leading brand, when we bring a consumer-preferred pull-on or pant and when we bring the next generation of premium taped diapers in a market where new moms are flocking to imported Japanese premium products that we know how to compete with. The same thing in fabric care. You could conclude that we have gotten a stubborn category that wasn't growing in the US growing again. We have been able to trade new consumers into a mature category, trade them up, grow with retailers and the supply chain. You can see what we've done in Japan, okay, where we've grown significantly. And you could say yeah, it really does take 18 months to put up a brand new manufacturing plant, and we are shipping, okay, in China. And I could just go around the world. Hair care, we have totally redone the product and technology program and we've positioned ourselves to start shipping the first product. So I mean I understand the point. Just two more comments on the breakup and then impossible to manage. We reverse engineered and analyzed in detail the last decade exit from the food and beverage business. We did it internally and we did it with outside objective view. And we concluded that we generated significantly more value for shareowners in our focused and deliberate step at a time withdrawal from segments of that industry. And it was about the same size exit as the one we're going through now. I can't remember the precise number, Jon, but it was probably $6 billion or $7 billion. So we're all about optimizing value for shareowners, but it's over a longer time horizon I think than you are. And then I think the last question will always be a question, and that is can the leadership and management team manage and deliver. And we think we can. It's a new team. David and I are going to be side by side for the next several months, year or more. And we think we're to the point where a lot of this is operationalization, which is incredibly important, and just good execution, consistent and excellent every day. So I understand the point about patience and impatience. I think as Jon said earlier we're in violent agreement. We want to grow the top line as much as anybody on the call. And we just think that one step at a time, it's coming. And oh, by the way, we've got two, we got another several months of tough sweating ahead because the environment in developing markets and this whole FX thing isn't going to change. We're just trying to be realists here. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello with Raymond James. Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Just one quick one in terms of the transition. Obviously when you guys come out of this, you're going to look a lot different. You mentioned, A.G., you're going to be 40% to 50% less complex, in theory, at least on paper, a faster growing, more profitable company. But can you talk about the capital intensity of Procter & Gamble two or three years from now? Are you going to be a lot less capital intense given the new business, or the new portfolio that you'll have at that point? Thanks. Alan G. Lafley - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No. No, we won't, okay. I'd said, Joe, we're in a period where we're clearly investing, okay, and returning but replatforming of our Grooming business, which has enabled us to introduce the Venus upgrade in like six months after the male upgrade, the investments we're making in the new product innovation in fabric, the major investments we're making in new product in baby. And as Jon said, putting up the six new mixing and distribution centers in North America. And we're rolling, we'll be rolling across Europe over the next several years, finish the job in North America over the next several years and we'll move on to developing markets with getting our supply chain as effective and efficient as streamlined as possible. So I don't think you're going to see an increase. We would hope for it to level out in time, but I would say for the next one, two, three years, we're going to be investing at about the current rate in CapEx. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

Operator : Good morning and welcome to Procter & Gamble's quarter end conference call. P&G would like to remind you that today's discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections. Also, as required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with valuable information on the underlying growth trends of the business and has posted on its website, www.PG.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP and other financial measures. Now I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller. Jon R. Moeller - Chief Financial Officer : Good morning. The quarter we just completed was a strong one from both a cash flow and underlying earnings perspective. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was very strong at 101%. Constant currency core earnings per share increased double digits, with meaningful triple-digit basis point improvements in both gross and operating margins on both a constant currency and all-in basis. All-in GAAP earnings per share were up 32%. Organic sales were down a point, reflecting deliberate choices to exit some structurally unprofitable business lines, volatile market conditions, and the early stage we are at in our strengthening and improvement plans on large categories and markets. We're bringing innovations to market and are making investments in value equations, sampling and in trial of our products and brands, as well as in selling coverage. We expect organic top line growth to resume in Q2, with further strengthening in the back half. We do continue to operate in a challenging and volatile macro environment. Market growth rates on both a volume and value basis are decelerating, due mainly to slower growth in developing markets. We entered the year expecting the market to grow close to 4% globally. We now expect 3%. There are more flashpoints across the globe than at any time in recent memory. Currencies are weakening pretty much across the board, a $300 million after-tax impact since the start of the fiscal year and $600 million after-tax versus year ago. This, as you know, comes on top of a $1.5 billion impact last fiscal year and a $1.1 billion impact the year before. P&G has leading positions in some of the toughest markets. Versus the next multinational competitor, our business is over three times larger in Russia and the Ukraine. In Japan, where devaluations had a significant impact, the business is six times larger than the next largest non-Japanese competitor. We're almost three times larger in China, where the market has recently slowed. In the Middle East, which has been heavily impacted by political instability, war, crashing oil prices, our business is two times larger than the next multinational competitor. These tough markets represent over $14 billion in sales or roughly 20% of the company, so they're not trivial. The relative strength of the dollar has made it tougher for us than our euro and yen functional currency competitors. We're facing, for example, a 40% devaluation in Russia, while our euro functional competitors are facing half of that. Each of these items are realities, not excuses, and many of these dynamics will continue. Against this backdrop, we're staying focused on big opportunities in our control, executing what is the largest transformation in our company's history, step-changing productivity, transforming our supply chain, focusing our portfolio, and strengthening category business model and innovation plans. This transformation strategy is ultimately a growth strategy. We're dramatically improving productivity, with a lot of upside still ahead. In February 2012, we announced that we would reduce non-manufacturing overhead by 10% over five years. As of September 30, we've reduced these roles by 23%, more than double the original target, and are on track to meet a revised target of 25% to 30% by the end of fiscal 2017. Our original cost of goods savings target was $6 billion. We expect to deliver over $7 billion by the end of this year, 15% above our initial target. We've reduced manufacturing enrollment by 15% over the last three years. This includes new staffing necessary to support capacity additions. On a same-site basis, manufacturing enrollment is down nearly 20%. As with overhead, we're targeting a 25% to 30% cumulative reduction by the end of fiscal 2017. We are strengthening marketing, greater reach, higher frequency, greater effectiveness, at less overall cost. Last year we reduced the number of agencies we work with by nearly 40% and cut agency and production spending by $300 million. We're aiming for an additional $200 million of agency-related savings this year. These are non-working savings that enable us to invest in working media and sampling dollars. We're also driving balance sheet productivity. Inventory days are down year on year. Payables days are up. The moves we made here have enabled us to extend our long track record of strong adjusted free cash flow productivity, 102% last fiscal year, 101% last quarter, despite the investments we're making in our supply chain. We continue to maintain our position as one of the strongest cash generators among competitive peers and comparable mega-cap companies. We're also among the top companies in returning cash to shareholders. In fiscal 2015 we increased our dividend for the 59th consecutive year and returned $11.9 billion in cash to shareholders, 105% of adjusted net earnings. Over the past five years we've returned $60 billion to shareholders and intend to pay dividends, retire shares, and repurchase shares worth up to $70 billion over just the next four years. We're transforming our supply chain to lower cost, reduce inventory, improve customer service levels, and increase product quality and process reliability. We're re-siting manufacturing capacity closer to major consumer populations and our new distribution hubs. We're shutting down older, more remote single-category production sites and building new multi-category facilities. We continue to localize manufacturing and sourcing, reducing costs and currency exposure. We're upgrading, automating, and standardizing our operations, improving manufacturing process reliability and asset utilization rates. As you know, we are transforming our portfolio. We're centered 10 category-based business units where P&G has leading market positions, strong brands, and consumer-meaningful product technologies. These 10 categories have been growing faster with higher margins than the balance of the company. These are categories with clear consumer jobs to be done, where product functionality and efficacy matters. They are products that consumers purchase in our channels and use on a daily basis. We will be a company of superior brands and products in these 10 product categories. Within these core businesses, we're also focusing our portfolios to maximize value creation. We're making smart choices for short, mid, and long-term value creation or going-bad business, even when these choices create short-term top line pressure. In the Mexico tissue business, for example, we're shifting our focus from low-tier conventional tissue products to premium-tier differentiated products. This will reduce sales by nearly $75 million, over 1% of global category sales, but profit will increase by more than $30 million. We've made similar choices in Fabric Care. We are deprioritizing less profitable non-strategic brands and product lines and low-price offerings to improve the profitability of the business at a trade-off of about a point of sales growth in the category. We've also accepted trade-off of top line for value creation at the market level. In India, for example, we've accepted a reduction in top line growth from mid-teens to high singles, improving local profit margins more than 700 basis points last year. We'll continue to grow, but now the growth will be worth something. We've been strengthening business unit strategies, business models, and product innovation, but in particular priority against the four largest categories, Baby Care, Fabric Care, Hair Care and Grooming, and the two largest markets, the U.S. and China. We're focusing our Laundry business on consumer preferred brands and product innovations like our premium performance and premium priced unit-dosed detergents, our market-leading and market-expanding scent bead fabric enhancers. And we're launching better performing and more profitable new compact liquid detergents in Russia, Turkey, Mexico, Brazil, and China. The Fabric Care results in the U.S. demonstrate what is possible when we get the strategy balanced and the innovation program focused on what matters most to consumers, superior value and best-in-class performance at a modest price premium. The U.S. laundry category is growing again, up three points on a value basis across all outlets over the last six-month period. Within this, P&G share is growing. U.S. laundry detergent value share was up more than a point last fiscal year and grew again this quarter. Fabric enhancer share is up nearly a point over the same period. In U.S. Baby Care, strong innovation, consumer communication, trial programs, and a robust online presence have led to strong growth. P&G value share of U.S. diapers was up more than 1.5 points last fiscal year and was up 0.5 point again this quarter. We just launched our latest Pampers premium tier innovation, and we expect it to help us sustain this strong momentum. Baby Care results have been soft in other markets. To address this, we've accelerated premium innovations on both taped and pull-on diapers to restore our competitiveness at the top end of the market. We're strengthening our selling resources and programs for baby stores, and we're improving our point-of-market entry programs to deliver higher awareness and trial of Pampers among new moms. The largest male and female grooming brands, Gillette's Fusion and Venus, have proven to be and will continue to be huge platforms for our blade and razor innovation. We've continued the growth of Fusion with the big, obvious, and preferred FlexBall innovation that launched in the U.S. last year. We began rolling out the FlexBall technology in parts of Europe and Asia at the beginning of this calendar year. In less than 18 months, we've put 25 million Fusion FlexBall razors into the hands of men around the world, and we've recently launched into markets in Latin America and Central and Eastern Europe. We've also extended the FlexBall technology to Venus, the best-selling women's razor in the world, with the Venus Swirl innovation. We're continuing to innovate at the top end of the market to extend the product performance advantage we already enjoy over all competitors. Our new cartridge upgrade will launch in just a few months. We're supporting a broader range of our product ladder, from our best product, Fusion FlexBall, to MACH3 systems, to premium-priced and superior performance disposables with strong consumer value communication. We're innovating in store, helping retailers move out of the lock boxes on the shelves and at checkout with the use of hard tags. Hard tags make Gillette much easier to shop. They take up less space on shelves so more product can be put on a peg, reducing out-of-stocks and improving sales closure rates, and they're very effective at reducing shrink. We've already made the change in several hundred stores with excellent results, and we'll be rolling out hard tags as fast as we can in the year ahead. We're also innovating online. With more men purchasing their blades and razors through e-commerce, it's critical that Gillette establishes itself as the online leader. Gillette's online Shave Club launched in June and is off to a very good start, with e-commerce share of blades and razors up four points since launch. We're building partnerships with e-tailers and retailers. We're offering our shoppers subscription tie-ins for the Gillette Shave Club. Gillette is now consistently number one in paid search and has gone from number 50 to number two in organic shave club search. Importantly, Gillette's product is significantly consumer preferred over any and all shave club competition, winning on closeness, smoothness, comfort, and 18 other attributes tested, including importantly, overall better shaves. We have a strong innovation plan coming to market in China to capture more of the fast-growing premium tier segment. We're leveraging premium Baby Care innovations in both the taped and pull-on segments. We're launching compact Ariel liquid detergents that consumers prefer over competition, and we have new upgrades coming soon on Tide. We've made meaningful product and packaging improvements in Hair Care that launched last quarter on both Head & Shoulders and Pantene. And we're investing to improve the capabilities of our go-to-market operations, strengthening our relationships and presence with key e-commerce and specialty retailers, the fastest-growing segments of the Chinese retail market. We're increasing our investment in consumer awareness, point-of-market entry sampling, and trial across product categories. These moves take time to fully implement, but we're confident they will result in stronger growth over time, just as they've done in U.S. Baby Care and the Fabric Care business. So it continues to be a challenging environment. Against this backdrop, we continue to improve productivity, to transform our supply chain, to focus our portfolios, and to invest in superior consumer preferred brands and products. Cash flow is very strong as are underlying economics. We're investing in the future and are confident we'll return to positive organic top line growth next quarter. While it's not yet complete and it's only one month and while we face our toughest comp in December, we're off to a good start, with our October organic sales growth at 3% so far. With that, let me get into the details of the quarter we just completed and the fiscal year outlook; two housekeeping items before I begin. First, the organic sales and core earnings results we're reporting today are based on our 10 core product categories. The results of the Beauty and Batteries businesses that we're in the process of exiting are reported as discontinued operations. In September we provided an informational 8-K presenting historical results on this same basis. Second, starting this period we are no longer consolidating the results of our Venezuelan subsidiaries into our reported numbers. As I mentioned previously, organic sales were down 1% for the quarter versus the prior year. China and Brazil were large drivers of the sales decline, accounting for one point of total company sales growth headwind. We estimate that category and SKU cleanup efforts drove up to another point of sales decline. All-in sales were down 12%, including a nine point headwind from foreign exchange and two points from the Venezuela deconsolidation and other minor brand divestitures. Core gross margin and core operating margin both improved on both an all-in and ex-currency basis, driven by productivity savings. Core gross margin increased 250 basis points versus the prior year. Excluding foreign exchange, core gross margin was up 310 basis points. Core operating margin was up 270 points versus the prior year behind 260 basis points of productivity savings. On a constant currency basis, core operating margin was up 320 basis points. The core effective tax rate was 24%, up 1.5 points versus the prior year, a $0.02 per share drag on core earnings per share. Core earnings per share were $0.98, down 1% versus the prior quarter. This includes a 13 percentage point foreign exchange headwind, nearly $400 million after tax. On a constant currency basis, core earnings per share grew 12%. On an all-in GAAP basis, earnings per share were $0.91 for the quarter, up 32% versus the prior year. We generated $3 billion in free cash flow, yielding 101% adjusted free cash flow productivity. We returned approximately $2.4 billion to shareholders through a combination of $1.9 billion in dividend and $0.5 billion in share repurchase. Moving to guidance, as we said last quarter, we expect fiscal 2016 to be a year, given market volatility, FX headwinds, and pricing, of modest top line growth, solid core operating income growth, robust constant currency core earnings per share growth, and strong 90% to 100% adjusted free cash flow productivity. We're maintaining our outlook for organic sales growth of in line to up low single digits versus fiscal 2015. We've been investing to increase awareness and trial of our brands and products in North America, which is a key catalyst for growth in categories like Fabric Care and Grooming. We're starting to see the benefits, and this should improve in the second half of the year. We're launching a number of new consumer-preferred premium innovations over the next few months and early in the second half of the fiscal year in both developed and developing markets. We're investing in selling coverage to capitalize on opportunities in the fastest growing channels and strengthen our presence in our most important markets. All these efforts along with annualizing some of the most significant impacts from last fiscal year give us confidence in a stronger second quarter and second half. The headwind from foreign exchange has increased since the start of year. We now expect FX will have a five to six percentage point impact on all-in sales growth. Also, the combined impact of the Venezuela deconsolidation and minor brand divestures will have a two to three percentage point drag on all-in sales growth. Taken together, we expect all-in sales to be down high single digits versus restated fiscal 2015 results. Bottom line outcomes are, frankly, much more difficult to assess given the market and foreign exchange rate volatility. For now, we're maintaining our outlook for core earnings per share growth of slightly below to up mid-single digits versus year ago. We will invest where it's appropriate to do so. We will not cut smart investment to offset foreign exchange impacts, which means we could very well end up below the guidance range. On the other hand, we're working to accelerate and enhance productivity, and commodities have generally been a help. We'll see how things develop, and we'll update you as needed. We're also maintaining our all-in GAAP earnings per share growth outlook of up 53% to 63%. With continued strong operating margin expansion, we expect to deliver core operating income growth of mid to high single digits. This includes the $0.05 to $0.06 per share drag on operating earnings from the deconsolidation of results in our Venezuelan business, and it includes $0.02 to $0.03 per share of Beauty deal transition costs that will remain in our core earnings results. So strong underlying operating earnings progress, which excluding the $0.08 impact from these items should be up high singles to low double digits. Our key assumptions on items below the core operating profit line have not changed. We continue to expect non-operating income will be a two to three percentage point drag on core earnings per share growth, mainly impacting the fourth quarter. The core effective tax rate should be about 24% for fiscal 2016, about three points higher than last year. Combined, non-operating income and tax will be a six to seven percentage point impact on core earnings per share growth. Finally and importantly, we expect to retire shares at a value of approximately $8 billion to $9 billion through a combination of direct share repurchase and shares that will be exchanged in the Duracell transaction. In addition to the shares we expect to retire, we expect dividend payments of more than $7 billion, in total $15 billion to $16 billion in dividend payments, share exchanges, and share repurchase. Going forward, we are committed to balanced top and bottom line growth and strong free cash flow productivity to drive total shareholder return. We will address gaps if and when they emerge. We will defend our positions. And we will invest behind trial and awareness programs, and of course consumer-preferred innovation. We'll do everything we can from a productivity standpoint. We'll smartly invest to accelerate top line growth, and we'll continue delivering on our commitment of strong cash return to shareholders. That concludes our prepared remarks for this morning. As a reminder, business segment information is provided in our press release and will be available in slides, which will be posted on our website, www.PG.com, following the call. With that, I'd be happy to take your questions. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Chris Ferrara, Wells Fargo. Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hey, thanks. Jon, I guess can you quantify the gross margin impact maybe of some of that category SKU cleanup that you're doing? And then I guess as a follow-up to that, how long does it last? I think the three examples you gave were maybe 10 basis points each. You said 100 basis points, which is a pretty big deal. I guess how long has that been going on? How long do think it lasts? What's the gross margin impact of it? And then if you can, the outlook into October, what's been going on? How much of that is maybe some of this going away? What drives the confidence in October being sticky? Thank you. Jon R. Moeller - Chief Financial Officer : So I would say that we are midway through the portfolio cleanup of the core businesses. For example, the Mexico tissue towel move really was just effective in July. The Laundry moves span the end of last fiscal year and the beginning of this fiscal year. So we're about in the middle of that with still some more work to do, so that will continue to have an impact on the top line. Obviously, as you point out, that's a gross margin accretive endeavor. I honestly haven't worked to calculate that specifically, Chris, so we'll have to give you some perspective offline on that. Relative to confidence in Q2 and going forward, there are several things that drive us from where we are to where we'll be. The big core businesses that we've been working on are continuing to strengthen. So I talked about Fabric Care and Baby Care in the U.S., where market growth has improved as a result of innovation in the category, where our shares are continuing to increase. Baby Care actually we're selling through our capacity currently and are on allocation, so that will come off over time and that will be a help. Importantly, some of the other structural items we've been working to address, we've talked Mexico. We've talked China. Mexico is progressing very nicely. They had a quarter that I think indexed 98 versus a year ago, which is up pretty significantly from where it's been, and we expect that to turn to a positive index next quarter. China we also expect progress as we bring these premium innovations to market, as I described, and as we continue to draw down some of the inventory that's in the trade. And also, as I mentioned, we're increasing investment where it makes sense in smart ways to drive trial and sampling of our products, particularly at points of market entry and points of market change, and the early returns on those are encouraging. So that's the simple story going forward. Again, we're fairly confident that the second quarter will be a quarter of growth organically on the top line. And we're fairly confident that the growth will strengthen as we move through the fiscal year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz, Deutsche Bank. William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, Jon. Good morning. Jon R. Moeller - Chief Financial Officer : Good morning, Bill. William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, can we talk about the EM versus developed market growth, so what the two growth rates were? And then how much do you think of the market share softness is you guys deciding to exit categories versus just losing to competitors? And then how long do you think that is going to last? So are we a point at P&G where the big negative mix from emerging markets will be cleaned up in the not too distant future because you've exited a lot of this low-end stuff, which was horribly gross margin dilutive, because obviously historically some of the low-margin mix stuff in emerging markets on that business grew so rapidly, had a huge onerous impact on the company broadly? So have you made significant progress on that front where the negative mix on the emerging markets business will be a lot less going forward? Jon R. Moeller - Chief Financial Officer : So the split of organic sales growth developed/developing, developed was minus 1%, developing was minus 2%. I mentioned in the prepared remarks that Brazil and China were significant impacts in driving that minus 2% in developing, as was, as you rightly point out, some of the portfolio cleanup efforts, which are disproportionately developing market activities. Yes, as Chris asked, they will improve gross margin. They will improve operating margin. And yes, that will help reduce negative mix impact from disproportionate growth should it resume in developing markets. As I mentioned in my response to Chris's answer, there is still work to do. So if this was a quarter or next quarter was a quarter where developing markets grew faster than developed markets, we would still have a negative mix on the margin line, but it is getting better. Operator : Your next question comes line from the line of John Faucher, JPMorgan. John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks. Jon, you guys talk a lot about competitive activity in the press release and it's mentioned for each GBU, which I guess relates to your view of FX-related pricing versus your competitors' view of FX-related pricing. So can you talk a little bit about why you guys feel the need to maybe take more pricing than what you're seeing? Is that just simply okay, European-based companies see less of a need, what have you? Because I guess it seems like you might be better off maybe taking less pricing and delivering 100 basis points of gross margin expansion versus 250 basis points. So how should we think about that balance and why you guys maybe need to take more pricing than your competitors? Jon R. Moeller - Chief Financial Officer : We start from a position of a stronger currency than many of our competitors. So I mentioned in the prepared remarks, Russia is an example of what we're dealing with, 40% devaluation. Both euro and yen functional currency competitors are dealing with about 20%. So that dollar dynamic against all currencies, including the euro and the yen, drives a bigger issue. That doesn't mean that we will necessarily price more. We need to be pragmatic in what we do. I've talked before about recovering less through pricing this time around and recovering more through a combination of mix and cost savings, which we are doing. We're in the period of the cycle where we have made our moves. We're typically first in that endeavor just because of the fact that we're the market leaders in many of these markets, and competitors are beginning to respond. I obviously can't talk in a lot of granularity about pricing from a competitive standpoint. But what I will tell you is that the moves in the market are generally constructive, not all constructive and not all well understood. This is something we'll continue to work against every day, every week, and we'll do it very pragmatically. I'm not interested in price levels that are not sustainable. Obviously, our consumers are not interested in those levels of pricing either. But for example, in Russia where we had negative gross margins as a result of currency devaluation, we simply have to make a move. Making a choice to maintain stronger top line growth with negative margins is just a value-destructive activity. Operator : Your next question comes the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning. So, Jon, I'm still struggling a bit with the emerging markets trends. Obviously, the rationalization on the lower end is having some impact, but it's a business with nearly $25 billion in sales in aggregate. It's still kind of hard for me to understand conceptually how you guys are posting declines when most of your peers at least so far this quarter are more in the high single-digit or double-digit type of growth range. So I was just hoping you could give us a bit more detail on what you think is driving the underperformance. How much of it is the portfolio rationalization? Is there a greater macro impact, or what are the key factors behind it, again, on a relative basis, and then the plans to close that gap going forward? Thanks. Jon R. Moeller - Chief Financial Officer : Sure. The biggest \u2013 let's just talk BRIC markets. China, our second largest market, so it makes a significant difference both from a top line and bottom line standpoint, we have not fully accessed the opportunity that the market is presenting in terms of growth in the premium price tiers as consumers look for better, more differentiated solutions, and frankly, higher product quality. We are bringing those items to market now, but our absence in those price tiers has, frankly, hurt us fairly significantly. Diapers is a good example that I mentioned, where we're still the market leader with Pampers, but we're really not present in the portions of the market that are growing, which are the top tier, which will now be with both a pants and a taped offering. We've also talked about some trade channel and inventory cleanup that has been ongoing, and that work continues as well. So China was down 8% on the quarter on an organic basis. Russia is the next largest big developing market for us, and we've talked a little bit both in the prepared remarks and in the Q&A on some of the challenges that presents us. And we're the largest player again by a factor of three in both Russia and the Ukraine. So the impacts there are disproportional. Having said that, Russia is actually holding up fairly well, 2% organic sales growth in the quarter. When you consider everything that's going on, that's a pretty good number, but obviously well below the numbers that we were posting a year ago or two years ago. Brazil is very volatile. We just took some pricing there. It's hard to sort through the trends. Last quarter we were up 7%. This quarter we were down 12%. But if you look at consumption in the marketplace, it's essentially flat. So I think that's another one of those items that should reverse itself as we move forward here. And India, I've talked about the moves that we've made to increase profitability, albeit at some cost to the top line. I realize that's not an exhaustive comparison across the competitive set. But just with those four dynamics that I've described in those four big markets, I think it at least helps understand why our results in developing may not be as strong as some of the others and why that has a large impact on the company. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with UBS. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks, so I guess just a question on guidance. Versus the outlook a quarter ago, it looks like you're now expecting your overall top line three to four points worse than in early August, and obviously you held your EPS guidance for now. So I guess really two things. First, the two to three point headwind from minor brand divestitures and the deconsolidation of Venezuela, how much of that wasn't known a few months ago because Venezuela itself wasn't new this quarter, unless I'm mistaken? And then second, the new guidance seems to imply EBIT margins about 100 basis points better rough math versus the guidance a quarter ago when you factor in that top line reduction, which is $600 million \u2013 $700 million. So where is that margin being sourced from? I know you mentioned commodities. But planned productivity has to be a big role, and I'm just curious where that's going to be targeted. Jon R. Moeller - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Steve. The two to three points on Venezuela and divestitures is not new. You're absolutely right about that. We didn't explicitly talk it in the last call. We wanted to make sure that was clear, so we put it in this call. There's an implicit assumption that one has to make when one tries to determine how much more EBIT we're expecting, and that assumption is where we actually are in the guidance range. So while we've retained our range, that doesn't mean that we're necessarily at the top or the middle of that range. And there is a ton of moving pieces, as I indicated. There is some good news there relative to the productivity savings that you saw come through in the first quarter. Frankly, those were larger than we were expecting, and also there has been some commodity help. But honestly, as I tried to indicate in my prepared remarks, I'm not overly fixated right now on guidance or updating guidance simply because it's very difficult to do. What I'm fixated on is getting the right choices made, being as productive as we possibly can in doing that, and the guidance will be what it will be, but at this point no change. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citi. Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi. I have just a couple quick follow-ups and then a real question. My first follow-up is in terms of the gross margin specifically, I have to go back five years to find a first quarter that has a gross margin as strong as the one you've put up. And are you saying, just in terms of net of investments, was the gross margin you put up a function of product mix and the pricing you've taken, et cetera, et cetera? Is this a new base for the first quarter gross margin, or do you feel like if you could turn the clock back, you should have spent more and maybe this gross margin is going to prove to have been inflated? My second follow-up is just, again, I hear you say that your outlook for global category growth has gone from 4% to 3%. If that's the case, why do you still feel like you can put up the same organic growth that you did before? I don't understand why you wouldn't have brought that down in concert with that change. And then sorry for the last question, but over the last month we've seen the news that Tarek [Farahat] is leaving from Brazil, and Martin [Riant] is leaving. And the last time we had a really new CEO when Bob came in, there was an enormous amount of transition in management. And I think my take was that that led to an enormous amount of volatility and disruption across the organization. So the question is do you expect \u2013 is the number of management transitions and changes to continue? Do you think there are going to be more? And if that's the case, how is David going to manage this transition and period of change better than Bob [McDonald] did because it seems like more change is not what you need right now? Thank you. Jon R. Moeller - Chief Financial Officer : On gross margin, we've mentioned productivity. We've mentioned pricing. We've mentioned commodities. All of those impacted the gross margin results we delivered. John [Chevalier] can give you the details offline. But within the gross margin number of 250 basis points, 170 basis points of that is savings, there's 80 basis points of pricing benefit, there's 110 basis points of commodity benefit, and then there are of course some offsets to that. So how much of that is sustainable going forward? The commodities will sustain itself until it annualizes, obviously, and so that's probably as big as it's going to get. And pricing will also annualize itself over time. We would hope that some level of productivity savings in cost of goods would continue as we continue to localize production and sourcing and as we continue to increase the efficiency of our manufacturing operations. In terms of the organic top line, again, this is a question of ranges in a sense. Our guidance is flat to up low singles. The quarter we just posted was minus 1%. We're talking about improvement in Q2, with strengthening beyond that. So even if Q2 was zero, which we're not anticipating, and the back half was plus 1%, we'd still be within that guidance range. So we just don't see a reason to change the guidance range. Where we come out within that is a matter that we'll have to work against and a matter that you'll have to assess. In terms of organization change, I really don't want to speak for David. He'll begin interacting with this group shortly, and I'll let him communicate his view on that. My view is we have a very strong team. I believe we have made changes. We've both made changes and individuals have made changes relative to their own plans as a result of the announcements that have been made and as a result of the situation in the business. So I don't see a period personally of very high volatility in management staffing going forward. I think this period will be characterized by a lot more continuity than, frankly, either when the transition with Bob occurred or has been the case over the last year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks, good morning, so a couple things, two follow-ups just like Wendy had, and then a separate one. So first was just on the Venezuela deconsolidation and product exits. I got a little more confused, Jon. You had said that you guys had always included in the guidance but we weren't aware of it, so you're just being more explicit this quarter. But yet the net sales guidance did get worse, so I'm just a little confused. Why call it out now? Jon R. Moeller - Chief Financial Officer : Yes. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Something did change. Okay, so that's one. Two is you mentioned in the introduction in your first bit of prepared remarks about making value investments and then nothing afterward. So I was curious where you've maybe adjusted pricing a little bit, maybe in Russia went a little bit too far, so anything there. And then finally, it was also in the press release. I thought the language was interesting about we will invest smartly, like future tense, not currently. So you gave some examples I think of where you're already maybe investing at a full load, like Fabric and Baby in the U.S. But where are areas that you're not yet investing at what you would call a full level? And does that imply that maybe marketing spending starts to climb up again in the second half as you have more of this innovation or product plans in place that you're comfortable supporting? Thanks. Jon R. Moeller - Chief Financial Officer : Okay. On the top line, the change quarter to quarter is really FX in terms of what causes us to take that all-in number down. And again, John can take you through the details there, but that's the primary driver of the change. In terms of investments in consumer value equation, you're right that we did roll back some of the price increases that we took in Russia, consistent with our ongoing dialogue about how we'll manage that situation. I want to be very careful about price signaling, so I can't really talk about decisions that have been made to address additional price gaps, but those decisions have been made. And that's the case both in developing markets but also some developed market price gaps that need to be addressed. And on the question of investment, yes, we expect marketing to increase this year on both an absolute basis and a percentage of sales basis. By marketing, I mean working dollars, so we're going to continue to fund increases in spending that matters with reduction in spending that doesn't. And look, if I was asked to spend an additional $1 billion tomorrow, I could obviously do that, but that's not the question. The question is can we earn a return on that and create value through that investment. And as we have more to invest behind, and you rightly mentioned the product portfolio, for example, as we're bringing these innovations to market, we will do that. I think you saw \u2013 I don't have the numbers right in front of me. But in your conference in Boston in the fall, we showed pretty significant increases in marketing support where we did have a reason to invest behind unit dose in Laundry in the U.S., behind the Hair Care innovations, et cetera. So look, let me just be as clear as I can about this. We don't like the top line situation. We don't accept the top line situation. We will fix the top line situation, but we need to do that in ways that are smart and sustainable. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello with Raymond James. Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, guys. Good morning. First question I guess for you, Jon, in terms of the EPS guide for this year, I'm just trying to bridge it from last year $3.76 because if you look at the headwinds you guys have, I know you're well aware of this, they add up to about somewhere between $0.60 and $0.65 by our math. So I'm just trying to figure out what the positives are here. Obviously, the cost of goods savings you guys have called out is $1.2 billion, but I'm not sure if you guys have talked about the tailwind from commodities this year. I've got roughly $400 million in my notes here and maybe what kind of overhead savings you guys are expecting to try to bridge that $0.65 gap, if you will, number one. And then number two, if you look at Duracell and the Beauty brands you guys are selling, obviously you are selling them but they're still part of your business. So how much of a distraction are they in terms of your day-to-day operations until you do divest those businesses? Thanks. Jon R. Moeller - Chief Financial Officer : So the other drivers of improvement, you mentioned commodities. You're in the order, right order of magnitude, probably $450 million. It's gotten a little better. There are overhead savings. We had pretty significant reductions in enrollment last year. There are non-working marketing savings I mentioned in the prepared remarks, another $200 million reduction in marketing, and those are all things that are helping us. In terms of the distraction on the businesses that we're running through discontinued operations, I wouldn't label it in any way a distraction. We're fully committed to optimize and manage those businesses just as if we still own them because, guess what, we do. What we haven't been able to do and what I look forward to being able to do, I know we all look forward to being able to do, is as those divestitures close, being able to focus all of our energy and effort on these 10 product categories where we feel very confident we can make a difference. So that is not fully activated, if you will, as we continue managing the business, frankly, much as we did last year. Operator : Your next question comes to the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great, thank you. First on the savings, you had a very good start to the year and probably better than you guys had expected. So first, can you talk about the sustainability of that? Because in past years you've tended to see the savings build as the year progresses. So has the cadence of that changed or could we even see more in terms of a savings acceleration there? And then just on the top line, I understand clearly there has been a ton of change over the last, let's call it, 24 months, the productivity improvements, the transformation of the portfolio, the exit of less profitable businesses. But even if you add back those minor divestitures, you still would have probably put up an organic sales decline or you would have put up an organic sales decline in three of the five segments. So you gave some examples about Brazil and China and a couple of other geographies. But can you talk through what's underlying that? Maybe what are you factoring in terms of macros when you look for that acceleration in growth as the year progresses? Thank you. Jon R. Moeller - Chief Financial Officer : Sure. So the savings number was indeed significant. And as I said, it was more actually than we were expecting to see. We were very happy to see that, and that gives us more confidence in our savings objectives going forward. As with past years, the incremental savings should build as the year goes on. The area that there will be less sequential progress is in overhead, simply because the reduction this year is not as significant as it was last year. And from a marketing standpoint, we're going to be spending those savings back behind the things that we've been talking about. So I actually haven't looked at the quarter-by-quarter cadence. I've been working to get this quarter wrapped up, but I know John can give you some perspective on that. In terms of the top line, the simple way to look at it, I would argue that on an adjusted basis or an underlying basis, top line is currently growing at about 1%, which again is nothing we're happy with. How do I get from minus 1% to 1%? There's about a point of the portfolio cleanup. There's also about a point of one-time impacts. So for example, I mentioned that we're selling through our capacity on Baby Care in the U.S., and that's constraining the amount of growth that's possible. We're making adjustments, for example, in inventory levels. We're through that in Mexico. We're getting through that in China. So if you take all of that out, and by the way, I'm not suggesting one should, I'm just trying to answer your question, you get to about a plus 1% running rate. And from there, as I mentioned, when we're able to fully activate the things that are working and address some of the things that aren't working, that should accelerate. There's no reason that we should be comfortable with growth that's any less than the rate of the market growth over time. I'm not talking about a quarter here or quarter there but in total, and that's what we're committed to work towards. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research. Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Hello. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to come back to this issue of volatility in emerging markets because there is an internal element to it, meaning pricing decisions. And I'm glad to learn that Russia and Mexico are normalizing, but there were deep contractions in the prior quarter, and they were caused either because too much promotions or too heavy price increases. Now China is down 8%, baby and diapers are down 3% \u2013 4% at a time that they should have benefited from big launches that A.G. [Lafley] has spoken being rolled out in July. So why this volatility is not self-inflicted, if you will, and is not a byproduct of head count reductions and changes in the role of the GBUs and local markets that you now call SMOs [Sales and Market Operations]? Thank you. Jon R. Moeller - Chief Financial Officer : First of all, to address specifically the point of minus 3% in Babies and Family, that's driven by a couple things. One, in Feminine Care, we're comping the big launch of Discreet, the adult incontinence product, so that has an impact. Two, I mentioned the Family Care choices and I mentioned their one point impact on that category. Three, I mentioned Baby Care softness outside the U.S. and the fact that we're really just getting the products in the marketplace in China that will allow us to compete with effectiveness in the premium tier. So really it's not self-induced volatility. It's those things that I just described. In terms of pricing for FX in an uncertain competitive and consumer environment, there will be volatility. We need to work to get that as right as we can and reduce the volatility, but I don't think it's just a realistic expectation that there won't be any of that volatility. I think we also confuse ourselves a little bit when we look quarter to quarter. These things always have big impacts, usually first positive, and then negative; positive as you announce a price increase and volume sells in ahead of that price increase, negative afterwards as that inventory is drawn down and as consumers adjust to the new pricing in the marketplace. So this is somewhat of just a reality of our times, if you will. Again, I don't excuse the need to be as proficient and effective and efficient in this area as we need to be. That's certainly what we're striving for. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. I have a few things. One is just to know if Dave Taylor will be on these quarterly calls or just on the fiscal year-end call. Two, why are you not buying back more stock if you think things will improve? It only looks like $0.5 billion. And then on that improvement story, we've had false starts on the same kind of discourse or soliloquy before, I think. Correct me if I'm wrong, but you guys haven't been happy with your top line for a while. So why should investors believe you this time that things will improve? And specifically on this volume point, again, we've seen that every segment says competitive activity and price increases were negative on volume. What tactically are you doing differently? What are you bringing to bear differently now to get out of that situation? And specifically, I want to know if it's finally, finally, finally closing some of these price gaps versus your competition where you're losing share, this tight fisted (53:40) image that we at least have, or are you just waiting and hoping for competition to go away as FX eases? Because you do say building awareness, you do say sometimes closing value gaps, but I really want to know if we should expect your price gaps to close where you're losing share and what you're modeling for your competitive response in that instance. Jon R. Moeller - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Ali. Honestly, David and I have not had a chance to talk about how we're going to proceed going forward with the totality of investor interaction. But he will be certainly well represented, is already interacting with investors. We have a day scheduled here November 4, I think some of you know \u2013 November 5, and he'll join us for that as well. So we will get David fully involved, and we'll update you on just exactly how that's going to work when we have a better view of that. In terms of your comment on dialogue versus soliloquy, I certainly hope that this is a dialogue. That's what I look forward to. I get no value out of a soliloquy. And you've been good in this regard in terms of maintaining a very active dialogue, which I appreciate. On the question on price gaps and where we're losing share, I would say things fall into three or four buckets, and it's not one solution solves everything. There are some places like the bad businesses I've described where losing share is the right thing to do. And so those share losses we're going to work to get behind us and get to a profitable position so that growth is worth something. There are cases, as I've mentioned, where we do need to adjust pricing, and we will do that. There are other cases where improvement in the value equation that's required to reverse share loss comes through a much better product offering, where the benefits of that offering are much more clearly communicated to consumers. And it comes with getting that preferred, better product in consumers' hands, not just telling them about it, but allowing them to experience it. I talked about investments in sampling and trial. We frankly haven't been as strong as we need to be at key sampling and trial opportunities, specifically points of market entry and points of market change, and we're strengthening our programs there. I mentioned putting 25 million FlexBall razors in the hands of men across the world. Telling them about that product is one thing. Putting it in their hands changes the dynamic pretty significantly. And another example where we're working to strengthen that is in Laundry, where we're increasing our washing machine sampling, and importantly, we're doing that for the first time with unit dose. So consumers get to experience our best, most convenient product as they set up their household. So it's really across the board. But yes, where we do need to address value gaps, we will. Again, how you do that is going to differ by individual situation. On share repurchase, we're committed to the same amount of repurchase that I described on the last call. That hasn't changed. Recall that with the Duracell transaction, there's a significant cash component. And so we've been managing our share repurchase pattern, if you will, with full knowledge of that. That is coming up in the first part of the year, and also with an eye towards what our credit metrics are. But we will repurchase shares on an increasing rate as we move forward here. Operator : Your next question comes the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey. Good morning, Jon. Jon R. Moeller - Chief Financial Officer : Hi, Jason. Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks for squeezing me in. I wanted to touch on a couple of questions that others have already touched on. It was encouraging to hear your comments in regards to John Faucher's question about competitors generally beginning to follow your lead on pricing. But I think a few other instances you've referenced, you may be positioning to go the other way on a go-forward. And I was intrigued by your comment of increasing investment at points of market entry and points of market change. That sounded like a fancy way of saying more promotions, more sampling, more couponing. So A), is that the right interpretation? And B), back to Ali's question, what do you expect competitors to do on a go-forward, and could that even create more problems down the road? And the second part, sticking with point of sale and execution, you're fairly far in now to the change in merchandising in the U.S. with the partnership with Acosta and Kraft. Can you update us on what you've learned, how it's progressed, and maybe how it's changing as you evolve with those learnings, and of course, Kraft changes ownership hands? Thank you. Jon R. Moeller - Chief Financial Officer : We will not, in most cases, be looking to promotion as a way to strengthen our business. We will be competitive where we need to be, but that is not going to be something that we proactively increase. We may increase trade spending at any point in time as a mechanism of adjusting price, but generally that's not our game. If you look at price, which includes promotion as a driver of top line, it had a two point \u2013 it was a two point positive impact in the quarter we just completed. It's been a positive impact for the last 20 quarters and a positive impact for the last 11 years. So we are not going to be using that as a way to improve our situation, but we will remain competitive. The reason for that is fairly straightforward. There's nothing that is really proprietary in that. So as you rightly indicated, that's the mechanism we use to adjust every value equation. That can be undone very quickly and very easily. We'd much prefer to establish superior value equations with superior products that are adequately supported. And that's also the reason why maybe the top line isn't turning as quickly as certainly we would like or understandably as you would like because we're not going to spend money just to spend money. We're not going to spend money in ways that are not sustainable in terms of generating growth in a profitable way on our business. And I apologize, Jason, I'm just not that familiar with the Acosta/Kraft dynamics at a granular level, so I need to pass on that one. But again, we can try to get you that perspective offline. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust. William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks, good morning. Hey, Jon, just to follow up on David Taylor, who will start in 10 days, should we view everything you've been saying and the state of the state as part of the way he's thinking, or is there a timeframe beyond the November meeting or sometime by year end that he's going to lay out any kind of different path? I'm just trying to understand that. And then just as a follow-up, is the timing on Duracell still March-ish? Is that what you were saying? Jon R. Moeller - Chief Financial Officer : The timing on Duracell should be the January \u2013 March quarter. And within that, I don't have a month nailed down, but it should be in that quarter. Obviously, from a substance standpoint, I don't want to front-run David and so do not want to be representing his point of view. I want him to represent his point of view. We will look for opportunities to do that as soon as it's practical. Obviously, he starts November 1. We get pretty quickly into the holiday season then. And so at minimum, what we've said is that David will join us when we're all together at CAGNY. And I think also by that time, you can have some more conviction on what he indicates the path forward is simply because he'll have had the appropriate amount of time to develop that thinking. But as I said, we'll look for any opportunity we can to increase exposure as time goes on. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks and good morning, everybody. Jon, I wanted to understand a little bit \u2013 vet maybe the balance of the price and volume going forward. Just broadly, what is in your expectations for the year, and then perhaps if that's changed along with expectations for global growth rates? Jon R. Moeller - Chief Financial Officer : We do expect improvement in volume as we go through the year. It will be lower than sales, so pricing will be a bigger driver for the balance of the year. Obviously, that gap will narrow as we go through quarter by quarter. I apologize, I forgot the second part of your question. But you can feel free to call me, I apologize. Operator : Your final question comes the line of Alicia Forry with Canaccord. Alicia A. Forry - Canaccord Genuity Ltd.: Hi, thanks for squeezing me in. Most of my questions have been answered here. But just to press you a bit more on the competitive activity that we've all been focusing on, I was wondering if you could give us any color on whether that has intensified at all versus recent trends, or if it's more of the same, just a bit weaker generally around the world, but some more color. And then, if you could, possibly contrast the competitive activity that you're seeing in emerging markets versus mature markets, if there are any significant differences in the nature of that competition. And then just finally, on disposals, I know that at the Coty call you guys said that basically you've completed your intended major disposals. But I was just wondering if maybe could we see a handful of the larger non-core brands being sold over the next 12 to 18 months because it looks to me like there are still possible areas that could be considered non-core to the strategy. Thanks. Jon R. Moeller - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Alicia. The competitive activity we're seeing is actually pretty constructive, as I mentioned earlier, both on the pricing front and on the product front. So the big driver of competition, for example, in China in Baby Care, is product-based innovation at the premium end. That's very constructive from a market standpoint. If we look at competitive activity, for instance, in the Laundry market in the U.S., take Personal as an example, that's product-based innovation at the premium end. We haven't been as well positioned as we need to be to respond to some of that, some of those moves, like for instance in Baby Care in China. But it's generally constructive. There are pockets here and there where things happen that we wouldn't have chosen, but broadly good competition. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference.

P&G would like to remind you that today's discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections. Also, as required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with valuable information on the underlying growth trends of the business and has posted on its website, www.PG.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP and other financial measures. Now I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller. Jon Moeller : Good morning. In the quarter we just completed, we continued reducing costs and reinvested in growth, reaccelerating our top line and delivering strong earnings and cash flow. Organic sales increased 2%. Core earnings per share increased 9% with constant currency core earnings per share up 21%. We delivered meaningful triple-digit basis point improvements in gross and operating margins on both a constant currency and all-in basis. All-in GAAP earnings per share were up 37% and adjusted free cash flow productivity was 117%.  This is a reasonably strong quarter which reflects our efforts to accelerate organic top line and earnings per share growth fueled by productivity savings. We continue to operate, though, in a very challenging and volatile macro environment. Market growth rates on both a volume and value basis have decelerated due mainly to slower growth in developing markets. We entered the year expecting the market to grow close to 3% to 4% globally. We now expect 2% to 3%.  There are more flashpoints across the globe than at any time in recent memory with significant economic and political instability impacting incomes and consumption in many large and important markets : Russia, the Ukraine, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the balance of the Middle East, Turkey, Nigeria, Argentina, Venezuela and Brazil. Currencies are weakening across the board, more than three-quarters of a billion dollars since the start of the fiscal and over a $1 billion after-tax versus year ago. This is on top of a $1.5 billion impact last fiscal year and nearly a $1 billion impact the year before. Across three years, FX has been a $3.5 billion impact over 30% of fiscal year 2013 core net earnings after-tax. Since the start of December, the current year FX headwind has increased by $300 million after-tax with a 40% devaluation in Argentina and additional 15% devaluation in Russia and nearly a 10% devaluation in Mexico.  The relative strength of the dollar weighs heavier on us than our euro and yen functional currency competitors. The dollar has more than doubled against the ruble over the past two years while our euro functional competitors are facing about 50% to 60% of that impact. We expect these dynamics : slowing market growth, geopolitical hot spots and a stronger dollar will continue to be part of our reality going forward. Against this backdrop, we\u2019re staying focused on big opportunities in our control, executing what is the largest transformation in our company's history, without changing productivity, transforming our portfolio and strengthening category business models and innovation plans. This transformation strategy, as we\u2019ll explain more at CAGNY, is fundamentally a growth strategy.  I\u2019ll talk briefly about each of these focus areas : productivity, portfolio, and business model and innovation plans before we get into the details of the quarter.  We continued to dramatically improve productivity with significant upside still ahead. Our original five-year cost of goods savings target was $6 billion. We expect to deliver over $7 billion by the end of this year, 15% above our initial target.  We\u2019ve reduced manufacturing enrollment by 15% over the last three years. This includes new staffing necessary to support capacity addition. On a same site basis, manufacturing enrollment is down nearly 20%. We\u2019re targeting 25% to 30% cumulative reduction by the end of fiscal 2017. In February 2012, we announced we will reduce non-manufacturing overhead by 10% over five years. As of December 31, we\u2019ve reduced these roles by 23%, more than double the original target and are well on track to meet our revised target of 25% to 30% by the end of fiscal 2017. In fact, we currently expect to reach our 25% to 30% objective this year, one year ahead of schedule. These figures exclude divestitures \u2013 including divestitures we will reduce non-manufacturing roles by over 35%.  Continued digitization has been and will be a big enabler of our overhead and manufacturing enrollment efficiencies. We\u2019re reducing non-working marketing expenditures -- costs that do not impact reach, do not impact frequency. Last year we reduced the number of agencies we worked with by nearly 40% and cut agency and production spending by about $370 million. We\u2019re aiming for an additional $200 million of agency-related savings this year. These are non-working savings that enable us to invest in advertising and in trial of consumer-preferred products. We\u2019re strengthening our working marketing programs -- greater reach, higher frequency, greater effectiveness, at less overall marketing costs. Last fiscal year in the US we increased total marketing and merchandising support behind Pantene by 440 basis points, increased Tide brand spending by 220 basis points and invested an additional 150 basis points in Fusion behind the new FlexBall innovation. This year we\u2019ve made similar increases to advertising programs in the US on Shave Care, Fabric Care; in Brazil on Baby Care and Fabric Care; in China on Fabric Care and Oral Care. In North America alone, we\u2019ve added nearly 100 basis points to advertising and in-store merchanting budgets since we started the fiscal year.  In addition to cost of goods sold, overhead and non-working marketing cost reduction, we are driving balance sheet productivity. Inventory days are down. Payable days are up. The moves we made on the balance sheet have enabled us to extend our long track record of very strong adjusted free cash flow productivity, 102% last fiscal year, 101% in Q1, 117% in Q2.  We continue to maintain our position as one of the strongest cash generators among competitive peers and comparable mega-cap companies. We\u2019re also among the top companies in returning cash to shareholders. In fiscal 2015, we increased our dividend for the 59th consecutive year and returned $11.9 billion in cash to shareholders, a 105% of adjusted net earnings. Over the past five years we have returned $60 billion to shareholders and intend to pay dividends, retire shares, and repurchase shares worth up to $70 billion over just the next four years.  In addition to transforming our cost structure, we\u2019re transforming our portfolio. As you know we\u2019re centering our portfolio on 10 category-based business units where P&G has leading market positions, strong brands and consumer-meaningful product technologies. These 10 categories have historically grown faster with higher margins than the balance of the company. We will be a company of consumer preferred brands and products in these 10 product categories. Within these core businesses, we are also focusing our offerings to maximize value creation. We\u2019re making smart choices for short, mid and long term value creation or going-bad business even when these choices create short-term topline pressure. In our Mexico family care business, we made a choice to discontinue low-tier unprofitable products in favor of very profitable, higher tier products, albeit with lower sales. The top-line drag from this choice will dissipate over the next few quarters and will have a solidly value accretive business going forward.  In India, we\u2019ve made a choice to de-prioritize several unprofitable lines of business which negatively impacts short-term top-line growth rates but will lead longer-term to much more profitable business that will grow strongly. Last fiscal year, organic sales growth slowed by several points but we made significant progress in improving local profit margin, up 700 basis points. We went from losing money in India to triple-digit profits.  In the quarter we just completed, India organic sales growth was only 2%. The strategic part of the business, the part that we\u2019re maintaining, grew a healthy 10%. Sales in the portion of the business we\u2019re fixing or exiting, which is about 15% of the total portfolio, were down 35%. Profit is running significantly ahead of even last year's improved levels. As we come out of this, we will have strong top-line growth that is really worth something. There is really no point to grow if it isn\u2019t worth something. Choices like this impacted our organic top line growth rate by about 1 point in the October-December quarter but will enable us to increase profitability on an ongoing basis.  As we\u2019ve improved productivity and sharpened our portfolio, we\u2019ve been strengthening business unit strategies, business models and product offerings putting particular priority against our four largest categories : Fabric Care, Baby Care, Grooming and Hair Care and our two largest markets : the US and China. We\u2019re focusing our laundry business on consumer preferred brands and product offerings like our premium performance and premium priced unit dosed detergents, and our market leading and market expanding scent bead fabric enhancers. We\u2019re launching better performing and more profitable new compact liquid detergents in Russia, Turkey, Mexico, Brazil and China.  In Russia and Turkey where we launched superior compact liquid detergents early last calendar year, P&G share of liquid detergents is up 7 and 11 points respectively. Fabric Care results in the US demonstrate what is possible when we get the strategy balanced and the innovation program focused on what matters most to consumers, superior value for best-in-class performance at a modest price premium.  The US laundry detergent category is continuing to grow, up more than 4 points on a value basis across all outlets over the last 3 to 6 month periods. Within this, our share is growing. P&G\u2019s US laundry detergent value share was up a point last fiscal year and was up a half a point in the December quarter. We will continue to be the innovation leader in Fabric Care. In North America, we\u2019re introducing a new regiment on Tide and Downy that addresses the odor problems common to athletic wear. 70% of consumers wear athletic gear multiple times each week. The Odor Defense collection anchored by innovation on Tide PODS brings the proprietary formula of enzymes and surfactants that break down and remove stubborn soils and residues for a great clean and fresh scent. Paired with the added cleaning power of Tide Odor Defense Rescue laundry booster and Downy fresh protect ordor defense beads, this regimen promises to eliminate odors from the fast-growing market of ath-leisure clothes people are wearing far beyond the gym.  In the US Baby Care, strong innovation, consumer communications, trial programs and a robust online presence have led to strong growth for Pampers. Pampers\u2019 value share of U.S. diapers was up more than a point and a half last fiscal year and was up a point in the December quarter. The progress is particularly encouraging considering our latest Pampers innovation with Extra Absorb Channels was on shipment allocation for much of the quarter as demand succeeded our initial supply. With increased capacity in place and continued strong demand, we expect a good start to the new calendar year. We\u2019re increasing our investments in Luvs diapers in the second half of the fiscal year to address share declines following a significant price reduction taken by our primary competitor.  Baby Care results have been softer in other markets. To address this, we\u2019ve strengthened our value proposition in several markets and accelerated premium innovation on taped and pull-on diapers to restore our competitiveness at the top end of the market. We're strengthening our selling resources and programs for baby stores, and we're improving our point-of-market entry programs to deliver higher awareness and trial of Pampers among new moms. The Gillette FlexBall innovation continues to deliver strong results in grooming. Globally an estimated 25 million men have tried FlexBall in 18 months since launch. FlexBall has been an important catalyst of growth of ProGlide cartridges. ProGlide cartridge sales grew 18% last fiscal year compared to a 7% decline in overall male cartridge market. ProGlide cartridge shares is up 2 to 3 points in each of the past 3, 6, and 12 month periods through December. The strong ProGlide results set a very positive stage for our next cartridge innovation : Gillette Fusion ProShield. ProShield with lubrication before and after the blades shields against irritation during every shave. Retailer response to ProShield has been outstanding, delivering launch orders and display levels well above targets.  We're supporting a broader range of our product ladder, from our best product, Fusion FlexBall, to MACH3 systems, to premium-priced and superior performance disposables with strong consumer value communication. We're innovating in store, helping retailers move out of the lock boxes on shelves and at checkout with the use of hard tags. Hard tags make Gillette much easier to shop. They take up less space on shelves so more product can be put on a peg, reducing out-of-stocks and improving sales closure rates, and they're very effective at reducing shrink. We've already made the change in several hundred stores with excellent results, and are rolling out hard tags as fast as we\u2019re able.  We're also innovating online. With more men purchasing their blades and razors through e-commerce, we\u2019re establishing Gillette as the online leader. While we were admittedly late to build out our online offering, Gillette Shave Club launched in June and is off to a very good start. We\u2019ve increased our e-commerce share of blades and razors more than six points and nearly double the online consumption since launching Gillette Shave Club. We're building partnerships with e-tailers and retailers who are offering their shoppers subscription tie-ins for the Gillette Shave Club which have enabled Gillette to deliver record online sales in each of the past three months.  In Hair Care, we launched our new conditioner innovation on Pantene in the US earlier this month. Pantene\u2019s new breakthrough conditioner technology delivers weightless conditioning, addressing the most significant consumer trial area for conditioners. The new conditioner innovation is a consumer blind test winner versus our best competitors in North America, China and Japan.  We recently launched two new Head & Shoulders variants in the US \u2013 Instant Fresh and Nourishing Care and are upgrading Head & Shoulders consumer message with a new campaign : Use daily to stay 100% flake free for life with Head & Shoulders scalp shield technology. Driven by these interventions in laundry, baby care, grooming, hair care and other categories, and by our investment in category-dedicated sales coverage, we are making sequential progress in our largest and most profitable market : the United States.  The US business rebounded from a 2-point organic sales decline in Q1 to deliver 3 points of organic growth in Q2. The US improvement was despite product allocation driven by demand in excess of supply in two of our largest categories : Baby Care and Feminine Care, and despite a record light cough cold season impacting the Vicks brand. Sales are probably a point or so ahead of consumption for the October-December quarter but the progress is encouraging nonetheless.  Our second largest market both sales and profits is China. Here Q2 organic sales were again down high single digits in line with the Q1 trend. We\u2019ve gotten behind in premium innovation which has been a contributor to our soft top line trends over the last several quarters. We're aggressively addressing this opportunity. David Taylor; Kathy Fish, our R&D leader, myself and several other members of our leadership team spent the last week in China. We\u2019re working with the team there and with the global business units to expand our offerings in the premium price tiers which are the fastest growing \u2013 to invest in trial consumer preferred products and to transform our go-to-market operations.  We\u2019ve launched premium Baby Care innovations in both the taped and pull-on segments. We\u2019re launching compact Ariel liquid detergents that consumers prefer over competition, and we have new upgrades coming soon on Tide. We've made meaningful product and packaging improvements in Hair Care that launched last quarter on both Head & Shoulders and Pantene. In Oral Care, we\u2019re launching Oral B Gum Care, a new super-premium gum repair line of Oral B toothpaste. The line includes a two-step paste and other single step paste variants. Consumer tests show the new line wining against top competition in the super premium tier. We\u2019re importing our best feminine care product Infinity to China with premium power toothbrushes and our best Braun razors. We\u2019re increasing our investment in consumer awareness, point of market entry sampling and trial across categories. We\u2019re strengthening our relationship and presence with key e-commerce and specialty retailers, the fastest-growing channels in the Chinese retail market.  We\u2019re investing in coverage of these channels and are working to simplify, standardize, and strengthen our overall go-to-market approach. These moves will take time to fully implement and the go-to-market changes may actually result in pullbacks before progress but we\u2019re confident they will result in stronger growth over time.  Stepping back then and looking at things on a macro level. The environment continues to be very challenging : slower market growth, steep foreign-exchange headwinds and a volatile political and policy environment. Against this backdrop, we continue to improve productivity to focus our portfolio and to invest in superior consumer preferred brands and products. We\u2019re putting particular priority against the four largest categories : Baby Care, Fabric Care, Hair Care and Grooming, and against our two largest markets : the US and China.  With that context as background, let me get into the details of the quarter we just completed as well as the outlook for the fiscal year. Two house-keeping items before I begin. First, the organic sales and core earnings results we\u2019re reporting today are based on our 10 core product categories. The results of the beauty and battery businesses that we\u2019re in the process of exiting are reported as discontinued operations. In late October, we provided the restated 10-K for fiscal 2015 presenting the historical results on the same basis.  Second, starting last quarter we\u2019re no longer consolidating the results of our Venezuelan subsidiaries in our reported numbers.  Organic sales were up 2% for the quarter versus the prior year. Each segment was at or ahead of year ago. As I mentioned previously, sales were slightly ahead of consumption. Organic sales in China and Russia were significantly lower versus last year, negatively impacting total company sales growth by more than a point. The category and SKU cleanup efforts drove up to another point of organic sales decline. These impacts were more than offset by progress in the United States and growth in Latin America. All-in sales were down 9%, including 8-point headwind from foreign-exchange and 3 points from the Venezuela de-consolidation and minor brand divestitures. Core gross margin and core operating margin each improved on both an all-in and ex-currency basis driven by productivity savings. Core gross margin increased 210 basis points versus the prior year. Excluding foreign exchange, core gross margin was up 290 basis points.  Core SG&A costs improved 140 basis points, driven primarily by overhead cost reductions. We continue to invest in marketing, reinvest in non-working cost savings. Marketing expenditures were in total equal to year ago as a percentage of sales. Core operating margin was up 350 basis points versus the prior year behind 270 basis points of productivity savings.  On a constant currency basis, our core operating margin was up 390 basis points. The core effective tax rate was 23.6%, up nearly a point versus last year. Core earnings per share were $1.04, up 9% versus the prior year quarter. This includes a 12 percentage point foreign-exchange headwind, approximately $300 million after-tax. On a constant currency basis, core earnings per share grew 21%. On an all-in GAAP basis, earnings-per-share were $1.12 for the quarter, up 37% versus the prior year.  We generated $3.8 billion in free cash flow, yielding 117% adjusted free cash flow productivity. We returned approximately $3.9 billion to shareholders this quarter through a combination of $1.9 billion in dividends and $2 billion in share repurchase.  Moving to guidance. We\u2019re maintaining our outlook for organic sales growth of in-line to up low-single digits versus fiscal 2015. We\u2019ve been investing to increase awareness and trial of our brands and products in North America, which is a key catalyst for growth in categories like Fabric Care and Baby Care. We\u2019re launching a number of new consumer preferred premium innovations over the next few months in both developed and developing markets. We\u2019re investing in selling capabilities to capitalize on opportunities in the fastest-growing channels and strengthen our presence in our most important markets.  We've also invested in targeted price reductions to narrow consumer value gaps in several categories. All of these efforts along with annualizing some of the most significant impacts from last fiscal year give us confidence we will continue to grow organic sales in the second half. The level of growth could be impacted by our access to dollars for finished product import into Venezuela. About 60% of our Venezuelan business is imported. The sale of imported products from the importing subsidiary is still reported in our consolidated results. Failure to continue this business would result in up to a half point impact to top-line growth in the fiscal year.  The headwind from foreign exchange has increased since the start of the year. We now expect FX will have a 7 percentage point impact on all-in sales growth. Also the combined impact of the Venezuela de-consolidation and minor brand divestitures will have a 2 to 3 percentage point drag on all-in sales growth. Taken together, we expect all-in sales to be down high single digits versus restated fiscal 2015 results.  We\u2019re also maintaining constant currency core earnings-per-share guidance of mid to high singles with our internal outlook currently at the low end of this range. Given the magnitude of the foreign-exchange impact, I thought it might be helpful to again recount how FX impacts our earnings. I will use the example of the Argentinian peso. We\u2019ve been most pleased to see the early decisive approach of Argentina\u2019s new leadership and believe the actions they are taking will create long-term benefits for which we are well-positioned to participate. But the nearly 30% to 40% devaluation of the peso will significantly impact our reported earnings in three ways. First, transaction impacts increase the cost of non-peso denominated inputs. We import, as an example, Gillette blades and razors from Mexico into Argentina. Widening of the cross-weight between the two peso currencies increases the Argentina unit cost of razors and reduces profit. Similarly, the local cost of plastic bottles which are denominated in dollars and imported into Argentina for the production of fabric care and hair care products have increased significantly. These transaction cost impacts affect all manufacturers, multinational or local whose materials or finished products are imported from similar sources and are similarly denominated. We attempt to recover these cost increases through pricing when local legal requirements and market realities allow it. Though there is a lag between the time when a currency devalues, the costs are incurred and the pricing is taken and executed through our channels of distribution.  The second impact is balance sheet revaluation. We need to revalue transaction-related payables and receivables balances at the end of each quarter. This includes the revaluation of balance as related to transactions between P&G legal entities that operate in different currencies. To continue the prior example, while razors produced in Mexico are being transported and are moving through the customs process into Argentina, our Argentinian business holds a Mexico peso-denominated payable on its books. At the end of every quarter, payables and receivables balances are revalued at current spot rates. Gains or losses from revaluing transactional balances flow through SG&A and are included in core earnings-per-share.  Third, income statements of foreign subsidiaries like Argentina that do not use US dollar as a functional currency are translated back to US dollars at the new exchange rate. Thus the Argentinian peso transaction, balance sheet revaluation and translation impacts have been and are projected to be significant, at about 70 :50 and $20 million after-tax respectively or a total of $140 million after tax for the year. Across all currencies, foreign exchange hurts total nearly $300 million after-tax in the December quarter, $700 million fiscal year to date and are forecast to be a $1 billion impact after-tax profit hurt over the course of the fiscal year.  When we talk about foreign-exchange impacts, we\u2019re sometimes asked, why we don't simply hedge these away. It\u2019s a very valid question and something we look at internally and with a different set of outside eyes every year as we prepare our financial plan.  There are three reasons we typically don't end up choosing to hedge. Up to two-thirds of our foreign-exchange losses and a significant amount of our forward exposure is in currencies that are either non-deliverable or are very difficult to hedge. The Argentinian peso, Venezuela bolivar and the Ukrainian hryvnia are three examples.  Second, hedging is neither free nor cheap. Currency volatility in itself increases in significant ways this cost. So when you want it most, it becomes difficult to afford. The last shortfall of hedging as the answer is that it solves nothing longer term. It also does nothing to help restore the margin structure of the business. A hedge simply defers volatility. When the instrument expires, you have the same hit with the same margin impact you would have had, had you not hedged. While it takes time and there is a lag between the hurt and the help, we typically look to pricing, sizing, mix enhancement, sourcing choices and cost reduction to manage FX impacts. We\u2019ve historically recovered about two-thirds of FX impacts with pricing over time. We think this time given differential impacts for euro and yen functional currency competitors, it will be somewhat less than that.  I said in our last call that we would invest where it was appropriate to do so. I said we would not cut smart investment to offset foreign-exchange impacts, which meant we could very well end up below the earnings-per-share guidance range. FX is a near-term reality that has gotten significantly worse. We\u2019re doing our best to offset FX impacts with productivity savings and pricing while continuing to make investments in brand equity, innovation, trial and value equations. We think we struck a reasonable balance of investment to improve the long term health of the business even though it requires we moderate our short-term earnings outlook, including foreign-exchange.  We\u2019re reducing our core earnings per share guidance to a range of down 3% to 8% versus last year\u2019s core earnings-per-share of $3.76. This earnings-per-share guidance includes headwinds of 8 to 9 percentage points from the combined impacts of beauty deal and transition expenses. These are for the businesses moving out to merge with Coty, Venezuela deconsolidation, lower operating income and a higher -- non-operating income, excuse me, and a higher tax rate. Adjusting for these items, our guidance translates to modest core earnings-per-share growth with meaningful growth excluding foreign exchange.  Our key assumptions on items below the core operating profit line have not changed. The core effective tax rate should be about 24% for fiscal 2016, about 3 points higher than last year, roughly a four percentage point headwind on core earnings per share growth. The core tax rate in the back half of fiscal year \u2013 last fiscal year was below 19%. We expect a tax rate of closer to 24% in the back half of this fiscal. We continue to expect non-operating income will be a 2 to 3 percentage point drag on core earnings per share growth mainly impacting the fourth quarter. We had nearly $440 million of non-operating income gains last year with over $400 million coming in the second half, including $355 million in the fourth quarter. We expect modest non-operating income gains in the back half of this fiscal.  With most of these impacts hitting in the back half, the core earnings per share growth headwind across Q3 and Q4 is roughly 13 percentage points or about $0.24 per share. FX adds another 7% or about $0.12 per share headwind in the back half. So while the midpoint of our new guidance range points to roughly a 15% core earnings-per-share reduction in the back half versus last year, or roughly flat excluding the tax and non-operating headwinds and up mid singles if we adjust for currency.  Given very strong progress to date, as I said before, 101% in Q1, and 117% in Q2, we\u2019re increasing our free cash flow productivity target from 90% to 100% of earnings. We continue to expect to retire shares at a value of approximately $8 billion to $9 billion through a combination of direct share repurchases and shares that will be exchanged during the third quarter in the Duracell transaction. In addition to the shares we expect to retire, we expect dividend payments of more than $7 billion and total $15 billion to $16 billion in dividend payments, share exchange and share repurchase.  We now expect all-in GAAP earnings-per-share to be up approximately 42% at the center of our guidance range. Going forward we are committed to balanced top-line and bottom line growth and strong free cash flow productivity to drive total shareholder return. We will continue to address value gaps if and when they emerge. We will defend our positions and we will invest behind brand trial, awareness programs and of course consumer preferred innovation. We will do everything we can from a productivity standpoint. We\u2019ll smartly invest to accelerate top-line growth and we will continue delivering on our commitment of strong cash return to shareholders. David and I both look forward to talking with you at CAGNY about the plan and priorities to deliver balanced growth and value creation beyond this fiscal year. I will provide an update on our productivity progress and the significant opportunity that remains in front of us which can help fuel investment and growth. David will discuss our strategic choices, how we plan to sustainably improve top-line growth and the organization and culture changes we will make to accelerate our progress.  That concludes our prepared remarks for this morning. As a reminder, business segment information is provided in our press release and will be available in slides which we posted on our website www.pg.com following the call. With that, I\u2019d be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian, Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : Good morning. I wanted to focus a bit more on the topline results. Q2 was a solid sequential improvement despite some of the retail inventory cuts you mentioned in the release. And your full year sales guidance on org sales, looks like it\u2019s moving up given the all-in guidance is unchanged despite the greater FX pressure. So what's driving that more favorable expectation? Are the factors behind it more longer-term in nature, temporary to this year? And then also, can you help explain \u2013 if we look at Nielsen Scanner data, we haven't seen improvement in the US, Europe, or emerging markets -- so if you could help explain the dichotomy between the improved expectations but the lack of scanner data sales improvement, that\u2019s be helpful. And then last, last quarter you mentioned second half organic sales growth would likely be above Q2. Is that still the case? Jon Moeller : So, first of all, Dara, we have maintained our organic sales growth guidance for the year, which is flat to low singles. So there\u2019s really no change in the overall outlook, which as you rightly say was for acceleration in Q2 and then further improvement in the back half of the year. As I mentioned, the extent of that improvement in the back half of the year is going to be potentially impacted by what happens with access to dollars for imports into Venezuela and it\u2019ll obviously be impacted by other things as well. But even with that we remain confident that we can continue to grow in the second half. In terms of the businesses in the US and the comparisons to scanner data, as you know we pretty dramatically accelerated our growth in the US from minus 2% in the quarter before to plus 3% this quarter. I mentioned that there was about a point of sales that\u2019s ahead of consumption. That\u2019s on things like the ProShield razor that we shipped into the market but still even adjusting for that acceleration as we expected. It\u2019s getting increasingly difficult to look only at scanner data as a measure of a market\u2019s health or a business\u2019 health. That's particularly true in markets like China where a huge portion of the growth of the market is coming in the e-commerce channel which doesn't cross a scanner. And you have some of that same dynamic in the US. So, for example, the Shave Club sales depending on how they\u2019re executed may or may not cross a scanner. And I think that's part of the dichotomy. But generally if we look across several quarters to dampen out some of the short-term volatility and the noise, we continue to be pleased and encouraged by increasing strength in North American business and we expect it to grow going forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson, Citi Research. Wendy Nicholson : Hi, first question just on housekeeping, I think you said China, your sales were down high single-digits. Do you have a sense for what the category growth was, just so we can compare that? and then second question, kind of more broadly on pricing, I guess, two components. Number one, in emerging markets where we continue to see currencies devalue like Russia, like Brazil, how far are you into your price increases, are you going to continue to take price increases to keep in line with inflation or sort of what\u2019s outlook there? And then second part of that, with regard to pricing in North America, it\u2019s surprising to me that there is still so much positive pricing kind of across the whole sector in light of the lower commodity prices. I don\u2019t know whether that\u2019s just the reflection of a stronger US consumer or more innovation but if you can comment kind of broadly on your outlook about pricing in North America and whether you think the price increases you\u2019ve taken are sustainable? Jon Moeller : Thanks, Wendy. Well first, China, it depends on the individual category but the market growth rates range roughly from, call it, 5% to 8%, so mid to high singles across the categories. And as I mentioned, we see significant opportunity remaining in China with those very effective growth rates albeit somewhat slower than they were two or three years ago. With the conversion from a manufacturing to a consumption-based economy, with the dramatic potential that exists as a result of larger family sizes from the possibility of two children versus just one and with the premiumization of the market which as I indicated admittedly we\u2019ve not been as agile as we need to be in exploiting. But really, as I mentioned I was there last week, I was there weeks before the Christmas holidays and I walked away with a tremendous sense of encouragement while acknowledging that we have work to do. In terms of pricing, the pricing dynamic should continue to be favorable contributor to topline growth as we move forward, even if all we do is take forward the price increases that have already been executed, they are not fully annualized yet. So that should continue to be a positive on the top line. The pricing calculus or algebra is fairly complicated. You really have to look at the combination of currencies, commodities and competition to determine a course of action going forward in any individual product category or market. And the sum of those three things is very different depending on what market you're in, as influenced by both currencies and by competition. In general the companies in our industry continue to price at some level for foreign-exchange. I mentioned in our prepared remarks that we expect our ability to price to be somewhat lower than it has been historically and we will make up for that over time with productivity and other savings.  And in the US, first of all, the commodity impacts aren\u2019t as significant as you would assume, just looking at the headlines on oil prices, for example. If you look at everything from diesel to resin to other inputs that are derived from the petro-complex, while the pricing benefit or cost reduction has occurred, it is not anywhere near the level yet of the crude price reductions. So I think that's a potential source of disconnect as people think about this. Generally we\u2019re taking pricing behind very strong product innovation. We\u2019re looking to improve the strength of our overall value equations, the combination of pricing, product, performance, consumer usage, experience, static [ph] and done in that way I think that continues to be a contributor to growth and value creation. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman, Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : I\u2019ve got a question on SG&A and reinvestment level. So we sort of keep track of the moving piece of your share each quarter and it looks like reinvestment in the business decelerated a bit in the second quarter. And then also to tie to your full year outlook, SG&A probably needs to go up in the back half. So can you just tell me if that\u2019s sort of on the right track and if it\u2019s going up, what the specific areas of reinvestment will be versus the pace of the overhead take-out? Jon Moeller : So we expect, for example, our media spending to be up double-digits in the second half versus year ago. So as reinvestment as compared to the prior year that will definitely be increasing. As we look at those choices, we\u2019re obviously not encumbered by the math. We\u2019re looking at the value creation potential that exists behind those investments in both the short and importantly mid and longer-term and we will invest where we have opportunities to do so. So I think that, you should think of the level of investment, reinvestment sequentially increasing as we go forward. I think, I know that will be the case this fiscal year. I expect that will be the case next fiscal year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Faucher, JPMorgan. John Faucher : Thanks. Just to follow up on that. Jon, it seems as though you\u2019ve delivered upside on the sort of FX neutral earnings growth year-to-date, particularly today you\u2019re going to the low end of the range. Is that because of some of the incremental investments you are talking about? Is that ad spend sort of incremental to what you were thinking before? And then separately -- and thanks for the color on the FX piece \u2013 it\u2019s a pretty wide range if we look at that over the balance of the year in terms of the FX impact, it\u2019s probably something in the neighborhood of like $0.20. And so I guess I'm just wondering what drives those differences in outcomes from an FX standpoint because, just so we understand where we need to go within that range? Jon Moeller : In terms of over-delivering and then maintaining the constant currency guidance, yes that definitely is reflective of additional investment, I mentioned in our prepared remarks that in North America, for example, we\u2019ve increased our budgets by about 100 basis points since the start of the year, most of that occurring relatively recently, that\u2019s driven both by our encouragement from a response standpoint to the spending that we have in the market and the acceleration of growth particularly in the US. And so yes, your interpretation is correct in terms of the various moving pieces. The guidance range is really reflective of what the underlying constant currency range of outcomes could be and then we just apply the current FX math on top of that. And there\u2019s a lot of \u2013 we\u2019re operating in a more volatile environment than we ever have, and I think our range is reflective of that reality as it should be. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo. Chris Ferrara : Hey thanks, Jon, make you rehash this a little bit but I guess I'm not -- I'm not totally understanding why the back half EBIT would decline. So I think I understand the below the line impact of tax rate and other. But it looks like FX probably gets less of that in the back half of the year. So I think you said that, right, yet your guidance range really implies a deceleration in EBIT. So and a reasonably substantial one from this past quarter. So I guess, correct me if that's wrong but do you guys expect the gross margin acceleration to slow in the back half of the year, maybe I guess what might I be missing? Jon Moeller : Some of those impacts -- that 8 to 9 point impact of things like Venezuela deconsolidation and the beauty transition costs and the non-operating income difference are all in the EBIT line. So that\u2019s a significant driver of lower EBIT comparisons second half versus first half. As I mentioned, most of those hit the second half disproportionately. In terms of currency, there is some let up but not a lot in the back half. And I expect our margin progress to continue to be reasonably strong, certainly constant currency on both gross and operating. So really the comparison is most dramatically driven by FX and by things like the Venezuela deconsolidation, the transition costs associated with the beauty business that are not in discontinued operations. For example, if we have employees in our global business service organization that are working to stand up the new company in terms of building the systems that are required etc. those are employees that are going to remain with Procter & Gamble and therefore their costs are not in discontinued operations, they are in continuing operations. And then as I mentioned, the divestiture gain in non-op is a big driver as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank. Bill Schmitz : A couple of questions, just a housekeeping one. Do you still think Duracell is going to close roughly in any day now and is Coty still set to close July, August? And then my real question is, when do you guys \u2013 when does market share really start to matter, because I know you\u2019ve kind of sort of downplayed it and said, we\u2019re about expanding categories and protecting the structural integrity of our categories but it just seems that some of the share decline, as some others mentioned, especially some of the emerging markets are a pretty significant. So can you just tell me like, if you\u2019re going to have a point in time where the focus is going to shift, and you\u2019re going to start focusing on market share again and then just in a quarter what percentage of the business is gaining market share? Jon Moeller : Duracell, as I mentioned earlier should close this quarter. The exact date will depend on work that still needs to occur but that's on track. Coty is currently scheduled to close as well on the timing that we initially indicated, which should be in the back half of the calendar year, so no changes on either of those, both progressing towards the desired end points that we would hope.  In terms of market share, our objective is balanced growth and value creation with the growth objective being over time at to slightly ahead of markets. So market share does matter but particularly in a time when we need to restore structural economics and in response to currency moves we can get ourselves in big trouble, as that becomes the driving metric. And so as we\u2019ve said we\u2019re prepared to lose some share in two situations. One is where we\u2019re restoring our structural economic attractiveness and having a higher market share with a negative gross margin isn\u2019t helpful to anyone. And also where we are doing some of portfolio cleanup that I mentioned on the core categories but we will be in a much better position longer term from both the growth and value creation standpoint if we can focus on the parts of our portfolio that are really working for us. So if you look at the percentage of business that is holding our growing share, it\u2019s about 45% globally currently, we would expect that to be higher going forward. In the US where we are further ahead in the strengthening of our portfolio et cetera, we\u2019ve got about 60% of business holding in our growing share. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan, Stifel Nicolaus. Mark Astrachan : Good morning, everybody. I wanted to go back to China, Jon. So, does the sales growth guidance for the back half of the year anticipate an improvement in current trends? And then related to that, given the time that you talked about being in the market, do you think it's realistic you can be competitive in all the categories in which you compete today? Jon Moeller : The current guidance does an improvement in China in the back half and that should be very doable just based on the math alone. In other words, the annualization of some of the changes that we made in our go to market and inventory levels in the back half of last year. So we do expect that will improve and again as I said our view on China is an opportunistic one, not a pessimistic one. We really think that there is significant continued opportunity there both top and bottom line. And I think we picked the categories that we\u2019re going to compete in, in the new portfolio based on our view of our capability to be more than competitive to win. These are categories that we have won in, we\u2019re global leaders in almost every single one, I think seven out of 10, and we are among the leaders in the balance. There is a margin structure that allows for a significant investment and growth in each of these businesses. These are higher margin businesses and they are businesses that importantly leverage our core capabilities as a company. So they have been deliberately chosen for success. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with UBS. Steve Powers : Thanks, Jon. So, I guess on the one hand, I think we're all very pleased with the return to positive organic growth, especially alongside the strong cash productivity and margin progression that you called out. And then on the other hand, volumes were still down 2%. I guess 1%, if I exclude the businesses you've chosen to exit. But negative essentially across the whole business nonetheless. And market share, sounds like it was down in aggregate. So I guess just some further comments there would be helpful in terms of how and when you're likely to come out of this negative volume phase? Because if I go back over the last 15 years or so, we're sort of in this anomalous period where last year and sounds like this year we're in negative volume territory. The only time that's ever happened was the financial crisis. So I guess again, how and when can we sort of inflect positive on that key volume number? Jon Moeller : So the two drivers of the volume reduction, one, as you indicated there is a portfolio cleanup within the core categories that are still reported within continuing operations and as you rightly indicated, that\u2019s had about a point worth of impact. And the other is the market reaction from a consumption standpoint and in some cases the share price evolution, as we take pricing to offset foreign exchange impacts in large devaluation markets. So if you take Russia, or the Ukraine as an example, where devaluation has been 70%, 80%, 110%, we have negative gross margins, we need to price over time as well as do everything we can from a savings standpoint to restore those margins at least to a positive levels, so the growth is meaningful. And during that process, both at a market level, the markets tend to contract in response to higher price points and sometimes from a share standpoint and Russia and Ukraine are good examples where we\u2019re competing against strong European competitors, in other case, Russia, Japanese competitors as well, and sometimes there's a modest share impact that comes with the pricing that we deem necessary to take. We are not prepared to lose share indefinitely. Our history in this area is that it takes kind of six to nine months to work our way through this. Some of the pricing that we\u2019ve taken has been recent because a lot of the devaluation has been recent. So I don't -- I haven't actually looked at it quarter by quarter to see what\u2019s the quarter where volume will re-inflect positive. We\u2019ll have to work our way through this pricing. I don't believe -- go back to the comments on market share, we fully intend to grow at market growth rates or slightly ahead of market growth rates over longer periods of time, that requires volume growth. I mentioned market is growing 3 percent-nish, we\u2019re not going to be able to take 3% pricing indefinitely, nor is that our intent in any way. So we will -- also we\u2019re not in markets where competitors don\u2019t respond from a pricing standpoint. Remember we \u2013 because we are the market leaders typically have to lead or nothing happens, so we\u2019re exposed for that period of time and competitors can take six to nine months sometimes before they respond or they cannot respond at all. And to cases where they don\u2019t respond to the level that are necessarily to maintain are value equation comparisons or where they don\u2019t price at all, we will reduce price. We\u2019re not going to be un-competitive, we\u2019re not going to lose share on a sustained basis. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Nik Modi : Just two quick questions. Jon, can you maybe provide just a quick bridge on the volume? When you talk about the US going positive and helping us reconcile how you got to the total consolidated number, just so we get a geographic viewpoint. And then the bigger question is, as you kind of push responsibility closer to those 10 business leaders, how long does that take to really start affecting business decisions and on the ground results? I'm trying to get a sense of what the time lag typically you would expect after making a move like that. Jon Moeller : Thanks for the bigger picture question, Nik. It\u2019s actually something we will spend some time talking about at CAGNY. It\u2019s interesting, the market on a relative inflection point standpoint, that\u2019s growing the strongest which is the US, is one where these changes were made first. They were made about year ago, where basically in addition to the 10 categories and their ability to operate somewhat independently, we\u2019ve sectorized our sales force and so we\u2019re going end to end from GBU all the way through to customer with dedicated sales support. We\u2019re not moving people as rapidly across categories. The GBUs have full decision rights on the amount of resources that are supporting their business from a go to market operation standpoint, which has led to some choices quite frankly to increase coverage in some channels, it\u2019s led to choices to hire mid-career talent that has experience in a category that extends beyond the experience of our current employees. So it\u2019s having a dramatic impact and every change has a slightly different timeline in terms of when it could reflect in the business results. But I think we can \u2013 I think we\u2019re making good progress in this area. I think we have more to do. Again we will talk about that at CAGNY, and I don't think it takes a long period of time to make a difference. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Javier Escalante, Consumer Edge Research. Javier Escalante : Hi, good morning everyone. Going back to Nik's questions, which I don't think -- at least I didn't hear the response, is that could you break out geographically the growth at, say, in emerging markets between -- also between volume and pricing? Secondly, it is true that volume has been negative for four quarters in a row. To what extent you feel that this has been problems in the way you execute pricing as it happened in Russia and Mexico and whether those execution issues have been resolved? My understanding is that you have removed some of the heads of China and Latin America. All these changes are over. Shall we expect pricing to be less disruptive going forward? Jon Moeller : First, sorry, I did miss the first part of Nik\u2019s question, thanks for bringing that back. The relationship of organic volume to organic sales in the October-December quarter, developed markets organic volume was plus 2, organic sales were plus 3. If you look at developing, organic volume was minus 6, organic sales were flat versus year ago. If you look at those comparisons, they are indicative of exactly what I have said a couple times in this call in terms of what\u2019s driving the volume reduction is pricing in developing markets to offset FX where you don't have as much of an FX impact. For instance in the developed markets our volumes grew at 2% in the quarter. In terms of \u2013 you mentioned Mexico as an example, we actually had a very good quarter in Mexico. The changes that we\u2019ve made there, we\u2019re very pleased with. Organic sales were up 4% in Mexico in the quarter and remember I talked about the tissue towel impact \u2013 the tissue change in the portfolio which has negatively impacted organic sales, that\u2019s in Mexico. Excluding that, Mexico organic sales were up 8% in the quarter and volume was up as well. So again there is a bit of noise as we work through the combination of the portfolio and foreign-exchange. But we expect volume will grow as we go forward and share will also be something that becomes increasingly attainable. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello with Raymond James. Joe Altobello : First question is on Brazil. I apologize if I missed this, but what were the Brazilian sales in the quarter? I think last quarter was down 12%. You were hoping for a little bit of bounce back this quarter. Secondly, on commodities, Jon, you mentioned earlier that you're not seeing the benefit that some would think you would given the move in oil but obviously it is a positive for you this year. So what kind of boost do you see from commodities to earnings this fiscal year? Jon Moeller : Thanks Joe. Brazil, for the quarter organic sales were up 11%, that compares to minus 12% the prior quarter, I think that again is another good example of the volatility that\u2019s going to occur here as we get the right pricing set in the market and as well our ability to pull that through and generate growth on a sustainable basis. So again Brazil was up 11% on the quarter. In terms of commodities, look that as a single area, so the reduction of input costs, that impact is about $500 million on the fiscal year. Some of that we anticipated going into the year for us but that\u2019s the amount. I would argue that in total, in other words, inclusive of consumption impacts in oil producing countries where there has been massive disruption and instability, if you think about markets like Saudi Arabia, markets like certainly Venezuela, I would say that the net impact in our P&L is likely neutral negative but the pure cost impact is $500 million. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Bill Chappell : Jon, I just wanted to follow-up, since you had highlighted kind of the changes made both in Mexico and India and the not worse gaining sales, if they're not worth anything. I think you said that costs about 1 point to organic growth in the quarter. If that's right, is that the expected impact for the next two, three quarters and is this kind of a program that may accelerate as we move into fiscal \u201817? Jon Moeller : The amount is the correct amount, you are right, it was about a point in the quarter. We would expect \u2013 we really started this work in terms of execution in July-September, maybe some in the latter part of last fiscal year, so we would expect this to continue through the next couple quarters but then it should dissipate going forward. There may be a few additional choices we need to make but in general you will see it for the next couple of quarters and then it should start to dissipate. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj from Bernstein. Ali Dibadj : Hey, guys, thanks for fitting me into the call. Believe it or not, I still have a few questions. One is just go deeper on volumes. Look, your compares clearly get easier over the next couple quarters, so that should certainly bode well. But can you elaborate a little bit more and perhaps even quantify the inventory management change by retailers and the trade term change that you mentioned in the press release, which is mentioned as a negative. Particularly in the context of what you said on your prepared remarks, which is that sales being slightly ahead of consumption. So give us a sense of the ongoing effects of those if you could? Number one.  Number two is on your FX kind of multiplier between the top-line and the bottom-line impact, why did it change so dramatically versus your \u201816 guidance? So what I mean is that in July, your FX impact was going to be negative 4% to 5% top line, negative 3% to 4% bottom line, so kind of a less than 1 ratio. But now it's a negative 7% on top line, negative 10% on the bottom line, so very quickly shifting to a greater than 1 ratio, despite your efforts to localize more, et cetera. So is that all Argentina devaluation? Or is there some forecasting math that I'm not getting or can you give us a sense of how your business is structured or levered differently than we would expect it, because it's big switch in a short period of time? And then third question is more in terms of running these conference calls. Should we infer that the decision was made, because I know you guys were thinking about this, that your CEO will not be on these quarterly calls and will only be at things like CAGNY and the annual calls like AG was doing? Or are you still in the deciding mode? Thanks for the two questions. Jon Moeller : On the FX multiplier, as you can imagine the different currencies that have \u2013 we have no ability to forecast which currencies are going to move and how much they are going to move. And top and bottom line relationship between currency movements is very different depending on the market. It depends on how the markets source, it depends on the balance sheet of the market, I mentioned balance sheet revaluations, so for example, in Argentina we\u2019ve talked about the balance sheet revaluation that occurred there, so it\u2019s really a function of what actually is happening in the marketplace country by country, how we source to markets and what the balance sheet exposure is in different markets. So I guess I am saying we don't really have a good ability to forecast exactly what the currency impact is going to be on either the top or bottom line and frankly we spend very little time thinking about the relationship between the two.  In terms of the comments on trade inventory reduction, that is largely a China dynamic. I mentioned in prior calls that our inventory levels were too high particularly in the wholesale channel in China, and as a result our pricing was too low which was driving a bit of a distortion and difficulty for our distributors. And so we\u2019ve made some choices to address that and that has a short-term volume impact. That\u2019s really what that comment was designed to indicate.  Relative to senior executive engagement with the investment community, we intend to be fully engaged with the investment community through a combination of quarterly conference calls, investment conferences, meetings here in Cincinnati. Dave will be on the road frequently as well interacting with the investment community. So again our strategy is one of very high engagement.  End of Q& A Operator : Ladies and gentlemen that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

Operator : Good morning and welcome to Procter & Gamble's quarter end conference call. P&G would like to remind you that today's discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections. Also, as required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with valuable information on the underlying growth trends of the business, and has posted on its website, www.PG.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP and other financial measures. Now I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller. Jon Moeller : Thanks and good morning. As David Taylor said on the press release we issued earlier this morning, we continue to make progress on the transformation we are making to return P&G's results to a balance of strong top line growth, bottom line growth, and cash generation. We achieved a significant milestone this quarter in the transformation of the product portfolio with the exit of batteries business. We delivered another strong quarter of productivity improvement and cost savings. And we increased investments in innovation, advertising, and selling capacity to enhance our long-term prospects for faster, sustainable top line growth and value creation. We do continue to operate in a challenging and volatile macro environment. Market growth rates on both a volume and value basis have decelerated, due mainly to slower growth in developing markets. We entered the year expecting the market to grow close to 3% to 4% globally. We now expect 3%. There are more flashpoints across the globe than at any time in recent memory, with significant economic and political instability impacting incomes and consumption in many large and important markets : Russia, the Ukraine, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the balance of the Middle East, Turkey, Nigeria, Argentina, Venezuela, Brazil. We generate more than 10% of our annual sales and profit in these markets. Currencies have weakened across the board since the start of our fiscal year. While the dollar has softened a bit recently, we still face up to $1 billion after-tax net earnings impact versus year ago, a $200 million increase since just the start of December. Across four years, FX has reduced net earnings by about $4 billion after tax, nearly 40% of fiscal year 2012 net earnings. Against this backdrop, we remain focused on large opportunities in our control, executing what is the largest transformation in our company's history, step-changing cost and cash productivity, transforming our portfolio, strengthening our organization and culture, and reaccelerating top line growth with strength in category business models and innovation plans and, where appropriate, improved value equations. This transformation is aimed at delivering balanced top and bottom line growth and leadership value creation. I'm going to talk briefly about each of those transformation steps, productivity, portfolio, organization, and top line reacceleration, before getting in to the details of the quarter. We continue to dramatically improve cost and cash productivity, with significant upside still ahead. Our original five-year cost of goods savings target was $6 billion. We expect to deliver over $7 billion by the end of this year, $1 billion or more above our initial target. We've reduced manufacturing enrollment by 15% over the last three years. This includes new staffing necessary to support capacity additions. On a same-site basis, manufacturing enrollment is down 20%. We're targeting a 25% to 30% cumulative reduction by the end of fiscal 2017. In February 2012, we announced that we would reduce non-manufacturing overhead by 10% over five years. As of March 31, we've reduced these roles by more than 24%, almost 2.5 times the original target. We expect to meet our latest target of 25% to 30% by the end of this year, one year ahead of schedule. Including divestitures, we'll reduce non-manufacturing roles by about 35% by the end of fiscal 2017. We're reducing non-working marketing expenditures, costs that do not impact reach, frequency, or continuity of our advertising and trial generation programs. We were spending $2 billion per year on agency fees. Last year we reduced the roughly 6,000 agencies we work with by nearly 40% and cut agency and production spending by about $370 million. We're aiming for an additional $200 million of agency-related savings this year, reinvesting those savings in advertising and sampling of consumer-preferred products. Net of reinvestments in innovations, selling, media, and sampling, productivity has enabled us to deliver constant currency gross and operating profit margin improvement in each of the last three fiscal years, driving double-digit constant currency core earnings per share growth in each of those years. We're on track to improve gross and operating margins by triple-digit indices, both including and excluding currency impacts, again this fiscal year. We're driving productivity up and down the income statement and across the balance sheet. Inventory days are down. Payable days are up. Balance sheet productivity has enabled us to extend our long track record of very strong adjusted free cash flow productivity, 102% last fiscal year, 101% in Q1, 117% in Q2, and 105% in the quarter we just completed, even as we spend capital to transform our supply chain. We continue to maintain our position as one of the strongest cash generators among competitive peers and comparable mega-cap companies. We're among the top companies in returning cash to shareholders. Over the past decade we have returned more than $118 billion in cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchase. We said four years ago that we needed to make cost and cash productivity part of our culture, as integral to our culture as innovation. We've made significant progress and we have significant opportunity. Our strong track record and our line of sight to additional opportunity both inform our intent to save as much as another $10 billion in cost over the next five years. Our supply chain transformation is in its early stages, first in North America and Europe, then in Latin America and in India, Middle East, and Africa. We're in an investment mode now, with savings to start in three to four years. Our new U.S. mixing centers are up and running, putting roughly 80% of volume within 24 hours of store shelves. We're constructing multi-category manufacturing sites in geographically strategic locations to replace smaller single-category sites in less cost-effective locations. We're upgrading and standardizing manufacturing platforms to lower cost and facilitate faster innovation. We're employing smart automation and digitization to improve manufacturing productivity, raw material and finished product logistics, and demand planning. We have additional opportunity to optimize working capital and further increase the efficiency of our capital spend. After two strong years of savings, we'll enter next year still spending $1.5 billion in agency-related marketing costs, still more room to improve. We'll continue to look for efficiencies in working media with better advertising targeting and earned media campaigns with engaging content. As we fully operationalize the new focused 10-category company, there will undoubtedly be additional opportunities to increase organization efficiency, agility, and speed of decision-making. Digitization will continue to enable smart productivity choices. Finally, we'll be working to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of our promotion spending. We currently spend about $18 billion in deductions between gross and net sales. We see clear opportunities to improve the effectiveness of this spend for both us and our retail partners and to improve its efficiency. So we're targeting up to $10 billion of additional savings over the next five years. We expect to reinvest a significant amount of the savings in R&D and product and packaging improvements, sales capacity, and in brand awareness and trial building programs to deliver balanced top and bottom line growth and to create value for shareowners. In addition to transforming our cost structure, we're transforming our portfolio. Over the past 18 months, we've divested, discontinued, or consolidated 55 brands, including the completion of the Duracell transaction at the end of February. We have 50 more brands in the exit process, including the 41 Beauty brands in the transaction with Coty. The S-4 registration statement for the Beauty transaction was filed last week. We're on track to close the deal in the second half of the calendar year. In total we'll exit 105 brands and all the complexity they create. These brands represent only about 6% of fiscal 2013 profit. Going forward, we're anchoring our portfolio on 10 category-based business units and about 65 brands. These are categories where P&G has leading market positions and where product technologies deliver performance differences that matter to consumers. These 10 businesses have historically grown faster with higher margins than the balance of the company. Within these core businesses, we're focusing our offerings, making smart choices for short, mid, and long-term value creation, forgoing bad businesses even when these choices create near-term top line pressure. In Mexico, for example, we made the choice to discontinue low-tier, unprofitable, and commoditizing toilet paper products in favor of very profitable high-tier differentiated products. Sales are down 75%, but before-tax margins have improved by more than 50 basis points, from very negative to nicely positive. It will take a few more quarters for the top line drag to dissipate, and we'll have a solidly value-accretive business going forward. In India, we've made a choice to deprioritize several unprofitable lines of business which negatively impact short-term top line growth rates, but will lead longer term to a much more profitable business that will grow strongly. The strategic portion of our India business is growing at a high single-digit pace. Sales in the portion we're fixing or exiting have been down more than 30%. This top line pain is worth it. We're making significant progress in improving local profit margins, up about 700 basis points. We've gone from losing significant money in India to triple-digit profits in just two years. We're taking a similar approach in our Fabric Care product portfolio, discontinuing product forms, additives, bars, bleaches and tablets, and value-tier detergents that have been a drag on profitability and value creation. These choices are causing a top line drag of nearly a point on the global Fabric Care business, but profitability and the long-term attractiveness of the business improves. Combined, these choices are causing about a one-point drag on organic sales growth. We expect this headwind to continue for the balance of the calendar year and then dissipate as we annualize more of the impacts. As we come out of this, we'll have stronger top line growth that is worth something on the bottom line. We're transforming our organization and culture. We're making many changes that by themselves may seem small and obvious, but together are significant and important. As an example, we've made several important changes in how we go to market. We eliminated overlapping resources and duplicative structures and responsibilities of marketing and sales professionals in the global business units and market development organizations, clarifying responsibilities and strengthening accountability. Reflecting this, we changed the name of the market development organizations to Selling and Market Operations, small but very important. We're increasingly staffing leadership roles in the selling and marketing operations with leaders who have significant selling experience. We're changing our talent development and assignment planning to drive more mastery and depth. The objective is simple, improve business results by getting and keeping the right people in the right places to develop and apply deep category mastery to winning. Consistent with this, we're dedicating sales resources to categories or sectors. In our larger markets, sales resources have greater accountability back to the categories they serve, which is a change. We're aligning incentives at a lower and more specific level of granularity to better match these responsibilities and to increase accountability. Another example of the evolution of our thinking on the organization is what David talked about at CAGNY. He said that P&G is fortunate to consistently source and develop strong talent and that we intend to maintain our develop-from-within approach. But there are times when the best talent for a role may not be inside our organization. Going forward, we're going to look at outside hiring more often when we need it to field the best team possible. The bottom line is that we're committed to getting, keeping, and growing the right talent in the right place to better drive business results. Again, each of these changes may seem small and rather obvious, but collectively they are big and important changes for our organization and culture. A very important area of transformation is the reacceleration of top line growth. We expect to make progress in all 10 product categories, but we're putting specific emphasis against the four largest categories, Baby Care, Fabric Care, Hair Care, and Grooming; and the two largest markets, the U.S. and China. These four categories represent over 60% of sales and profit. These two countries represent nearly 50% of sales and more than 50% of profit. We're growing our Fabric Care business with consumer-preferred brands and product offerings like our premium performance and premium priced unit-dosed detergents and our market-leading and market-expanding scent bead fabric enhancers. We're exiting slower growing, lower-priced, more commoditized product forms where it's more difficult to distinguish our products and create value. Fabric Care results in the U.S. demonstrates what's possible when we deliver superior value with best-in-class performance at a modest price premium. The U.S. laundry detergent market is continuing to grow behind these efforts, with the category up more than four points on a value basis over the last three, six, and nine-month periods. The same is true for fabric enhancers. Spurred by the rapid growth of scent beads, the U.S. fabric enhancers category is growing, up more than six points on a value basis over the last three, six, and nine-month periods. Our share is growing. P&G's U.S. laundry detergent and fabric enhancer value shares were each up nearly a point in the March quarter. We will continue to be the innovation leader in Fabric Care. In North America, we're introducing a new regimen on Tide and Downy that addresses the odor problems common to athletic wear. Seventy percent of consumers wear athletic gear multiple times each week. The Odor Defense collection, anchored by innovation on Tide Pods, brings a proprietary formula of enzymes and surfactants that break down and remove stubborn soils and residues for a great clean and fresh scent. Paired with the added cleaning power of Tide Odor Defense Rescue laundry booster and Downy Fresh Protect Odor Defense beats, this regimen promises to eliminate odors from the fast-growing market of athleisure clothes people are wearing far beyond the gym. Next month we start our learning market on Tide Pure Clean liquid detergent in the U.S. Naturals is a large and growing segment in several categories, but naturals are only about 3% of the laundry category. Unlocking growth in naturals is about solving the tension between green and clean. People want performance and sustainability. Pure Clean provides the cleaning power of Tide with 65% bio-based ingredients, and it's produced with 100% renewable wind power electricity in a facility operating with zero manufacturing waste to landfill. We're launching better performing and more profitable new compact liquid detergents in Russia, Turkey, Mexico, Brazil, and China. In Russia and Turkey, where we launched superior compact liquid detergents early last calendar year, P&G's share of liquid detergents are up seven points and 14 points respectively. We've increased sampling in new washing machines, a key point of category entry and change for consumers. Last fiscal year, we distributed 5 million samples in washing machines globally. This fiscal year, we'll distribute about 17 million. In calendar year 2016, we'll distribute 30 million samples of our best performing products. In U.S. Baby Care, strong innovation, consumer communication, trial programs, and a robust online presence have led to strong growth for Pampers. Pampers value share of U.S. diapers was up more than 1.5 points last fiscal year and was up a point in the March quarter. Pampers' latest Swaddlers and Cruisers innovation, Extra Absorb Channels, was off to a good start in the new calendar year, with Swaddlers and Cruisers share up more than a point in the last quarter. We strengthened investments in brand awareness and trial at the point of market entry. Seventy percent of new moms in the U.S. will receive samples of our best products through our prenatal baby shower and hospital programs. Last fiscal year marked the seventh consecutive year of sales and value share growth for the Luvs brand in the U.S. However, results have been down so far this year following a significant price reduction taken by our primary competitor. We're taking steps to improve the awareness, trial, and consumer value of Luvs. We increasing equity-building advertising, strengthening in-store programs, and have product and packaging improvements slated for launch next quarter. Baby Care results have been softer in other markets. To address this, we've strengthened our value proposition in several markets and accelerated premium innovation on both taped and pull-on diapers to restore competitiveness at the top end of the market. We're strengthening our selling resources and programs for baby stores, and we're improving our point of market entry programs to deliver higher awareness and trial of Pampers among new moms. In Hair Care, we launched our new conditioner innovation on Pantene in the U.S. last quarter. Pantene's new breakthrough conditioner technology delivers Weightless Conditioning, addressing the most significant consumer trial barrier in the category. The new conditioner innovation is a consumer blind test winner versus our best competition in North America, China, and Japan. We continue to strongly support Head & Shoulders, one of our steadiest and strongest growing brands, delivering over 8% compound average sales growth over the past 10 years, even with significant currency impacts. Organic sales for Pantene and Head & Shoulders were each up high single digits in the U.S. in the March quarter. Gillette has delivered steady growth in international markets so far this fiscal year behind strong innovation, advertising, and sampling programs. Gillette is holding or growing value share in each region outside the U.S. The growth in international markets has been offset by soft results in the U.S. To improve our growth and the growth of the market, we're investing in innovation, new user trial, and improved consumer value. We're expanding our performance advantage at the top end of the market. Our most recent cartridge innovation, Gillette Fusion ProShield, launched last quarter. ProShield with lubrication before and after the blades shields against irritation during every shave. Early consumption results in the U.S. have been tracking ahead of plan. We're supporting a broader range of our product ladder, from our best product, Fusion FlexBall ProShield to MACH3 to premium priced and superior performance disposables, with stronger consumer value communication. We're facing more aggressive competition at lower price points, and we will respond to ensure our brands remain a superior consumer value. We've stepped up new trial activities in the U.S. with our 18th birthday sampling program. We have put Fusion ProGlide FlexBall razors in the hands of nearly 80% of young men, over 2 million samples last year, a 33% increase over the prior year level. We've now begun sampling the FlexBall razor handle and the ProShield cartridge, our very best combination of shaving technologies. We're not standing still in the other categories. We've delivered solid organic sales growth in the U.S. this quarter in the Feminine Care, Family Care, and Home Care categories, all big and profitable businesses for us. P&G continues to be the innovation leader in our U.S. categories. In the IRI Innovation Pacesetters report just published, P&G had four of the top 10 innovations and six of the top 13. Top innovations recognized for 2015 sales were Tide Simply Clean & Fresh, Always Discreet, Fusion ProGlide FlexBall, Venus Swirl, Febreze Unstoppables, and Tide Plus Ultra Stain Release. Overall in the U.S., organic sales were up 2%, in line with underlying market growth of our categories. Organic volume was up 3% for the quarter. We're making progress in China, but there's still more work to do. We narrowed sales declines by half this quarter and expect to improve again next quarter. We recently upgraded our Pampers premium diaper pants to improve fit and softness, and we have new innovations coming soon on mid-tier pants and premium taped diapers. Oral-B Super Premium toothpaste launched in over 700 stores last quarter, reaching roughly a 5% share in those outlets. We'll triple distribution on this item this quarter. Ariel is growing in China following the concentrated liquid detergent launch in January. Gillette Fusion FlexBall has driven male razor system share growth over the past three, six, and 12-month periods. And SK-II continues to deliver very strong growth, with sales for the quarter up nearly 20%. So some bright spots are emerging, but it will take time to get fully back to target growth rates. We are realistic that improvements in top line growth won't happen overnight and they won't happen in a straight line, but they will continue to improve over time. Let me move now to the quarter we just completed and to the outlook for the fiscal year. Organic sales were up 1% for the quarter versus the prior year. The impact from the portfolio cleanup efforts I discussed earlier was about a one-point drag on organic sales growth. All-in sales were down 7%, including a five-point headwind from foreign exchange, three points from the combination of Venezuela deconsolidation and minor brand divestitures. Core earnings per share were $0.86, down 3% versus the prior year. Core gross margin increased 270 basis points. Core operating margin increased 300 basis points. This quarter's core earnings per share results included a net FX headwind of approximately $90 million after tax or $0.03 per share, comprised of a negative spot rate impact of about $230 million, which was partially offset by a $140 million balance sheet revaluation impact in the base period that did not recur this year. Venezuela continues to be a difficult market and was also a drag on March quarter results. At the beginning of the fiscal year, we announced our decision to deconsolidate our Venezuelan operations, no longer reporting sales or profits from products locally manufactured and sold in Venezuela. We continue to recognize sales and profit on products sold to our Venezuelan subsidiaries from non-Venezuelan P&G entities. We highlighted at CAGNY that a disruption in our Venezuelan subsidiary's ability to access dollars to pay for these imports of finished products could have a negative impact on our top and bottom line results. We've been unable to access U.S. dollars in any size since November, and as a result reported no sales or profit for Venezuela in the March quarter. This caused a 20 basis point organic sales growth reduction in the quarter. On the bottom line, the total impact of Venezuela was $0.05 per share or 6% in terms of core EPS. Assuming these financing constraints continue, the bottom line impact on the year will be up to $0.10 per share or minus 3%. The core effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.2%, up 800 basis points versus last year, a $0.10 per share impact on core earnings per share and 11 percentage point impact on core earnings per share growth. The base period tax rate was unusually low due to the geographic mix of earnings and due to audit settlements, and the current period rate was inflated by a valuation allowance against net operating loss carry-forwards. These two items account for about six points of the eight-point change in the tax rate. These three impacts, FX, Venezuela, and tax, were a combined core earnings per share growth headwind of 20% this quarter. On an all-in GAAP basis, earnings per share were $0.97 for the quarter, up 29% versus the prior year. We generated $2.5 billion in free cash flow, yielding 105% adjusted free cash flow productivity. We returned approximately $2.9 billion to shareholders this quarter through a combination of $1.9 billion in dividends and $1 billion in share repurchase. In addition, we received approximately $4.2 billion of stock through the Duracell transaction. Earlier this month, we increased the dividend 1%, making this the 60th consecutive year the company has increased the dividend. The size of the dividend increase reflects FX headwinds, the cash impacts from streamlining and strengthening the business unit portfolio, and our plans to increase investments in the business to accelerate top line growth. Moving to guidance, our outlook for the fiscal year reflects four large factors driving lower earnings in the fourth quarter. First, lower non-operating income; we expect about $100 million less in the fourth quarter this year versus last year. Second, tax; the Q4 tax rate will likely be again about 800 basis points higher than last year due to the geographic earnings mix and audit settlement benefits in the base period. Third, investment levels; we'll have a significant increase in advertising expense coupled with continued reinvestment in R&D and selling capabilities. Fourth, FX; we'll continue to see significant spot rate impacts on both the top and bottom line in Q4 and, unlike the last two quarters, will not have offsets from base period balance sheet revaluation changes. Combined, we expect these four factors to lower Q4 net earnings by more than $800 million and reduce core earnings per share by more than 32% versus the prior year. For the fiscal year, we're maintaining our outlook for organic sales growth of in line to up low single digits versus fiscal 2015. As I mentioned, our outlook assumes we'll no longer benefit from sales of finished product to our deconsolidated subsidiaries in Venezuela. This will be roughly a 30 basis point drag on Q4 organic sales growth. In addition, the roughly one-point drag from the core portfolio cleanup will continue into Q4. We expect FX will have a six to seven percentage point impact on all-in sales growth for the fiscal year. Also, the combined impact of the Venezuela deconsolidation and minor brand divestitures will have a two to three percentage point drag on all-in sales growth. Taken together, we expect all-in sales will be down high single digits versus fiscal 2015. We continue to expect constant currency core earnings per share growth in the mid-single digits for the year. Foreign exchange will reduce net earnings by approximately $1 billion versus the prior year, resulting in a nine percentage point or $0.35 per share impact on core earnings per share growth for the year. With one quarter left in the year, we're tightening and improving our core earnings per share guidance range from down 3% to 8% to down 3% to 6%, which puts the midpoint of the range at $3.59 per share versus last year's core earnings per share of $3.76. Fiscal year earnings per share guidance includes headwinds of 10 percentage points from the combined impacts of Beauty deal expenses, Venezuela deconsolidation, lower non-operating income, and a higher tax rate. Adjusting for these items, our guidance translates to modest core earnings per share growth, with meaningful growth excluding foreign exchange. We expect the core effective tax rate to be 25% or higher for fiscal 2016, more than four points higher than last year, roughly a six-point headwind on core earnings per share growth. We're raising our fiscal year outlook for free cash flow to 100% or more of adjusted net earnings. We expect to reduce outstanding shares at a value of over $8 billion through a combination of direct share repurchases and the shares that were exchanged in the Duracell transaction. In addition, we expect dividend payments of more than $7 billion, in total, $15 billion to $16 billion in dividend payments, share exchanges, and share repurchases. We expect all-in GAAP earnings per share to be up in the range of 46% to 51%. Moving briefly to 2017, David is going to join me on our next call, scheduled for Tuesday, August 2, to discuss our plans and outlook for fiscal 2017. We're currently in the early planning stages for next year and will give guidance on the next call, but there are a few things to keep in mind as you review your estimates between now and then. We expect improvements in organic sales growth, though core portfolio cleanup will still be a headwind. Venezuela will be a drag on the first two quarters of the year. If currency exchange rates hold steady through next fiscal year, FX should be much more manageable than it's been for the past few years, but we'll still have a headwind on both the top and bottom line, particularly in the first two quarters. Likewise, if commodity costs hold at recent levels, we'll continue to see a modest tailwind in the first half or so of next fiscal year. We'll be increasing investment in R&D, in product and packaging programs, in sales capacity, and in brand awareness and trial building programs to accelerate top line growth in a responsible and sustainable way. We'll defend the relative consumer value of our brands and invest to address value gaps if and when they emerge. We'll do everything we can from a productivity standpoint, and we'll continue delivering on our commitment of cash return to shareholders. There will be an EPS benefit from shares eliminated with our category exits, though the exact amount of which will depend on when we actually close the Coty transaction. We'll obviously give more specifics on all of this on our next call, but we thought it might be helpful to offer you these early thoughts. To sum up, we continue to make progress on returning P&G to balanced top and bottom line growth. We're nearing the completion of the portfolio transformation. We have created and are sustaining strong cost savings and cash productivity momentum. We're strengthening the organization and culture, and we're investing to accelerate top line growth. That concludes our prepared remarks for this morning. As a reminder, business segment information is provided in our press release and will available in slides which will be posted on our website, www.PG.com, following the call. Now I'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Olivia Tong from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Olivia Tong : Good morning, thanks. Jon, you mentioned that advertising was up 120 basis points, and it's been a while since we've seen an increase of this magnitude on the ad line. So is this a level we should expect going forward, or does it still move materially from here? And then price overall came in, so how much of that was incremental promotion, step up in sampling that you're doing, and things like that? Perhaps you can break out what the impact of price was between developed and developing markets, if you could help us out there. And then just lastly, you tightened the core EPS range, as you mentioned. But given that there's just one quarter left in the year, you left the full-year organic sales target unchanged, which obviously implies an incredibly wide range for Q4. So maybe can you refine your expectations a bit there and the main factors that impact where you fall within that range? Thanks a bunch. Jon Moeller : First of all, congratulations, Olivia, on the birth of your child, and welcome back to work. You're coming back strong with four questions in one, but it's great to have you back. In terms of the advertising rates, we were up about I think 130 basis points in the quarter. We expect to be up about 140 basis points on the second half, so there will be some sequential strengthening of that comparison as we move forward. I tried to say eight or nine times in our prepared remarks that we will be investing to grow our top line. We'll be funding that with productivity and bringing to the bottom line with it. There has not been a significant increase in the percentage our business being sold on promotion, nor has there been a significant increase in the depth of those promotions. We have in several markets used sales deducts as a way to adjust pricing back to competitive levels where we took more of a price increase than our competitors ultimately did, so you see that impact. And I would just think about price adjustment and value gap closures as being the explanation for the change in the price component of the top line. And as for fourth quarter guidance, we just provided it. It is what it is. And I think that the range, you rightly point out, is a wide one. That's the reality of the world that we're operating in, with very significant volatility, whether it's input costs, FX, geopolitical and geo-economic dynamics, and the consumer impacts of things like oil prices. And we're going to be living with that volatility for the foreseeable future. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with UBS. Stephen Powers : Great, thanks. Hey, Jon, I think you called out $18 billion in gross-to-net spending, which is close to 27% \u2013 28% of your expected net revenues this year. And so first, can you just confirm that I heard that right? Second, assuming that I did, can you just talk about how that spending rate compares to maybe five or 10 years ago because I think it's up significantly? And then third, I'm curious how you assess the ROI on that spending. And as you optimize it going forward, how much opportunity do you see to reduce it? And then of that reduction, how much is likely to get reinvested elsewhere in the P&L as we think about the next several years? Thanks. Jon Moeller : So yes, Steve, you got the number right, it's $18 billion. Yes, it has increased over time, driven in part by expansion of modern retailers on a global basis, who have brought that business model with them to other parts of the world that previously were, for example, largely a distributor and wholesaler in markets. There is significant opportunity within that bucket of spend to first and foremost increase its effectiveness, ensuring that we're spending it in ways that drive category growth on a sustainable basis as opposed to short-term pantry loading, for example; shifting spending to our best product offerings, to increase the trial and repurchase rates of those items with consumers, again, not driving so much in some cases the lower end of the portfolio; the vehicles that we use to communicate in store and how those are constructed and utilized in conjunction with our retail partners. So there are just massive opportunities to improve the effectiveness of that spend as we work to reaccelerate the top line growth. There are also efficiency opportunities. And this is one of those unique and wonderful costs, if there is such a thing, where if you're able to reduce it, benefits both the top line and the bottom line. But we'll be very judicious as we do that. Again, really wanting where we have opportunities to shift that from ineffective spend to effective spend is the primary activity in this space. But I'm convinced within an $18 billion spend pool, we have efficiency opportunities. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank. William Schmitz : Hi, Jon. Good morning. Jon Moeller : Hi. Good morning, Bill. William Schmitz : Can you just give us some more color on the reinvestment strategy? So you talked about the increases this quarter and next quarter. But how long will the advertising restoration period last? Where are you going to focus? I think you talked about hair care, laundry, and diapers to start. And then what you trying to achieve? Because I think maybe the last two or three years you said market share is not a primary driver of the business. It's really about growing the categories profitably. But does that change as you feel more pressure to close the gap in organic growth versus your peers? Frankly, I think the scoreboard you have is organic growth, right? And so I think that's obviously really important. And then really quickly, just a housekeeping item; I know you don't have the exact numbers. But can you give us a rough cut at what you think the earnings upside is from both the Duracell and the Coty divestitures? Jon Moeller : You asked a very important question, Bill. How do we think about top line growth and what are we trying to achieve there, and how do you think about the different metrics, whether it's category growth, organic sales, or market share? First and foremost, we need to accelerate our top line growth rate, and there's no debate about that. The reason that we've talked a little bit about not following share out the window, we can be gaining shares in categories that are declining, and that's not going to grow our top line. What we need to be doing as innovation leaders in our categories is getting the market growing through that innovation and gaining a share of that growth. That's exactly what we're doing in Fabric Care in the U.S., for example. And it's taken a while, but it's worked extremely well. And the category is growing 4%. We're getting a disproportionate part of that growth. And that's what we are looking to do across our product categories. So it's bringing innovation to the market, which grows categories for the industry, for our retail partners, and allows us to gain a little bit of share in the process. And look, we need to be growing at the rate of the market or better, but market growth is an important element of that in terms of how attractive that growth ultimately ends up being. So it's all of the above. In terms of earnings per share upside from Duracell and Coty, I think we've talked before that we plan to be non-dilutive from day one. We've been working for two years on the stranded overheads that are going to be created as a result of this. And we also expect that the portfolio that we're going to be left with is a healthier, stronger portfolio that will grow and will grow more profitably. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Thanks, good morning. I'm not sure if you fully answered what Bill had referenced in terms of the reset on advertising spending, so I'm guessing he's still looking for some color on thoughts around reinvestment and maybe extending beyond just it being about advertising, but also the investments in product quality and packaging and timeline for that. I also wanted to get color on your comments on consumer value investments, particularly in Gillette in the U.S. and Baby in the U.S. Just in Luvs, I wonder about how you think about Luvs pricing versus private label and positioning. And then for Gillette, it seemed like you were talking about the lower end of where you compete in the shaving category. But anything else you can share there would be great. Thank you. Jon Moeller : Thanks for the save for Bill there, Lauren. Sorry, I did miss that. As I said in the earlier remarks, we're reinvesting in not just advertising. I went through three examples of sampling to generate trial, getting our best products in the hands of consumers. That's a significant portion of investment. I mentioned as well expanding our sales capacity. That's happening across some of the newer channels, but also in our existing channels, dedicating sales coverage to individual categories and sectors, which has required and will require some investment. So it's broad-based. You mentioned package. There are clear opportunities to continue to improve our first moment of truth, which is a lot about the package, and we'll continue to do that as well. In terms of specific numbers for next year across those buckets, we're in the early stages of putting our plan together for next year, but our intent is clear, I think. And as I said, we'll continue to work to fund those investments through continued productivity savings as well. On value equation, there's really no change here in terms of our intent to be competitive across price tiers on big businesses that matter and big markets that matter. And clearly that involves Grooming in the U.S. You mentioned Baby in the U.S. I'm not going to get into specifics about the pricing moves that will be made. I'm not allowed to do that by law. But we'll be competitive. I don't think \u2013 in fact, I'll leave it there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Faucher with JPMorgan. John Faucher : Thanks. Jon, you mentioned improvement in profitability, I think it was in India, over the past several years, mostly coming from I think improved manufacturing logistics in local markets. Can you talk about the state of that process? And are there still markets in emerging markets where you're losing money where you could benefit from moving that? And then I guess on the flip side of that, volumes have been weak generally. And so how do you deal with some of the stranded manufacturing capacity in some of the major markets where you've been producing this product, and is that a piece of the productivity we've been seeing for the past couple of years? And then how long do you think it takes to get to a more sustainable operating margin in some of these emerging markets on a broader basis? Thanks. Jon Moeller : On the broad question of developing market margins and steady states, I can't answer that without getting into, unfortunately, FX. The answer to the question involves what happens to foreign exchange rates going forward. For perspective, we've been growing constant currency earnings in developing markets well ahead of constant currency sales, going back three years ago 2x, the year after that 4x, last year 8x, this year 8x. And that reflects the things that you're describing in terms of the supply chain. It also reflects the overall productivity program and its benefits in the developing market, and it reflects a lot of work that we've been doing on our portfolio, as I described in our earlier commentary. The biggest driver of the really nice profit improvement in India has been that portfolio work. So it's all of that. In terms of volume and the impact that it's had on our fixed cost rates, if you will, in the supply chain, it's definitely had an impact. The good news is that we're right in the middle of the supply transformation, and that's going to be multi-geography in nature. So that gives us an opportunity, where we need to, to rationalize that fixed cost infrastructure. At the same time, hopefully the main benefit going forward in terms of that is reacceleration of volume and sales. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Nik Modi : Thanks. Jon, can you provide some context on where within the P&G organization are the pricing decisions made? And have those decisions changed, or are you planning to change who dictates local market pricing for new innovation and the core portfolio? Any context on that would be helpful. Jon Moeller : So there are two forms of pricing decisions, if you think about it. One is what I'll call strategic pricing choices. That's the establishment of the pricing strategy, the price corridors you want to hold between markets, the price corridors you want to hold between competitors, whether they be branded or retail competitors. And those choices are made by our global business units, who have representation in both regions and countries, more representation in regions and countries than at the global headquarters. These are people who are very close to what's happening in the marketplace in terms of consumption, in terms of trade customers, in terms of competitors and consumers. And then there are tactical adjustments that occur on a routine basis as each day and week unfolds. And we're trying to give more flexibility to resources located closer to the action, to manipulate \u2013 or to move agilely there as they need to. So we're going to hopefully achieve the best of both, and we'll see how that works going forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citi Research. Wendy Nicholson : Hi, good morning, two questions. First of all, can you talk a little bit more about China? I know you said that your business is showing some signs of improvement, down not as much given some of the premium price innovation you're doing. But how confident are you in the strategy of pursuing what sounds like almost exclusively premium price innovation? Because it does sound like from some of the other competitors out there that there is also price-based competition going on in some of your big markets. So if you can talk about China more broadly and the strategy there, that would be great. And then my second question has to do with your comment that I think we've heard. I think we heard it from Bob McDonald a few years ago that P&G was increasingly open to hiring from the outside. And I know we've had certain partnerships in R&D stuff. But in terms of actual physical new hires, outside of legal and tax and HR, I can't think of anybody on the business side who you actually have brought in from outside. So given that you've been saying that for so long, are there particular areas where you think that that is a priority? Is it marketing? Is it something in specific businesses? And why say it for so many years and then not have it actually happen? Thanks. Jon Moeller : So first on China, I'm glad you asked the question you did, Wendy. That big middle of the portfolio is very important, and we're not losing sight of that. We have fantastic positions in that portion of the market which we intend to maintain and build. But we also want to take advantage of the higher growth portion of the market, which is currently the premium tiers. Fifty percent of consumption is currently in those tiers across our categories. They're growing at high single to double-digit rates. And we obviously want to participate in that, not only for the sales and volume benefit, but also for the equity halo that it provides to our brands. So it is clearly an \"and\" strategy, not an \"or\" strategy. Your question on our approach to bringing in talent from outside the organization, I think David was very clear about that at CAGNY that we are going to maintain broadly our promote from within and develop from within, most importantly, program. But we are going to put the right people, the best people in jobs across the organization. And when that requires that we go outside, we'll do that. We have, for example, hired a number of experienced salespeople. I mentioned building our sales capacity. As we're dedicating selling organizations to categories and sectors, there are cases where we can find more experience outside the company, people who have had 10 years' experience in a category where we may be underrepresented, and we're bringing those people in. The whole area of digital marketing and media, where we need resources, we're either partnering with agencies who have that capability. In some cases, we're bringing it in. I don't think that's limited to any portion of the organization. That includes line management. But we're going to approach this deliberately. Having someone come in just for the sake of having them come in and being able to say that we're making progress there is obviously not something that interests us very much. But having the right people in the right jobs, bringing mastery to help us win across the board, we're definitely committed to. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian, Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : Hi, good morning. Jon Moeller : Hi, Dara. Dara Mohsenian : Jon, as you look out to fiscal 2017, are you expecting to be able to recover some of the net negative historical gap between FX and pricing from the last couple of years through pricing? Or with the lower commodities and at least less onerous FX, is pricing not expected to be a large factor next year? And then also, I was just hoping for some commentary on if you're confident that you'll see an equivalent level of volume rebound going forward as the overall level of pricing decelerates. Thanks. Jon Moeller : Thanks, Dara. I would expect pricing to be less of a dynamic next year than it has been the last two years, simply because at current spot rates FX would be less of a dynamic next year than it has been the last two years. I also mentioned that in some cases where we've had large gaps emerge, we'll be working to close those. But we're still seeing significant devaluation in some markets. There are still situations where we're going to be taking additional pricing where we feel that that will be matched. So it will continue to be a dynamic, but a little bit less going forward. On the volume piece, I certainly don't have a crystal ball. But if I look at what's happened historically, that volume has come back over time. Sometimes it depends on the market, but volume reacceleration in markets like Latin America has been fairly quick. In other markets, for example, Russia, the last crisis it took us three years to get back from a volume standpoint. So we'll have to see. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust. William Chappell : Thanks, good morning, just two things. One, on the U.S. shaving business, can you give us a little more color? It's a focus area, both the U.S. and shaving. You've had new innovation. But do you see signs that as we move through the quarter, as we move into next year that the growth dynamics can change and maybe follow more like laundry? And then also maybe for a bigger question, I understand that next year is still a transition year and you're stepping up advertising and marketing. How long does it take to get to your kind of growth algorithms excluding stuff like Russia or a global crisis per se? Jon Moeller : In terms of Grooming, this is really primarily driven by two things. One is the market, as you rightly point out, and the other is some of the promotion at primarily the lower end of the portfolio. If you look at the past three months, market consumption in tracked channels was down 4%. That's largely due to lower shaving incidences. And also that number, just the math of that number, doesn't pick up the volume from direct sellers, and that's had some impact on that tracked channel number as well. We estimate that total market growth inclusive of e-commerce sales is flat to slightly growing versus year ago, and that's an improvement versus where we've been. The top end of our portfolio is doing very well. ProGlide cartridges sales grew 18% last fiscal compared to a 7% decline in the overall market, and those kinds of trends are continuing. As I mentioned, we need to do more work on the lower end of the portfolio. We also need to be more present than we are in the direct-to-consumption e-commerce channels. And we need to bring innovation equally across the portfolio and marketing equally across the portfolio, which we're committed to do. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research. Javier Escalante : Good morning, everyone. Jon, I think that it would be helpful if you gave us a sense in a very top line way, volume and pricing between developed and emerging markets. I know that the U.S. was up 3%, but I would like to know what's happening with Europe as well. And how was the aggregate growth in emerging markets? And in emerging markets, how much of that has been \u2013 continues to be destocking in China, or are there any other one-time in terms of wholesalers' dynamics that is impacting your growth in developing markets? And again, in China, why is destocking so protracted? Shouldn't you be better off to just purge the wholesalers' inventory and just starting to roll out whatever innovation that you have? Thank you. Jon Moeller : So in terms of the breakdown between developed and developing, Javier, volume in developing was down 5%. In developed it was up 3%, which is really strong, by the way. Organic sales growth in developing was down 1%. In developed it was plus 2%. And so obviously price/mix then deductively was plus 4% in developing and minus 1% in developed. In terms of the trade stocking issue in China, we're making progress. As I said, our rate of decline was halved in the quarter, and in many categories we've returned to growth. And we're doing everything we can to bring that back in a responsible way, and we'll continue to do that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark Astrachan : Thanks and good morning, everybody. I know you don't want to give too much detail on fiscal 2017, but you talk about expected organic sales growth to improve in the year. I guess given FX headwinds in the first half and your prior commentary about not focusing on market share given FX headwinds, is it fair to say that any share improvement then would be back-half weighted? And then more broadly, how should we all think about reinvestment required to return the business to top line growth? You talk about all this reinvestment on a go-forward basis, but if there's some way that we can quantify it or measure it not just in terms of what the advertising spend is on a quarter-by-quarter basis. But is there some sort of bogey out there or benchmark that helps us figure out basically where you're headed? Jon Moeller : Fair question, Mark. Unfortunately, I have a difficult time answering that as we sit here today. We're literally just beginning the process of putting our plans together for next year. To give you some insight into that process, though, we're going to go through each of the large category/country combinations and ensure that we're efficient in terms of our investment to change the growth profile and ideally to grow at the market, and then as we go through the year try to improve that. I'm not going to call a quarter in which that's going to happen. It's going to take time, as I said in the prepared remarks. It's not going to be a straight line, but I think we'll see improvement over time. And there's no bogey in terms of a number related to investment. This is strategic planning at the category, country, and brand level that we're just beginning to do. You've seen the increased investment profile in the back half of this fiscal year. That's the only one I really have real insight into at this point. And I certainly wouldn't expect the investment levels to be lower as we go forward into next year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello with Raymond James. Joseph Altobello : Thanks, good morning, guys. First question, in terms of the 1% organic growth, can you tell us how that compared to consumption? I know it was a deceleration from last quarter, but last quarter you shipped a little bit ahead of consumption, so I was curious if that evened out in this quarter. And then secondly, just going back to Bill Chappell's question for a second, what is P&G's long-term algorithm right now given the changes in the portfolio, and how quickly can you get there? I imagine 2017 is probably too optimistic, but could we see a return to that by fiscal 2018? Thanks. Jon Moeller : In terms of the relationship between consumption and shipments, you're right. We had said in January that for the December quarter there was a little bit more sell-in than consumption and you see that reflected in the third quarter, and that's where that's really reversed itself and evened out. So I think we're in a steady state at this point in the process. I think that's also an important point in understanding the difference between the 2% last quarter and the 1% this quarter in terms of organic sales growth. That and Venezuela really explain all of that change. So thanks for asking that question. I think it would be \u2013 in terms of the long-term algorithm that has not changed. We want to be growing with the market to slightly ahead of the market. And we believe that with continued productivity progress, that should translate into mid to high single-digit earnings per share growth. I do think that getting back fully to that algorithm next year would be difficult, but again, we're just beginning to put our plans together. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Hey, good morning, folks. Thanks for squeezing me in. There we go. Can you hear me? Jon Moeller : Yes, Jason. Jason English : All right. I'm going to ask a multipart question as well. First, coming back to top line, you mentioned category growth slowing from I think 3% to 4% to roughly 3%. How much of that is volume-related versus price-related? And per your comments on the forward with FX if it holds, commodities if they hold, potentially price abating, should we expect global category growth to slow even further? And then the second question was on the savings target. This could just be a matter of semantics, but I heard you say up to $10 billion. So should we consider $10 billion as the cap and a bit of a stretch goal that may not be achieved? And also on the supply chain side, you mentioned upfront investment, savings will build in three to four years. Should we be thinking about the delivery against those savings as being further out, so a bit more protracted than what we've seen over the last $10 billion? Jon Moeller : Great. So if I just look at the difference between value growth and volume growth in the markets, to get at your question of how much of it is pricing, in developed markets, if I just look over the past year basically, volume growth has actually accelerated a little bit, gone from zero to 1%. Value growth is unchanged at about 1%. And in developing markets, value growth has gone from 9% to 6%. Volume growth has gone from 2% to 1%. So I think with that set of numbers, you can put the picture together that you're looking to put together. In terms of the savings target and the semantics around \"up to\", those are the words we've used since we first started talking about this back at CAGNY, and that doesn't imply a cap. There's no reason to cap, but it does imply a range of outcomes. And last time we said $10 billion, we over-delivered that. So again, there was no cap. I think $10 billion is a good number to shoot for, and I'm sure we'll get somewhere close to that, if not there. You may recall a conversation that some of us were having four years ago on this topic, and there was a lot of concern about whether we would actually get to $10 billion. And I said again, that's the right number to shoot for. And if we only get to $9 billion, I'm going to be pretty happy. And I look at it the same way this time around, so really no change there. On the supply chain transformation, that particular portion of the savings will come later, as we've indicated since we started talking about supply chain transformation. I wouldn't take that as indicative of the entire program. Last time around, it was pretty evenly paced across the fiscal years. That's not the design intent. That's just how it fell, and I don't see a reason for it to fall significantly different from that this time. Remember, though, and I know you know this, we are going to be reinvesting a lot of these savings. And on a relative basis more of that investment acceleration, if you will, will occur in the early years. And then as that gets fully in place, it will obviously have less of a year-to-year impact. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj : Hey, guys. I actually appreciate the tradition of always giving me the last word on the call. I hope it's a sign of respect for our work. So two things, one is I know you're pretty reluctant to talk about 2017 guidance on this call, but it would seem that analysts and investors have at least been interpreting some sort of message from you guys, given many EPS numbers have come down over the past month or so, and significantly more negatively, it would seem then, Jon, some of the messaging you've talked about at least on this call. So I'm trying to get a sense, especially with the Coty benefit or the share retirement benefit. So I'm trying to get a sense of a recap of your thinking on 2017 in terms of reinvestments and returns because clearly there are some messages being interpreted out there. And if you can balance the \"continued progress\" that your CEO says versus the not straight line that you mention and give us a little bit more color, I think it would be appreciated because there is some message getting out there, clearly. The second question is, Jon, you joked a few years ago that you wouldn't want to be CFO of P&G at a time where the dividend didn't grow. And I think we're all collectively glad that it did grow. But can you give us some more color on the 1% dividend increase? Shareholders have been waiting around for you guys for quite some time. You've had some very challenging times. The macros have been very challenging. Others in your peer group suggest that they increased their dividend a little bit more aggressively than yours. And I get your dividend yield and I get your payout ratio. But what would in the end be the true cost of a slight ratings downgrade here to reward shareholders a little bit more aggressively? Thanks for those two. Jon Moeller : In terms of the message that's being interpreted externally, I personally have a hard time sorting through that simply because of the very wide range that exists in estimates right now. So I'm not sure what message is being received. In terms of the message we're providing, it's very much the one you ascribed to David just a minute ago, which is continued progress on both the top and bottom line as well as our cash flow. And obviously, we want to accelerate all of that as quickly as we're able, but do it in a sustainable, responsible way. And as I indicated, we're just putting our plans together for next year, and we'll see what amount of progress we make. Our competitors don't sit still. Markets are volatile, and so that's where the not straight line comment comes in. I just think that's a reflection of reality. The Coty benefit in terms of the share retirement will depend on exactly when those shares get retired, but there should definitely be a benefit associated with that, and we view that as part of the overall equation. In terms of the dividend increase, as you know, we're very committed to the principle of cash return to shareholders. Over the last 10 years, as I mentioned earlier, we've returned $118 billion. This year between dividend and share repurchases and share exchange, we'll effectively return $15 billion to $16 billion. There is not a lot of juice, if you will, to the amount of cash available from a borrowing standpoint between our current credit rating and one or two notches down. So to do that to the credit rating for a small amount of additional dividend increase is not something that made a lot of sense to us. We were very happy to increase the dividend. We remain committed to cash return to shareholders, but we also need to reflect reality in our dividend planning, significant FX headwinds. We are creating a smaller company, and our earnings per share are below year ago. And we have a responsibility there, as you'll appreciate as well. So it's a balancing of those two things. I completely get and understand the question. It's a very fair one, but that's where we net it out. I'll leave it there. Jon Moeller : Thank you, everybody, for questions this morning. We'll be available for the balance of the week to talk through any of this with you. We're very happy about the progress that we're making, but we clearly understand we have more to do. Thanks a lot. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

LLC Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC Operator : Good morning, and welcome to Procter & Gamble's quarter-end conference call. P&G would like to remind you that today's discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections. Also as required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with valuable information on the underlying growth trends of the business. And has posted on its website, www.pg.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP and other financial measures. Now I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller. Jon R. Moeller - Chief Financial Officer : Good morning. I am joined this morning by our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, David Taylor, and by our Vice President of Investor Relations, John Chevalier. I plan to take you through the quarter and provide an update on productivity and on our portfolio project. David will discuss our efforts to accelerate top line growth. We'll briefly review progress in each of our 10 business categories. And we'll discuss our plans to further strengthen our organization and culture, all to reliably drive balanced top and bottom line growth. We're making progess in moving P&G's results to a balance of top line, bottom line, and cash flow growth. We increased investments in innovation, advertising, and sales coverage to enhance our long-term prospects for faster sustainable top line growth. And stabilized top line growth rates in several key markets. We have delivered another strong year of productivity improvement and cost savings to help fund this. Cash flow continues to be strong, with fiscal year adjusted free cash flow productivity of 115%. Organic sales for the quarter were up 2%. This includes about a 1-point drag from the combination of the cleanup work we're doing within the ongoing portfolio and the impact of reduced finished product sales to our Venezuelan subsidiaries. As we get through the cleanup work and annualize the Venezuelan headwinds, we'll be closer to 3% growth. Importantly, the sales growth was volume driven with organic volume growing 2%. Organic volume was ahead of year ago in every segment, ranging from plus-1% to plus-5%. Organic sales grew in every segment, ranging from plus-1% to plus-8%. Organic sales were up 1.5 points in developed markets and 3.5 points in developing markets. In North America, organic sales grew 2%, roughly in line with underlying market growth, our second consecutive quarter at this level. Organic volume in North America grew 3% for the second consecutive quarter, slightly ahead of underlying market growth. In China, organic sales were in line versus the prior year, an improvement over last quarter and another step toward returning to market level growth or better. All-in sales for the company were down 3%, including a 3-point headwind from foreign exchange and a 2-point drag from the combination of Venezuela deconsolidation and minor brand divestitures. Core gross margin increased 160 basis points versus the prior year. On a constant currency basis core gross margin was up 240 basis points, including 280 basis points of productivity improvements. Core operating margin was down 150 basis points for the quarter, due to foreign exchange headwinds and a significant increase in advertising support versus the prior year. On a constant currency basis core operating margin was down 30 basis points. Productivity improvements contributed 360 basis points of operating margin benefit in the fourth quarter. Core earnings per share were $0.79, slightly above the high end of our implied guidance range. This is a reduction of 15% versus the prior year, due mainly to foreign exchange, lower non-operating income, and a higher tax rate. Foreign exchange was a $0.07 per share, or $200 million, after tax headwind on fourth quarter earnings. Non-operating income was $0.02 per share headwind, as the base period quarter included higher gains from minor brand divestitures. The core effective tax rate was a $0.06 per share impact on core earnings per share for the quarter at 23.8%, up 540 basis points versus last year. This was a little better than we initially projected, but still a substantial increase compared to last year. These three impacts, foreign exchange, non-operating income, and tax, were a combined core earnings per share growth headwind of $0.15 per share this quarter. Adjusting for these impacts, fourth quarter core EPS was up modestly versus the prior year. On an all-in GAAP basis, earnings per share were $0.69 for the quarter, up 283% versus a prior year quarter that included a significant one-time impact from the deconsolidation of Venezuelan results. We generated $2.8 billion in free cash flow, with 145% adjusted free cash flow productivity. Over the course of the fiscal year we generated $12.1 billion in free cash flow, yielding adjusted free cash flow productivity of 115%. We were able to reduce outstanding shares at a value of over $8 billion through a combination of share repurchase and shares that were exchanged in the Duracell transaction. We paid dividends of more than $7.4 billion. In total, nearly $16 billion in dividend payments, share exchanges, and share repurchase. Now looking forward, we continue to focus on large opportunities that should be within our control, executing what is the largest transformation in our company' s history : re-accelerating top line growth with strengthened category business models; innovation plans, and where appropriate, improved value equations; step-change in cost and cash productivity; simplifying and strengthening our product portfolio; and strengthening our organization and culture, all to win more consistently. This transformation is aimed at delivering balanced top and bottom line growth and leadership value creation. Top-line growth is our biggest improvement need and is enabled by both our productivity efforts and the portfolio strengthening that are underway. I'll talk briefly about these enabling efforts, and then turn it over to David for a discussion on top-line acceleration itself. We continue to dramatically improve cost and cash productivity, with significant upside still ahead. We have accelerated and exceeded each of our productivity objectives and have now raised them. Our original 5-year cost of goods savings target was $6 billion. We delivered $7.2 billion, more than $1 billion over our initial target. We delivered cost of goods savings which were at or above target each for the last 5 fiscal years. We've reduced manufacturing enrollment by 22% over the last 4 years. This includes new staffing necessary to support capacity additions. On a same-site basis manufacturing enrollment is down about 27% through June 2016 with additional progress planned in fiscal 2017. These figures exclude divestiture impacts. In February 2012 we announced that we would reduce non-manufacturing or overhead enrollment by 10% over 5 years. As of July 1, we've reduced roles by nearly 25%, 2.5 times the original target. Including divestitures, we'll reduce non-manufacturing or overhead roles by about 35% by the end of fiscal 2017. We're reducing non-working marketing expenditures, costs that don't impact reach frequency or continuity of our advertising and trial generation programs. We were spending $2 billion per year on agency fees. Two years ago we reduced the roughly 6,000 agencies we work with by nearly 40% and cut agency and production spending by about $370 million. In fiscal 2016 we delivered an additional $250 million of agency related savings, reinvesting these savings in advertising and sampling of consumer preferred products. Over $600 million of savings in 2 years. We're driving productivity improvement up and down the income statement and across the balance sheet. Inventory days are down. Payables days are up. Net of reinvestments in innovation, sales coverage, media, and sampling, productivity has enabled us to deliver constant currency gross and operating profit margin improvement and high single- to double-digit constant currency core earnings per share growth in each of the last 4 fiscal years. We improved gross and operating margins by triple-digit indices, both including and excluding currency in fiscal 2016. We said over 4 years ago that we needed to make cost and cash productivity part of our culture, as integral to our culture as innovation. We've made significant progress, and we have significant opportunity. Our strong track record and our line of sight to additional opportunity inform our intent to save as much as another $10 billion in costs over the next 5 years. The majority of these savings will again come from cost of goods sold, an area where we have consistently met or exceeded our targets. Supply chain transformation is in its early stages, first in North America, next in Europe, then in Latin America and India, the Middle East and Africa. We're in investment mode now with savings to ramp-up in 2, 3, and 4 years. Our new U.S. mixing centers are up and running, putting roughly 80% of volume within 24 hours of store shelves. On-time deliveries and frequency of deliveries have increased. We've already seen an improvement in customer service levels, resulting in improved on-shelf availability in the U.S. at more than a point to roughly 96%. We're constructing multi-category manufacturing sites in geographically strategic locations to replace smaller single category sites in less cost effective locations. We're well underway with the construction of a new site in West Virginia that's scheduled to start production in calendar 2017. We've announced moves of production for some laundry detergent, fabric enhancer, perfume, body wash, and hair care products. And we've announced or completed the shutdown of three sites. In Europe, we've announced plans to consolidate production of laundry powders, deodorants, and hard surface cleaners to fewer plants across our European manufacturing network. We're now beginning the consolidation work in Latin America. As we make these moves, we're upgrading and standardizing manufacturing platforms to lower cost and to facilitate faster innovation. We're employing smart automation and digitization to improve manufacturing productivity, raw material and finished product logistics, and demand planning. We have additional opportunity to optimize working capital and further increase the efficiency of our capital spend. After 2 strong years of savings, we'll enter next year still spending about $1.4 billion on agency related costs. Still more room to improve. And as we fully operationalize the new focused 10 category company, there will be additional opportunities to increase organization efficiency, agility, and speed of decision making, enabled in many cases by digitization and automation. Finally, we are working to improve the effectiveness of our promotional spending. We currently spend about $18 billion in deductions between gross and net sales. We see clear opportunities to improve the effectiveness of the spend for us and our retail partners to build the value of our categories and the share of P&G brands. So again we're targeting up to $10 billion of additional savings over the next 5 years. We expect to reinvest a significant amount of the savings in R&D, and product and packaging improvements, sales coverage, and in brand awareness and trial building programs to deliver balanced top and bottom line growth. Moving to portfolio. Over the last 18 months we've divested, discontinued, or consolidated 61 brands, including the completion of the Duracell transaction at the end of February. We have 44 more brands in the exit process, including 41 brands in the deal with Coty. We're currently winding down transition support for Duracell. We've completed the systems work in standing up the Beauty business for the transaction with Coty. We've received anti-trust clearance in all markets. We currently remain on track to close the deal with Coty in October 2016. By the end of the fiscal year we'll have exited 105 brands and all of the complexity they create. These brands represent only about 6% of base period profit. Going forward, our portfolio will be anchored on 10 category-based business units and 65 brands. These are categories where P&G has leading market positions and where product technologies deliver performance differences that matter to consumers. These 10 businesses have historically grown faster with higher margins than the balance of the company. We're moving away from businesses that are more trend driven, where fashion, fragrance, and flavor drive consumer purchase decisions. We're focusing on businesses where product and performance drive purchase decisions, where there are clear consumer jobs to be done and clear objective measures of performance. These are products that consumers purchase and use on a daily basis. And they're in structurally attractive categories. Within these core businesses we're focusing our offerings, making smart choices for short-, mid-, and long-term value creation, foregoing bad businesses, even when these choices create near-term top-line pressure. In our Mexico Family Care business we've discontinued low-tier unprofitable and commoditizing products, and are focusing instead on very profitable high-tier differentiated products, moving from double-digit negative margins to double-digit positive margins. While we first talked about this a year ago, it took several quarters to sell out remaining inventories of the discontinued products. As a result, the top-line drag doesn't fully annualize until the end of this calendar year. In India, we've made a similar choice to de-prioritize several unprofitable lines of business, which negatively impact short-term top line growth rates but will lead longer-term to a much more profitable business that will grow strongly. The strategic part of our India business is growing at a high-single digit pace. Sales in the portion of the business we're fixing or exiting, about 15% of the portfolio, have been down more than 35%. The top line pain is worth it. We're making significant progress in improving local profit margins, up 750 basis points over the last 2 years. We've gone from losing significant money in India to triple-digit profits in just 2 years. We're taking a similar approach in our Fabric Care product portfolio, discontinuing product forms \u2013 additives, bars, bleaches, and tablets \u2013 and value tier and powder detergents that have been a drag on profitability and value creation. These choices are causing a top line drag on the global Fabric Care business, but improve the profitability and the long-term attractiveness of the business. The SKUs we've eliminated to simplify our Olay line-up caused an incremental drag on sales growth. As we annualize this headwind next year and as we focus our innovation and marketing support on the core boutiques and SKUs in the portfolio, we'll have set the stage for faster, more profitable growth. Combined, these choices have been causing about a 1 point drag on organic sales growth. We expect this headwind to continue for the balance of the calendar year and then dissipate in the second half of next year, as we begin annualizing these effects. So that's productivity and portfolio. Both on or ahead of track with \u2013 and this is important \u2013 a significant amount of the benefit still ahead of us. I'll now hand it over to David to update you on the top line, provide a brief status review across the 10 product categories, and talk about important steps we've undertaken to strengthen our organization and culture to more consistently create value. David S. Taylor - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Our objective is very clear : Balanced top and bottom line growth that delivers total shareholder returns that place P&G consistently in the top third of our peer group. A critically important element of our transformation is re-acceleration of our top line growth to reach and sustain organic sales growth at or slightly ahead of underlying growth at the markets where we compete. Productivity improvement and cost savings are a necessity in this effort, providing fuel for innovation, advertising, sales coverage, and trial and sampling to grow users and usage. Top and bottom line growth are not separate endeavors. They reinforce and fuel each other. Everything in this model starts with delighting consumers and shoppers, winning at the zero, first, and second moments of truth when consumers research our categories and brands, purchase them in a store or online, and use them in homes. Winning these critical moments requires consumer and shopper insights that lead to improved product innovations, consumer communication, and retail programs that lead to competitive advantages for P&G brands and products. And we're making progress in accelerating organic sales growth, but we're not yet where we need to be. There's more work to be done. As Jon just shared, organic sales grew in all five reporting segments and we're in line or higher in nine of 10 product categories in the April-June quarter. For most of these businesses, the back half of the year was stronger than the first half. Organic sales for the company was essentially flat in the first half of the year and were up 1.5% in the second half. Obvious acceleration, but not where we want to be. Let me spend a minute on each of the 10 categories. We're growing our Fabric Care business with consumer preferred brands and product offerings, like our premium performance and premium priced unit dosed detergents and our market leading, and importantly, expanding scent bead fabric enhancers. We're exiting slower growing, lower priced, more commoditized product forms, where it's more difficult to distinguish our products and create value. Fabric Care results in the U.S. demonstrate what is possible when we deliver superior value from best-in-class performance at a modest price premium. The U.S. laundry detergent market is continuing to grow behind our efforts, with the category up 4 points last year. The same is true for fabric enhancers. Spurred by the rapid growth of scent beads, the U.S. fabric enhancer category is growing, up 7 points on a value basis last year, with scent bead form growing in the mid-20s [points]. Our share is growing. P&G's laundry detergent and fabric enhancer value shares were up in fiscal 2016. And we will continue to be the innovation leader in Fabric Care. In North America, we're introducing a new regimen on Tide and Downy that addresses the odor problems common to the growing athletic wear segment. 70% of consumers wear athletic gear multiple times each week. The Odor Defense collection, anchored by innovation on Tide Pods, brings a proprietary formula of enzymes and surfactants that break down and remove stubborn soils and residue for a great cleaning and fresh scent. Now paired with the added cleaning power of Tide Odor Defense Rescue laundry booster and Downy Fresh Protect Odor Defense beads, this regimen promises to eliminate odors from the fast growing market of athleisure clothes people are wearing far beyond the gym. We opened a learning market of Tide Pure Clean liquid detergent in the U.S. Naturals is a large and growing segment in several categories, but naturals are only about 3% of the laundry category currently. Unlocking growth in naturals is about solving the tension between green and clean. People want performance and sustainability. Pure Clean provides the cleaning power of Tide with 65% bio-based ingredients. And it's produced with 100% renewable wind power electricity in a facility operating with zero manufacturing waste to landfill. Now it's very early to read results. But after just 5 weeks on shelf with no TV advertising, Pure Clean is approaching a 1 share of detergents within the learning market stores. We're increasing sampling of new washing machines, a key point of category entry and change for consumers. In fiscal 2015 we distributed 5 million samples in washing machines globally. Last fiscal year's we increased that to 17 million. In fiscal 2017 we'll distribute 30 million samples of our best performing products. Turning to Home Care. Our performance in this category has been very strong. Cascade grew sales high-single digits last year behind the continued success of Cascade Platinum, our best performing and most premium priced auto dish detergent. In North America, we increased sampling on Cascade premium by 20% last year. The Dawn brand delivered its ninth consecutive year of organic sales growth in the U.S. This result has also been strong in Japan and Europe on handwashing liquids and auto detergent products. Febreze had a challenging year, down low singles, but we have innovations coming next fiscal. In Hair Care we launched our new conditioner innovation on Pantene in the U.S. early this calendar year. The new conditioner technology is a consumer blind test winner versus our best competition in North America, China, and Japan. Pantene and Head & Shoulders each delivered solid organic sales growth in the U.S. for the second consecutive year. Herbal Essences was the main drag on the Hair Care growth, down mid-teens last fiscal year. Now we have plans in the works for product, package, and consumer communication improvements in fiscal 2017. In the Skin and Personal Care category SK-II had another very strong year with organic sales up mid- to low-teens. As Jon mentioned, Olay completed a significant streamlining of SKUs in North America last year. In China, Olay's second biggest market, we're executing a similar streamlining of sales counters, retaining the top selling and most profitable counters to focus resources where it matters most, on the doors that create the most value. On Old Spice, sales were up versus the prior year and accelerated in the second half behind the Hardest Working Collection innovation bundle that included performance and scent upgrades to Old Spice detergents and body wash \u2013 or rather deodorants and body washes in the U.S. In Grooming, Gillette delivered steady growth in international markets last fiscal, holding or growing value share in each region outside the U.S. behind strong innovation, advertising, and sampling programs. The growth in international markets was offset by soft results in the U.S. To improve our growth and the growth of the market we are reinvesting in innovation, new user trial, and improved consumer value. We completed the global expansion of our very successful Gillette Fusion FlexBall innovation into Asia in 2016. We expanded our performance advantage at the top end of the market. Our most recent cartridge innovation, Gillette Fusion ProShield, launched in January. We're supporting a broader range of our product ladder from our best product, Fusion FlexBall ProShield, to MACH3 systems to premium priced and superior performance disposables with stronger consumer value communication. We're facing more aggressive competition at lower price points. And we will respond to ensure our brands remain a superior consumer value. We're driving trial at point of market entry. We put Fusion ProGlide FlexBall razors in the hands of nearly 80% of young men. Over 2 million samples last year in the U.S. with our 18th birthday sampling program. We're now sampling the FlexBall razor handle and ProShield cartridge, our very best combination of shaving technologies. Fiscal 2016 was a difficult year in Personal Healthcare due to the very weak cough/cold season in the U.S. The category was also comparing against a base period that contained the launch of many new items in the Metamucil and the Vicks brands. Even with these headwinds the category delivered positive organic sales growth for the year. Organic sales in Oral Care were up low-single digits in fiscal 2016 with high-single digit after tax profit growth behind strong productivity improvements. Sales of our top-performing items grew fast this last fiscal with premium Oral-B power toothbrushes and premium HD toothpaste, each up mid-teens. Organic sales in the 42 Oral-B toothpaste expansion markets were up double digits last fiscal year. The solid growth in developed markets was partially offset by lower sales in several developing markets, where we took pricing to offset foreign exchange impacts. In U.S. Baby Care, strong innovation in consumer communication trial programs and a robust online presence have led to strong growth for Pampers. Pampers value share of U.S. diapers was up a point last fiscal. Pampers latest Swaddlers and Cruisers innovation, extra absorb channels, is driving share growth in the premium tier diaper category, with Swaddlers and Cruisers share up more than a point last fiscal year. We strengthened investments in brand awareness and trial at point of category entry. Now 70% of new moms in the U.S. receive samples of our best products through our Prenatal and Hospital programs. Fiscal 2015 marked the seventh consecutive year of sales and value share growth of the Luvs brand in the U.S. However, results were down in fiscal 2016 following a significant price reduction taken by our primary competitor. Now we've taken steps to improve the awareness, trial, and consumer value of Luvs. We're increasing equity building advertising, strengthening in-store programs, and we're currently launching product and packaging improvements. In Japan, Pampers value share grew more than 2 points last year. Pampers is now the value share leader in Japan diapers and also the share leader in the Pants segment. Baby Care results have been softer in other markets. To address this, we're strengthened our value proposition in several markets and accelerated premium innovation on both taped and pull-on diapers to restore our competitiveness at the top end of the market. We're strengthening our selling resources and programs for baby center stores and e-commerce. And we're increasing investments in point-of-market entry programs to drive higher awareness and trial of Pampers among new moms. Fem [Feminine] Care organic sales were up low-single digits for the fiscal year with improved momentum in the second half, including a strong fourth quarter with mid-single digit organic volume and sales growth. Expansion and leverage of innovations, such as Always Infinity and Always Discreet have been the key drivers of improved top line growth. We've also made consumer value interventions in markets like Russia to restore pricing to competitive levels, which helped in the second half. In Family Care the top-tier segments of the Bounty and Charmin brands delivered solid organic sales growth last fiscal. Now as Jon discussed, we made the choice to discontinue low-tier products in Mexico, which drove overall category sales down versus the prior year. Global bottom line results were strong with after tax profits up high-single digits in fiscal 2016. We have product and packaging innovations coming this year on the Bounty Basic and Charmin Basic brands to improve their positioning with consumers in the U.S. Now I'll look briefly at our top two markets. First, the U.S. Organic sales and shipment volume was up about 0.5 point in the first half of the fiscal year. We accelerated this growth in the back half of the year to plus-2% and 2.5% organic sales and shipments, respectively. The second half growth rates are roughly in line with underlying growth of our categories. We plan to build on this momentum. China organic sales were down 5 points last fiscal, but improved sequentially in the third and fourth quarters. The fourth quarter was in line with prior year. Progress, but nothing worth celebrating yet. In fiscal 2017 we'll relaunch product lines in several categories. And we'll implement a new go-to-market program across retailers and distributors in China. These improvements will take some time to fully take hold. Recovery will not be a straight line. But in aggregate, fiscal year results should improve. As we work to accelerate top line growth, enabled by productivity and the portfolio choices, we are transforming our organization and culture. We're making many changes that by themselves may seem small and obvious, but together they are significant and important. As an example, we've made several important changes in how we go to market. We've talked previously about eliminating overlapping resources and duplicative structures and responsibilities of marketing and sales professionals in the global business units and the market development organizations, clarifying responsibilities and strengthening accountability. Reflecting this, a while back we changed the name of our market development organizations to Selling and Market Operations, a small but very important change. We're changing our talent development and assignment planning to drive more mastery and depth. The objective is simple. Improve business results by getting and keeping the right people in the right places to develop and apply deep category mastery to win. Consistent with this, we're dedicating sales resources to categories or sectors in our larger markets. Sales resources have greater accountability back to the categories they serve, which is also a change. We're aligning incentives at a lower and more specific level of granularity to better match these responsibilities and to increase accountability. Now P&G is fortunate to consistently source and develop strong talent. And we intend to maintain our develop from within approach. But there are times when the best talent for a role may not be inside our organization. We are now implementing and supplementing key businesses with outside hiring more often when we need to field the best team possible. As an example, we've dedicated and added resources to improve category mastery in our North American Personal Healthcare sales force. Two years ago the average tenure of salespeople within the category was less than 12 months. About half of the salespeople were dedicated only to Personal Healthcare. And 100% of the people were either new hires coming to P&G with no work experience or transfers for other P&G businesses. Over the last year or so we've added resources to the Consumer Healthcare sales force. Almost half of those people have prior healthcare sales experience. Today, 100% of people selling the business are dedicated to Personal Healthcare. And the average experience level is now more than 5 years of healthcare sales experience inside or outside of P&G. Over the last 2 years we've added 115 people to the U.S. retail sales force through external hiring. And more than half of them have prior sales experience. Over the last 2 years we've increased category dedication of the U.S. salesforce by 20%, with more than 90% of salespeople now focused on one category. We doubled the number of experienced external hires last fiscal versus the prior year, bringing in experienced talent in five different levels of management, including the Vice President level. Experienced hires comprised about 5% of all management hiring in fiscal 2016. Bottom line, we're committed to getting, keeping, and growing the right people in the right place to drive better business results. Again, each of these changes may seem small and rather obvious, but collectively they're big and important changes for our organization and culture. Each area of transformation \u2013 top line acceleration, productivity, portfolio, and strengthening our organizational culture \u2013 requires change. Let me say again what I said at the CAGNY conference in February : P&G is ready to adapt, evolve, and change whatever is needed to win. We're making good progress in each of these areas. But we know our success will ultimately be graded on the sales, profit, cash, and value creation results we deliver, not on the activities that get us there. We are committed to do everything we can and to change what must be changed to deliver these results. Now let me hand it back to Jon to discuss fiscal 2017 guidance. And then I'll be happy to take your questions. Jon R. Moeller - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, David. To frame guidance, I think it's helpful to look briefly at the macro environment that confronts us as we start fiscal 2017. Category growth rates slowed throughout last fiscal year and are currently growing at about a 3% pace for our global footprint. As you know, GDP growth rate has slowed to the point that at least 10 countries have moved to negative interest rates, including Germany, Japan, Denmark, France, Italy, Spain, and Switzerland. Political, economic, and foreign exchange volatility each continue to have a large impact on the markets and on the currencies in which we operate. The recent Brexit decision is but one example of a political disruption impact that has knock-on effects on consumer confidence and resulting market growth. The recent coup attempt in Turkey is another example. We continue to face significant FX volatility, such as the recent 40% devaluation of the Nigerian currency and 25% devaluation for open market transactions in Egypt. Our ability to ensure supply and stay on shelf in many markets is dependent on our ability to source U.S. dollars. Currency exchange constraints in markets such as Egypt, Nigeria, Venezuela, and historically, Argentina make operations in those countries very difficult to manage and sometimes result in production shutdowns. In that, we continue to face a relatively slow growth volatile world, which is reflected in our fiscal 2017 guidance. We're currently expecting organic sales growth of around 2%. This includes between half a point and a point of headwind from the cleanup work within the ongoing 10 product categories. It also includes the remaining 2 quarters of headwind from lost sales to our Venezuelan subsidiaries. As we annualize more of the cleanup work, and as we make progress in markets like China, we should be getting back towards market level growth rates by fiscal year's end. We expect fiscal 2017 all in sales growth of about 1%, including a 1-point drag on growth from the net impact of foreign exchange and divestitures. Our bottom line guidance is core earnings per share growth in mid-single digits. This range reflects the volatility of the markets in which we compete. And it reflects the investments we intend to make in the business to accelerate organic sales growth in a sustainable, long term, market constructive, and value accretive way. We'll work with our retail partners to build the value of our categories behind strong product innovation and more effective in store and online merchandising of our leading brands. We'll reinvest savings to improve product formulations and packaging, sales coverage and media programs, product sampling and in-store demand creation. We'll also invest in consumer value equations, correcting value gaps and quickly responding to competitive challenges as they emerge throughout the year. This guidance includes a fiscal year average share count reduction of approximately 4%, the net outstanding share reductions from the full year impact of the Duracell deal, the Beauty transaction with Coty, discretionary share repurchase, and stock option exercises. The actual impact on outstanding shares from the Beauty transaction won't be known until the deal is completed in October and will of course be dependent on the stock prices of both companies and a transaction discount. We're forecasting a reduction in nonoperating income in fiscal 2017 due to lower gains from minor brand divestitures. The core effective tax rate should be roughly in line with the fiscal 2016 level. All in, GAAP earnings per share should increase 45% to 55%, due primarily to the significant one-time gain from the Beauty transaction with Coty. Also included in the GAAP earnings per share range are $0.10 per share of non-core restructuring charges. We expect adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% or better. CapEx should be in the range of 5% to 5.5% of sales. Fiscal 2017 will be a year of significant value return to shareowners. We expect to pay dividends of over $7 billion. In addition, we expect to reduce outstanding shares at a value of approximately $15 billion through a combination of direct share repurchase and shares that will be exchanged in the Beauty transaction. In total, over $22 billion in dividend payments, share exchanges, and share repurchase. To summarize fiscal 2017 guidance, our current forecast calls for around 2% organic sales growth. All in, sales growth will be around 1%. And we should have a small improvement in profit margins. Non-op income will be a headwind. And share count will contribute about 4% of earnings per share benefit. All current rates and \u2013 at current rates and prices, FX and commodities are a modest headwind to fiscal 2017 earnings. Significant currency weaknesses, commodity increases, or additional geopolitical disruptions are not anticipated within this guidance. While we currently expect FX to be only a small headwind for the year, it will still be a notable headwind in Q1. We'll still be impacted by significant devaluations in the U.K., Argentina, Egypt, Nigeria, among others. We'll also still be annualizing the loss of finished product sales to our Venezuelan subsidiaries. Please take these factors into account as you consider the quarterly profile of your sales and earning estimate. With that I'll hand it back to David for his closing comments. David S. Taylor - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Jon. Well, we're encouraged and optimistic as we enter fiscal 2017. We expect this year to represent another significant step toward our goal of balanced growth and value creation. We're committed to continue productivity improvement and cost savings that provide the fuel for innovation and investments needed to accelerate and sustain faster top line growth. We have created and are sustaining strong cash productivity momentum. We're nearing the completion of the major portfolio moves to simplify and strengthen the category portfolio. And we're making similar moves at the brand and product form level to improve the profitability and value creation capability of the categories we'll retain. We're strengthening the organization and culture by improving our approaches toward talent acquisition, career management, decision making, accountability, and incentives. Our standards are high. We're not satisfied with just being a little better. We want to be the best. We're making progress. And we're determined to win. But we're also realistic about the time it will take for the improvements and investments we're making to fully play out in our results. We turn it back to Jon. Jon R. Moeller - Chief Financial Officer : That concludes our prepared remarks for this morning. As a reminder, business segment information is provided in our press release and will be available in slides, which will be posted on our website, www.PG.com, following the call. Now David and I would be happy to take any questions. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank. Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, David and Jon. David S. Taylor - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Morning. Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey. A few questions on the guidance. The first is, how do you balance market share versus profitability? Because I know the organization has changed. And if I look at some of the Nielsen data, it still looks like the vast majority of the business is losing market share. And then just in terms of the fiscal 2017 guidance, can you just give us some color around how much of the incremental $10 billion of savings you think are going to come through for the year? And then just a rough cut on what advertising levels are going to be and kind of where you intend to spend the money? Jon R. Moeller - Chief Financial Officer : Sure, Bill. So in terms of the relative priority of market share versus profitability, it's an and in our view. We need to be growing at or slightly ahead of the markets in which we're operating in. We fully intend to do that. As we've said, we're going to reinvest a significant portion of the savings that we're generating behind that effort to get back to market share growth. And that will \u2013 that's started. You see it in the numbers in the fourth quarter and will continue as we go forward. Just one thing on share trends. And you're absolutely right in your overall observation. But if you look at across the five reporting segments, market share trends past 6 months, past 12 months, were better past 6 months in five out of five segments. The same holds for the past 3 months versus the past 6 months. So again five out of five segments improving. And the same for the past 1 month versus past 3-month comparison. Again, as David very clearly said, we're not where we want to be. But we're starting to see that progress as we reinvest behind the opportunities that are in front of us. In terms of the savings proration across the 5 years, this program will be a little bit more backloaded than our prior program, in part because of the nature of some of the projects that are contained in it. Specifically, the supply chain transformation, whereas I said we're in investment mode now, and the savings will come 2 years, 3 years, 4 years from now. Having said that, there will be a significant contribution from productivity again next year, which will give us the ability to increase investment in the business. We're expecting increases in advertising spend this year versus last. Think about it in the probably mid-single-digit range. We want to increase, as David said in his remarks, a sampling of consumer preferred products in trial generation. We want to be more relevant in store and online. And all of that is part of an activity system that we believe will help us restore the market share growth that we rightly cite as necessary going forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning. So the guidance for 2% organic sales growth in fiscal 2017, it still seems pretty muted, given the significant level of investment you put into place in advertising and sampling and R&D in the back half of fiscal 2016. And the plans you just mentioned in place for 2017, particularly given these discontinuations are dissipating, as you also mentioned previously. So I guess why aren't you expecting more of a sales recovery and market share payback? And then separately, are you comfortable that the level of spending, as we leave fiscal 2017, is the right level of spending behind the business longer term? Should we assume we get back to more of that normal EPS growth algorithm post-2017? Thanks. David S. Taylor - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : A couple responses. First, we are very committed to get back to a little above the market growth. And we recognize 2% is not market growth. Having said that, and Jon highlighted in the formal remarks, we've still got quite a few choices to annualize. We made the choice, and I think it's very evident in AMJ [April, May, and June] that we can get back to investing at the business at the level we need to. We also demonstrated to me in the second half of the year that we're committed to 4 quarters of brand support. The fourth quarter we increased meaningfully our media investment versus previous year. And we're going to continue that in fiscal 2017. Having said that, we will not stop making key choices where we have businesses that are structurally not profitable. But we think on balance the majority of that choice has been made, and we'll annualize it through this year. So we actually feel very good that the businesses that we have, especially post the close of Coty, that we're very well-positioned to grow sequentially. So I expect the first half to continue to make progress. Second half will be better. And much like we said at CAGNY, you're going to see just continued building of our business strength behind a very clear choice in investing in brand building. And that bias toward point-of-market entry and bringing new consumers on and investing in innovation, both in current brands but also in our P&G Ventures to ensure we're planting the seeds for the mid- and long-term future. And we're going to continue to make the investments in go-to-market capability, including sales coverage, to make sure that we can reach and win in fast-moving channels, be that e-commerce, baby stores, cosmetic stores, or wherever the consumer and shopper want to shop. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with UBS. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning, thanks. So, David, you're clearly in investment mode now, refocused on that top line acceleration, which is great from my perspective. But as Jon laid out, even after the Duracell transaction and with Coty coming to a close here in a couple months, there's still a lot of change afoot. Still a lot of cost cutting underway. So as you step back and think of what you've observed over the last 3 quarters or so as CEO, what's your confidence at this point that the people of P&G, the culture, the organization, they can truly take on both challenges at once? In other words, is the productivity culture truly ingrained enough that you can layer on a reemphasized top line focus without risk that you end up kind of breaking the back of the organization, so to speak? And then if I could, just a related bolt-on question or two for Jon. First is, you may have said this, but as you reaccelerate and reinvest, can you maintain that 100% or so free cash flow productivity? And second, should we expect a volume centric organic growth algorithm for 2017 similar to what we saw in Q4? Or is there a reason for that to reverse as you move through the year? Thanks. David S. Taylor - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Several questions there. Let me first address the culture. Of all the transformation variables, the one I'm most confident in is that P&G people are up for the challenge. I think we demonstrated this year, which is clearly the peak in terms of the Duracell transaction, the enormous complexity of the Coty transaction, folks have risen to the occasion to be able to stand up those companies, while still sequentially improving the operating companies, and while doing some of the heavy lifting in both the North America and European supply chain work. So that's a very good point. And I think at times we underestimate the amount of additional work beyond operating the businesses. But I think the heaviest load was this last fiscal year and for the next quarter. So the organization has demonstrated the resiliency. In our P&G survey the confidence that people have that the choices are right, and the confidence they have and pride they have in P&G is at all-time high. So we're going to build off that. And I have a lot of confidence in P&G people. The second one on, is productivity ingrained? My hope now is after 5 years of making the kind of improvement we have, that we've demonstrated externally, and I believe internally built the confidence, that this is critical and a key enabler for getting back to the kind of balanced top and bottom line results we need. We've certainly emphasized that. But as we've added some additional focus on bringing more users on board, I think it's been very empowering to our people. They see then the outcome of all the productivity work leading into investments and brand building innovation. And that gives them confidence that the future of the company is going to be strong. Jon R. Moeller - Chief Financial Officer : Now on the guidance points, or your bolt-on questions. As I mentioned, we're targeting 90% free cash flow productivity or better. And the or better lands at about 100%. So somewhere in that range, we'll deliver. And relative to the volume centric nature of sales growth, our current forecast for next year is very similar to the result that we delivered in the fourth quarter in terms of its reliance on volume growth as the primary driver of sales growth. Obviously as we go through the year, depending on what happens with foreign exchange in markets and our need to price, that can change. But as we sit here today, it should look a lot like the quarter we just completed. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. I'm going to actually go fairly micro in terms of your portfolio. And I want to talk a little bit about U.S. Fabric Care, because I do find it really interesting the idea that what you've been able to do in that category in the last couple of years in terms of innovation driving category growth and P&G gaining share sort of as an outcome, as being sort of the gold standard of what you'd like the whole portfolio to look like. My one worry though is that more recently I feel like some of the innovation news is getting a little bit heavy on the strive for volume. So example would be on the odor release product line. Like, why isn't driving incremental wash loads enough, versus it needing to be three products that do the job of remove the odors? Same thing on the Tide Pods. Right? The advertising with two Pods being chucked in the wash, which categorically wasn't the dosing recommendation when the product launched. So if you can just talk a little bit \u2013 I apologize for micro, but I think it's important \u2013 on innovation driving category growth? And then when you made \u2013 you sort of flipped the switch to push for volume in a way that doesn't feel quite as innovation driven? Thanks. David S. Taylor - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Lauren, just a couple comments. One, Fabric Care is a good example of what happens when we get all the elements working together. And you've seen both the category growth and the share growth associated with it. On the specific comments. We go where the consumer goes and expresses interest and/or frustration. And the athleisure area is an area she has expressed frustration. And so we're trying to address a very specific need some consumers have. And to date that's tested very, very well. And we're actually quite excited about it bringing some additional users in. And it may lead to increased consumption for existing users. But both will be important. And I think it will grow the category a little bit as well. The idea is very much to understand the needs consumers have and ensure we've got a product offering that meets them. And to the extent there's an unmet need, we will continue to innovate. The \u2013 each of the add-on products that we've had the last year, whether it's in the fabric enhancer or the base Fabric Care business, I think has demonstrated the ability to grow the category and grow the share. So to date at least, I have not seen an indication that it is causing unneeded proliferation. In fact, if I step back and look across the company, we have meaningfully less SKUs today than we had a year ago. Many categories are down 10% to 20% in the number of SKUs they've offered. But what they are doing is trying to bring more meaningful consumer benefits to areas that are underserved or needs are unmet. And then the last comment I'd make on the two pods instruction. If you look at consumer habits today, they have higher capacity washing machines. And some consumers are putting meaningfully more into each load. And what we're trying to do is provide consumers the understanding of what is the best amount of detergent or number of pods to use to get ideal performance. And in the U.S. at least, many consumers were under dosing. And this will allow consumers to get a much better outcome. And we're giving them at least the guidance so that they do get the best outcome. And it'll be up to them certainly to choose what's right for them. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yeah, thanks. Good morning. So, David, Jon, I would love your perspective. You guys have a lot of stuff going on, advertising increases, new incentive structures, delayering the organization, a focus on the go-to-market. If you were to rank the impact that some of these initiatives have had on your top line acceleration this year, I'd be curious on kind of how you think about that. And then when you think about next year, how would you think about the ranking of those same types of initiatives for next year? I'm just trying to get an understanding of things that you've put in place this year. And if they're going to kind of accelerate the impact for next year? David S. Taylor - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Nik, it's a good question. It's tough to give a company answer. I'll give just a couple comments overall, but then it's very category specific. On restarting top line growth. I would first emphasize we're getting back to making consumers aware of the product and communicating the benefits. So making sure we were consistently having the reach and frequency needed with the right message was key. And we've also I think adjusted our communication both to TV, digital, and any way that's appropriate to reach target consumers. And I believe that's going to make a big difference. A second area that is helping, and you're going to see it continue and probably increase next year, is point of market entry and point of market change focused spending. We understand \u2013 and when you look back over several years, that had gone down on many categories. And it was showing up in lower shares with entry point consumers. And that doesn't bode well for the future. And that's played out with some of the share losses that you and others have highlighted. The right way to build it back is to bring consumers in \u2013 or the best, most effective way is to bring consumers into your category when they first have the need for the category. So we have priorized point of market entry and point of market change. And that will continue and increase. We gave the example on laundry. It's also happening in many other categories. The second, which I think is critically important and that will play out consistently over time and more even in the mid- to long-term is the increased investment in innovation, ensuring that we have products that have meaningful consumer \u2013 we'll call it consumer wow. We have adjusted our valuation of innovation, to not just have technically superior products but to have products and brands that have a meaningful difference that consumers see and appreciate. This higher bar is pushing us to go back on some of the innovations coming and ensure not only the product but also the package and the experience is at a higher level, so that the consumer can play back, it's meaningfully different. An unexample (57:28) of a test that we're using frequently is deprivation. Give to the consumer a product, then take it away and get their reaction. And if you get a really significant reaction, you probably have a product that really means something to the consumer. So I would say the areas that I would \u2013 what we did focus on and I believe will be very meaningful next year would be point of market entry, continued consistent building of the appropriate reach and frequency, and then consumer meaningful and appreciated innovation that has an impact on market growth, which is the last point I'd want to make, is our innovation at times has been very focused at time to be a little bit better than our best competition. We've added the expectation for each of our categories, that their role is to grow the category size, because that has meaningful impact both on the support we get from customers but also the financial attractiveness of each of the innovations in the four categories. Jon R. Moeller - Chief Financial Officer : And, Nick, I would agree with everything David just said. Stepping back and kind of at a macro level on the kind of four pillars of transformation, productivity, portfolio, top line acceleration, organization and culture. I think the benefit from those efforts is primarily ahead of us. So the portfolio we don't complete until October. And then we still have a bunch of transition work to do to execute that big transaction. We have not yet been able to operate as a company in a 10 category focused fashion. So all of that benefit I think is ahead. Productivity, we have benefited from, and we will continue to benefit from. The acceleration, the investments really have just started in the last 6 months. And things like point-of-market entry, point-of-market change investments will increase as we go through next year. And frankly, they take some time to pay out themselves. But the payout is significant. And I think the other change that is sometimes underestimated in terms of its importance are the organization and culture changes that David talked about. I think those will be significant. And frankly we're just putting them in place. So the new incentive system goes into place in July. We moved, as David said, to dedicated sales resources in North America. We're just starting that move in some of the other big markets. So I think there's a lot of benefit ahead. Last comment as it relates to priority. These are all part of an ecosystem that's designed to work together to produce balanced top line, bottom line, and cash flow growth. And I really like them, because I think they're mutually reinforcing, as David said in his remarks. We get this top line growing. That will generate cost savings in itself through top line leverage, which will then give us the ability to invest. We'll have a motivated organization that's properly and strongly incented to deliver both. I think without getting ahead of ourselves here, again a lot of the benefit still comes in the future. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great, thanks. Just wanted to get back to sort of the savings and the spending. Can you talk about the order of magnitude of spend in the four core categories in the two key countries relative to the other six verticals? And then also, you mentioned the sales resourcing. I think you said 115 additional salespeople over the last 2 years. How does that compare to historicals? Can you quantify (1:01:15) the magnitude of change there, as well? Thanks. Jon R. Moeller - Chief Financial Officer : Sorry, Olivia. Could you repeat the last part of that question? We missed that. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Sure. It's just around you had said sales resourcing, and I think you had said 115 additional salespeople over the last 2 years, if I got my numbers right. So I was just curious how that compares to historicals, last 2 years prior to that, for example. Just understanding the magnitude of change in terms of the salespeople. David S. Taylor - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Olivia, let me start with the last one first on the sales increase. First, the 115 was for the U.S. And second, if I look back, and I have, at the last 5 years, our sales coverage has gone down. So we've had meaningful productivity improvements in sales, but our collective assessment is we probably overshot that with the focus on field sales capability, especially in fast growing channels. So if you went back and looked at the past 3 years, we were actually decreased in sales coverage. This year we added 115, and we're starting to see the impact, as Jon just talked about. It's starting to play out, and the impact will grow over time. And the first part of the question? Jon R. Moeller - Chief Financial Officer : Was about the relative support for the top four categories and top two countries. We highlight those only because of their importance to the aggregate math, quite frankly. We can't get there without progress in those areas. But all the portfolio focusing work we've done is designed to get us to a place where we feel we have the ability to win and want to drive those 10 categories. So in terms of the spending profile, if you will, it's not dramatically different across the other businesses. David S. Taylor - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : The one thing I would build on that one, on the 10 core categories we're looking at each of those through the lens of the category and what it takes to win in those category. I don't compare across, on saying just all the categories get a 3% improvement or a 1% reduction. Instead we look at what does it take to win in that category and to be a top performer on the global category. And to me that lens has uncovered a lot of opportunities. And we're broken that down one step further to manage the company by category, by country, to make sure that we're showing up and being both competitive and appropriately resourced. So the resourcing levels will look different. But in general the 10 core categories we've chosen to stay with, we intend to win in those 10. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust. William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. David S. Taylor - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Morning. William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: David, a question on kind of M&A just in general. I guess first, just to be clear with the Coty transaction, will you be completely done with all the divestitures? Will everything be done? And will you have kind of a clear focus going forward by the time I guess we talk in November? And then two, in terms of M&A acquisitions are you open to looking at things such as Dollar Shave [Club] or other things that might be in the market? Or do you prefer to really have a \u2013 work with a more focused portfolio for the foreseeable future, so that you can see the benefits of that focus? David S. Taylor - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : The answer to both your questions is yes. In terms of what we've mostly done post the Coty close, the answer is yes. The heavy lifting on the portfolio will largely be done by the end of this calendar year. And the Coty close is by far the last major step. On your second question on, am I open to M&A bolt-on acquisitions that we think are strategic and would help accelerate the growth in any of our 10 core categories? The answer is clearly yes. Our intent is collectively as a leadership team to grow our business from this point forward. And we believe we needed to make the choices that have been made and to implement the choices to get the portfolio streamlined with the 10 core categories. But in no way do we feel encumbered by any of the past. We're looking forward through the lens of each of the 10 core categories. And M&A is the tool that is open to each president. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello with Raymond James. Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, guys. Good morning. Just wanted to switch gears a little bit to China. Obviously some very nice improvement in the back half this year, particularly in the fourth quarter. I know you mentioned it's going to be a bit choppy. But could you give us what you're expecting for that market 2017? Because that could be a nice contributor to organic growth, if it does return to growth next year. And then secondly, on the $18 billion in gross to net that you guys mentioned this morning and have mentioned in the past, it sounds like, and correct me if I'm wrong, you're not looking to take that number down, but just to make it more productive. And if that's the case, maybe a little more color on the conversations that you're having with retailers in regard to that. Thanks. David S. Taylor - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. First, let me just take a cut at the China, then Jon can comment a little bit on the $18 billion between gross to net. And I'm happy to comment on conversations I've had with most of the leading customers. First on China. We see it sequentially improving. We are not done yet with hitting our portfolio right in China. That will take time. There are several categories that we are still losing share. And we're not positioned with the appropriate portfolio in the premium and super premium segments. We've started with the Oral-B effort last year. We've got some innovation also in Fabric Care. But each of the categories has stepped up both their innovation pace but also making sure they have on the ground resources in China to ensure the product and the package and the proposition have been fine tuned to really win with Chinese consumers. And that will take time. So I see that one building over time. The other comment I'd make on China, based on a lot that I've heard and read, is there has been a lot said about the attractiveness of China. Through our lens, it continues to be extremely attractive. Jon mentioned some of the reasons why. But I'd also say that the published data often shows a very rapid slowdown. And that is true in the off-line portion of the business. We see it going to very low-single digits, and some categories are now flat in China. Having said that, the online portion has accelerated and is certainly in the double- digit, but you see many categories, 130%, 140%, 150%. And what is encouraging to me is our online business is starting to accelerate. We're growing share the past 6 months. And we've at least now got a couple of our categories where our online share is higher than our off-line share, which bodes well for the future, given the choice Chinese consumers are making. So it will continue to get better over time. Over the next 12 months to 18 months, we'll see more and more innovation hitting that has been specifically designed for China versus adapted to be used in China. And I think that will increase our hit rate and our growth rate. Jon R. Moeller - Chief Financial Officer : And on the trade spending, we certainly don't intend to make broad scale cuts. That's not the design intent here. But what we do want to do is ensure that we're spending dollars, both in the form of trade spending but also in the form of marketing, in ways that maximize category growth, which benefits both ourselves and our retail partners. Now there are kind of three opportunities within that. One is, just like with our advertising budgets, including the agency and production costs, there are sources of inefficiency that we can access without impacting the market in any way or our retail partners in a significant way. And we ought to go after those. Two, ensuring that we're spending the money in a way that's most productive in terms of driving market basket, both again for ourselves and our retail customers. And we have big opportunities there to sharpen the focus of where the money gets spent and again, to the benefit of both our retail partners and ourselves. And the third one's a little bit trickier, but we have some good examples of this already, and we'll be testing others, is looking across the buckets of spend beyond trade spending. There are cases where if we would reduce trade spending, shift that money to advertising or sampling, we may be able to increase the rate of growth in a category, again in a way that's beneficial to both our retail partners and ourselves. We did some of that, for example, on Olay in North America this year and got fairly broad support for that. So you're absolutely right. We're not looking at \u2013 I wouldn't use the word cut in this space. But there are opportunities to shape the spend in a way that both increases efficiency and increase effectiveness for both us and our retail partners. David S. Taylor - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And to close on it, in conversations with the CEOs, two primary requests. Number one, grow the category. Number two, improve your SKU productivity. Both of those we're working. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah, thanks, and morning, everybody. I guess I wanted to ask sort of broadly about your thoughts on this acquisition of Dollar Shave. But more sort of openly, how you think about digital and social reducing cost of competition in categories where Procter has historically dominated? And how do you think about vulnerability of the business broadly in sort of specific areas? David S. Taylor - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Just a couple comments. The digital and social space to me is a powerful opportunity for any consumer marketing company. And it's left to all of us to figure out how to best leverage the capability that has been developed and frankly continues to emerge rapidly. P&G has shifted significantly its resources and our investments to ensure that we are showing up with communication that wins mobile back, and that's a big shift for us. And that's critically important, because whether it's e-commerce or whether it's consumption of media, in many markets it's now primarily through the mobile phone. And more and more you're seeing P&G winning with the marketing programs that are adapted for digital and social. And a good example of one \u2013 of a social program that is doing extraordinarily well is we always like to go where we've leveraged that communication and that very strong social platform, but used and leveraged the social media capability to drive the brand. I do understand and certainly it is very real that the cost to enter a category has changed dramatically today versus 5 years and 10 years ago. And part of what we are doing by category again is looking to see how do we leverage the capability that exists. I expect we'll continue to see competitors that can pop up. But generally to sustain and grow a business, you have to have a product and a product experience that meets the consumer's need. There are many, many examples of Internet-based competitors that have been popping up, both here and China. Tremendous number of those that get trial. Repurchase though is another story. And repurchase and a profitable business model is the highest bar. And that's the one that we're working against, which is to have a substantive product that meets the consumers' need, to have communication programs that meet consumers when and where they're receptive to the message, and understand they want less to be sold and less to be \u2013 and more to be part of their life. And we're adjusting our marketing and communication programs to do just that. And I think that's the right way by category to win. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge Research. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Thanks very much for the question. I actually wanted to follow up on that a little bit, about e-commerce broadly. You talked about social media, digital medias opportunities. But I mean e-commerce, clearly the Chinese consumer seems to have skipped a generation as far as how they're behaving with e-commerce. And I think it's one of your major competitors, up to like 13%, 14% of their business in China. I wonder, it seems like a lot of your other categories are susceptible, not just through vehicles like Dollar Shave Club, but through e-commerce broadly. Regular, but not awfully frequent purchase, not really impulses, not really impulse purchases, managing household inventories to a more comprehensive e-commerce strategy that could really get you ahead. I mean are there \u2013 do you have any thoughts about that? And could you talk about specifically about your e-commerce opportunities in outside of China in big developed markets, where maybe there's more upside to come? Thanks. David S. Taylor - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Sure. One, I think you're absolutely right. E-commerce is growing in most of our markets. If I look at the top eight e-commerce markets for us in the world, it would be U.S., China, U.K., Germany, Japan, Korea, France, and India. On six of those eight we're now growing share on e-commerce. And it's because we have adjusted significantly to not see it as a separate activity but an integrated part of how we go and reach consumers when and where they're receptive to shop. Our growth rate is \u2013 it varies between kind of 110% up to the highest market we currently have is 185%. And the size of our business \u2013 you mentioned China. Some of our competitors have quoted more than 10%. We're well above 10% of our business is on e-commerce and growing fast. In past 6 months, we're up 0.7 share in e-commerce in greater China \u2013 or in China specifically. So yes, it is growing. We have established efforts in each of the major markets where it is a meaningful part of our business. We now have five or six categories where it is over $100 million business and growing fast. And again, in general we're at market growth or a little bit higher on majority of our markets, the top eight markets. And then if I look even through the lens of customers, we're working very closely with any of the customers, whether they be bricks and mortars, omni-channel players, or the pure plays, to make sure that we have the portfolio and the communication that wins with them. And whether it is the big retailers in the U.S. or around the world, or whether it's the pure plays on an Amazon, Jingdong, or Alibaba, in both we're trying to ensure that we show up having consumer and shopper data that helps develop the category. And that we have the product offerings to win. And again our results the last 6 months to me speak to the pivot that we've made to make sure we show up in that segment very, very well. And the last comment I'd make is we're also ensuring that we adjust our packaging and our sizing to ensure we have the right offerings for what consumers and shoppers want that shop in that channel, again looking through each category lens. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. So I wanted to go back a little bit to price mix versus volume and sort of its implications for the industry overall please. Because, look, overall in the quarter clearly your price mix was lower than I think expected. And certainly lower than peers, given especially currency movements and inflation, et cetera, but volumes came in a little bit higher. Even where you didn't have the kind of FX issues, your North America \u2013 I think, Jon, you said \u2013 volume was up 3%, sales up only 2%. And you said that that's the pattern we should expect going forward, so leaning more on volumes than price mix overall. I guess I'm trying to figure out what that suggests about the competitive environment we should expect in HPC as you execute your turnaround plans? I mean even if you think about 2017, obviously mid-single digit EPS growth, so just not a lot of EPS growth beyond Cody and Duracell. Every \u2013 all of the cost savings you're talking about. All of that top line growth is going to be reinvested in the bottom line. And it is going to be reinvested in the market. So it feels like you're planning to win by outspending your competitors massively, which sounds like it might be a little bit tough for everyone in HPC right now. And perhaps not sustainable longer term even for you guys. So love some help on figuring out what I'm missing on that? Because it sounds a little frightening right now. Thanks. Jon R. Moeller - Chief Financial Officer : I'll start here. I'll let David chime in. If you look at price inclusive of promotion as a component of top line. We've been neutral to positive for 23 straight quarters and 12 consecutive years. And I don't think that relative preference in the drivers for business growth changes going forward. But we've had two dynamics that we've been dealing with in the last year that kind of inform next year's view. One is we've been pricing significantly to recover foreign exchange impacts, which has resulted in volume being less of a component of the top line. In fact, in many cases a negative component. We're hopeful that we're going to be operating in a more stable currency environment. So that volume negative goes away. Also as you have and others have rightly pointed out on several occasions, we've had category country combinations where our pricing got too high. In many cases that's where we were trying to recover from devaluation, and competitors didn't follow. In other cases, David talked about Luvs in his prepared remarks, and a major competitor took pricing down in that segment. And we'll be adjusting prices to deal with those realities, which makes price in those instances less of the top line component and volume more of it. We have no interest in spending unproductively. Our intent is to drive, as David said, category growth. And we do not see the business in most parts of the world through a zero sum lens in any way. David S. Taylor - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : The only other idea (1:19:59) I would make is completely agree that the lens that we're looking at in each category is what can we do in innovation and brand building, both of which are taking investments to grow the category both through the short-, mid-, and long-term. We have not yet completed entirely and annualized the value investments that needed to be made. And it's been most acute in places like Russia, where the differential impact we had was very severe for a U.S. domiciled company. And you're seeing even Russia volume share has recovered. And until we annualize that, it will show up with the dynamic that you highlighted. But there, our front half was below 100% and our back half is double-digit and especially the fourth quarter. That will annualize, and we get back to exactly what Jon said, which is our business model is very, very clear, which is we want to invest in innovation and brand building, especially focus the brand building at bringing consumers in. And then we want to delight them so they stay with our brand. And the spending is heavily focused there, other than some selected value interventions, almost all driven by foreign exchange and the category settling out to a place where we're back in an acceptable price corridor. And we're getting to the end of that. Jon R. Moeller - Chief Financial Officer : I would just add one last piece of perspective. Many of us have discussed this previously. But where we have a choice to spend a dollar on innovation, on brand building, building our equities, or on promotion, I think David and I would both spend that dollar every day on the first two items. And the reason is very simple. There's nothing proprietary in promotion. It doesn't build sustainable advantage. Where the other forms of spending can, when we get them right. So I just offer that as a reminder to how we think about the operations of the business. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jeffries. Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC : Hey. Good morning, guys. So question, David, on competitive dynamics in North America, but specifically two notable transactions announced. You touched a little bit on the Dollar Shave dynamic with Unilever. I wanted to ask that a bit differently. Specifically, are you anticipating greater investment there? It would certainly seem like, given the scale that Unilever brings, that that would be a reasonable expectation. Is that yours? And is that contemplated in the guidance? And then also if you could comment on Henkel's acquisition of Sun. And specifically there what's your expectation? And do you see a more conducive setup for pricing rationality now in U.S. liquid? Because we've seen episodic price wars through the years there. But now are we at a level of industry consolidation that should lend itself to greater pricing rationality? Thank you. David S. Taylor - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, first, the Dollar Shave, but Unilever's acquisition of Dollar Shave Club. We have already this year increased our support for our U.S. shave care business, and we'll continue to make sure we support it at a level required to get back to growing. The strategic choice we made that I highlighted earlier, which is very important and it should play out positively, in spite of Unilever's acquisition of Dollar Shave Club, is activating more than just the high end of the portfolio. Where we've been most vulnerable is at the mid- and lower tier. And if you look at our share losses, that's where they've been most acute. And Dollar Shave Club has come in with in some cases a lower absolute cash outlay. Not a better performing product, and actually not a better value product when you look over time. And for that reason we have \u2013 and we've had other challenges, which I think are well known in private label and in disposable. So we've gone back and innovated on all three tiers and also addressed and now funded marketing programs and developed a disposable, the MACH3 segment, both in innovation and brand support and on the premium tier. To me, that will continue to be funded. That is anticipated in our guidance. That's part of the base plan for fiscal 2017 for shave care. Moving to the second one on Fabric Care, Henkel's acquisition of Sun. Certainly we're very aware. There was a lot of concern if you go back a year ago with Persil, when it came in that that would have a real detrimental impact on our business. And the view we took then is the same view we take now, is there will be dynamics in the marketplace that could change. And we'll see how the category sorts itself out. But the way we were able to win is the same strategy going into fiscal 2017, Fabric Care focused on consumers and shoppers. They brought aggressive innovation to make sure that they're meeting the shoppers' needs better than anybody else, premium performing products. And they did a great job communicating and sampling their products. And you see this fiscal year built into our guidance is increased level of sampling. And with a broader sampling program as well as the marketing program that is in place, and I just mentioned some additional innovation coming on the product front, I think we're actually well positioned. And the objective going in, independent of what happens in terms of industry consolidation, is that we win with consumers and shoppers. And we'll see how it plays out on the other point. Operator : And your final question comes from the line of Caroline Levy with Credit Agricole. Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC : Good morning. Thanks a lot. Question, I have to go a little deeper on China please. You've got maybe five or six major categories. Just looking at diapers, Olay specifically, and Hair [Care], could you talk about what product innovations \u2013 what level of product innovation you see coming? Any sort of granularity would be helpful. Because it seems in diapers the Japanese are discounting their product. And there's a big shift in where things are bought. In Olay, we just haven't heard a lot recently. And in Hair, I think you've still got issues with your biggest brands there. So that would be helpful. Thank you. David S. Taylor - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Certainly. I'll take each in turn. On all three, yes, there are innovation, important innovations coming in fiscal 2017. Some of them have not been announced, so I won't get into any specifics. Diapers, we know we got behind on diapers. And it shows up, and it's one of the most acute categories in terms of share loss, period. The category is very \u2013 understands it and the category is refocused on winning in China. We, 6 months, 9 months ago, made a choice that we're going to win in China. And then allocated the resources and the capital to ensure that we had the appropriate product innovation coming. It's not yet publicly announced when some of these major innovations are coming. But on both diapers and pants, we're very committed to win. An encouraging sign to me about the future in China is to look at what we've been able to do recently in Japan. Where in Japan you're seeing us now take share leadership. And frankly, we're losing to primarily Japanese competitors, have done extremely well in China as well as K-C [Kimberly-Clark]. And the innovation that we have coming over the next fiscal year and beyond we think will position us well. On Olay, our first step was to get our portfolio cleaned up. That's been done. If you step back and look at the four core collections on Olay, we're starting to see a meaningful difference, which is to me a very positive sign, and that's Total Effects, Regenerist, our whitening segment in ProX. On those we see back half doing better than second half. We still have to anniversary some of the discontinued SKUs. And the second key innovation on Olay will be getting our counters right. Our counters \u2013 and having been to China many times and previously lived in Greater China \u2013 our counters have gotten quite tired and had not been upgraded recently. So we've shut down the counters that are in stores that aren't productive. And we've made meaningful investments in upgrading the counters in the stores that we think we have a basis to \u2013 places where we have a basis to complete. So counter innovation is coming. It's already happening. It is funded and showing up now. And the innovations will be coming on primarily the four core collections, and then some new innovations that we'll be bringing in. The last category is Hair. Hair is our largest category in China. We have meaningful innovations coming on both the conditioner, they're superior \u2013 and I mentioned earlier. It's already been launched in the U.S. and launched in China. It is superior performing. We have Hair innovation coming on many of our brands. Pantene and Head & Shoulders have historically been stronger. VS is actually growing share. And we've got innovation coming on Rejoice, which has been the weakest of our brands in China. So on each one of the brands, there's focus. We've also made the choice, funded and staffed on the ground resources to ensure we keep up with the pace of innovation required in the Beauty segment, which to me is an important choice about winning in the future in China. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day. Jon R. Moeller - Chief Financial Officer : Thank you.",

Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC Jon R. Andersen - William Blair & Co. LLC Operator : Good morning and welcome to Procter & Gamble's quarter-end conference call. P&G would like to remind you that today's discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections. Also, as required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful information on the underlying growth trends of the business and has posted on its website, www.pg.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP and other financial measures. Now I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: Good morning. I'm going to be relatively brief today. Our results are fairly straightforward and we're together soon for our Analyst Day, when we'll go in much more detail on our progress and plans. Our first quarter results mark a good start to the new fiscal, though work and opportunity remain. One of our key priorities has been to accelerate top line growth. Organic sales for the quarter grew 3%. This includes about a 1-point drag from the combination of the rationalization and strengthening work we're doing within the ongoing portfolio and the impact of reduced finished product sales to our Venezuelan subsidiaries. Top line growth was broad-based across categories and across markets. Organic sales growth in the U.S. progressed from 1% in the first half of last fiscal year to 2% in the second half to 3% in the quarter we just completed; growth in China minus 8% to minus 2% to plus 2% over those same time periods. We've been making sequential progress in each of our largest categories : Baby Care minus 2%, flat, to plus 2%; Grooming plus 2% to plus 3% to plus 3%; Fabric Care plus 1%, plus 1% to plus 5%; and Hair Care minus 1% to flat to plus 2%. Since last September, organic sales grew in each reporting segment and in all ten product categories. Still, as I said before, work and opportunity remain. Hair Care and Baby Care, two of our largest categories, were both up 2% but below the rates of market growth in these categories. These businesses along with the Grooming business in the U.S. represent notable opportunities for further top line acceleration. Organic sales grew in each region and in 9 of the 10 largest markets. Here too opportunities remain. Sales in the UK, which continues to be a very challenging, highly promotional market, were down 2%. Organic sales in China and Russia were both up 2%, but again below the pace of market growth; so in summary, progress with more work to do. Sales growth in the quarter was volume-driven. Organic volume was up 3%. Pricing and mix were each essentially neutral to our organic sales growth. All-in sales for the company were in line with the prior year, including the 3-point headwind from foreign exchange. As we move forward, progress will not come in a straight line. There will be quarter-to-quarter volatility. Comps will get more difficult. We need to manage significant geopolitical and economic volatility in markets like Egypt, Nigeria, Argentina, even the Philippines. And of course, our competition is not standing still. We still have work remaining in some categories and markets to get our brands back to market levels of growth. These opportunities need to be addressed category by category, market by market, channel by channel. We're after it, but it won't happen overnight. Moving to the bottom line, core earnings per share were $1.03, up 5% versus the prior year. Foreign exchange had a negative 7-point headwind on the first quarter earnings. On a constant currency basis, core earnings per share were up 12%. Core gross margin increased 50 basis points versus the prior year. On a constant currency basis, core gross margin was up 130 basis points, including 190 basis points of productivity improvement. Commodities were a modest hurt to gross margin in the quarter. Feedstock costs for propylene, ethylene, and tropical oils are up as much as mid-teens since we set our initial budgets for the year. Wage inflation is also an increasing challenge in many developing markets. Productivity improvements contributed 270 basis points of operating margin benefit. We reinvested a significant portion of those savings in product and packaging innovation, media reach and continuity, sampling, R&D, sales coverage, and targeted consumer value adjustments in order to accelerate our top line growth. Core operating margin as a result was up 20 basis points for the quarter. On a constant currency basis, core operating margin was up 120 basis points. The core effective tax rate was 23%, about a point below last year's first quarter level. This includes the adoption of new accounting standards for share-based compensation, which reduced the quarterly tax rate by about 3 points, about $0.04 per share of benefit to core earnings per share. The impact on the balance of the quarter this fiscal year from this accounting change is expected to be minimal. The fiscal year impact of this change was assumed in our initial guidance for the year. All-in GAAP earnings per share were $0.96 for the quarter, also up 5% versus the prior year. We generated $2.3 billion in free cash flow with 85% free cash flow productivity; returning $2.9 billion to shareowners, $1.9 billion in dividends, and $1 billion in share repurchase. Our share repurchase flexibility was limited in the first quarter due to trading restrictions related to the Coty transaction. The day after the quarter ended, on October 1, we reached a very important milestone in our portfolio transformation program, closing the Beauty transaction with Coty. This marks the completion of the most significant portfolio transformation in P&G's history. We have created value for shareowners every step of the way, including over $4 billion versus our keep price in the Beauty deal. While we will be supporting transition efforts for some time, we can now begin focusing our efforts on the 10 core categories we identified two years ago. The market in each of these 10 core categories is large and is growing between 1% and 7% per year. These are structurally attractive categories where P&G holds leading market positions. Our businesses in these categories have historically grown sales a point faster than the company and held margins that are 2 points higher than the company average. They leverage P&G core strengths of consumer understanding, innovation, branding, and go-to-market, and benefit from the company's scale. Consumers use these categories on a frequent basis, typically daily. Purchase choice is driven more by product performance against a clear consumer need or job to be done than by self-expression or fashion trends. These categories lend themselves to innovation, which creates noticeable superiority. We'll compete within these categories from the top of the market, building down across middle price tiers that are profitable and growing. We will not compete in the lowest price tiers, which are generally commoditized and where no money is made. We will, however, serve cash constrained consumers with smaller, more affordable pack sizes, requiring less cash outlay per purchase. We're in the midst, as you know, of exiting unprofitable commoditizing price tiers, forms, and segments, enabling us to focus our resources on forms and segments that are profitable and growing. Our objective for the new 10-category company is very clear, balanced top and bottom line growth that delivers total shareholder return that places P&G consistently in the top third of our peer group. I spoke earlier about the reacceleration of our top line, and we're going to spend more time on this on Analyst Day. This is critically important. But productivity improvement and cost savings are also a necessity in achieving our TSR objective. They provide fuel for investment and innovation, advertising, sales coverage, trial, and sampling to grow our brands and grow our categories and build margin. Top and bottom line growth are not separate endeavors. They reinforce and fuel each other. They're part of the same ecosystem. They live together and depend on each other. They can't be separated. Last fiscal year we completed our first 5-year productivity improvement program, accelerating and exceeding each of our cost savings and enrollment reduction objectives. We saved over $7 billion in cost of goods sold. We've reduced manufacturing enrollment by 22% over the last four years. This includes new staffing necessary to support capacity additions. On a same-site basis, manufacturing enrollment was down 27% through last fiscal, with additional progress planned this year. We reduced the number of manufacturing platforms we produce with by 30% over this same period. Over the last five years, we've reduced non-manufacturing roles by nearly 25%. This excludes the impact of divestitures. Including divestitures, we've reduced overhead roles by about 35%. As we've decreased the size of the organization, we've also simplified it. We've gone from managing the global business through 50 market cluster organizations to just 25. We've simplified our network of suppliers, reducing, for example, commercial agency support from 6,000 vendors to about half of that. Including reinvestments in innovation, sales coverage, media, and sampling, productivity has enabled us to deliver constant currency gross and operating margin improvement and high single to double-digit constant currency core earnings per share growth in each of the last four fiscal years. We improved gross and operating margins by triple-digit indices, both including and excluding currency, in fiscal 2016. And we continued the trend in Q1, with double-digit constant currency core earnings per share growth and triple-digit constant currency margin expansion. We're driving productivity improvement up and down the income statement and across the balance sheet. Inventory days are down about 10 days over the last five years. Payables days are up more than 30 days, enabled significantly by our supply chain financing program. We've made significant progress and we have significant opportunity. Our strong track record and our line of sight to additional opportunity inform our intent to save as much as another $10 billion in cost over the next five years. We expect to reinvest a significant amount of the savings in R&D and product and packaging improvements, in sales coverage, and in brand awareness and trial building programs to deliver balanced top and bottom line growth, which brings me to fiscal year guidance. We're maintaining our organic sales and core earnings per share outlook for this fiscal year. The first quarter was a good start, but comps get more difficult and we continue to face a relatively slow growth volatile world. We're expecting organic sales growth of around 2% for the year. This includes between 0.5 point and a point of headwind from the portfolio rationalization and strengthening work within the ongoing 10 product categories. It also includes a headwind from lost sales to our Venezuelan subsidiaries in the first half of the fiscal year. We expect fiscal 2017 all-in sales growth of about 1%, including around a 1-point drag on growth from the net impact of foreign exchange and divestitures. Our bottom line guidance for core earnings per share growth is for core earnings per share growth of mid-single digits. This range reflects the volatility of the markets in which we compete, and it reflects the investments we tend to make in the business to accelerate organic sales growth in a sustainable, long-term, market constructive, and value-accretive way. We continue to forecast a reduction in core non-operating income in fiscal 2017 due to lower gains from minor brand divestitures. The core effective tax rate should be roughly in line with the fiscal 2016 level. All-in GAAP earnings per share should increase 45% to 50%, including the significant one-time gain from the Beauty transaction with Coty that will be recognized in the October \u2013 December results. Also included in GAAP earnings per share are approximately $0.10 per share of non-core restructuring charges and $0.13 per share of charges related to early debt retirement that we initiated earlier this month. At current rates and prices, FX and commodities combined are about a $0.12 per share headwind to fiscal 2017 earnings. Significant currency weakness, commodity costs increases, or additional geopolitical disruptions are not anticipated within this guidance range. We expect adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% or better. Fiscal 2017 will be a year of significant value returned to shareowners. We expect to pay over $7 billion in dividends. We reduced outstanding shares by $9.4 billion in the transaction with Coty, and we expect to make over $5 billion of direct share repurchase; in total, about $22 billion in dividend payments, share exchanges, and share repurchases this fiscal year. We look forward to seeing many of you at our Analyst Day here in Cincinnati on November 17 and 18. David Taylor will lead this session. We'll have nearly all of our top leadership team available to meet with you on the evening of November 17, with many of them discussing their businesses during the management presentation on November 18 along with David Taylor and myself. If you can't make it to Cincinnati, we hope you join the webcast of the presentation on the morning of November 18. That concludes our prepared remarks for this morning. I'd be happy to take questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. Your first question comes from the line of Steve Powers with UBS. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Hey, Jon. Good morning. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: Good morning, Steve. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : So clearly a good start to the year, and as you say, a fairly straightforward quarter, all things considered. But now we look forward, and I guess my question -really, the question I've been fielding for the last hour or so, is where do we go from here? I know you don't want to give quarterly guidance and I don't expect you to, but just given how significantly the year-over-year comps ramp in Q2 and really how significantly the volume comps ramp all the way through Q4, I was hoping you could just help frame for us your expectations for the OND (15:07) quarter, and really the cadence of organic growth over the balance of the year, fully appreciating your not in a straight line comments. Because the optimist in me wants to believe that we'll start to see incremental returns on all of this investment you've been making in the last nine months. But then the pessimist in me says, this Q1 momentum may be short-lived as Q2 rears its head. So again, I know it's tough to call quarters, especially in this environment, but maybe just a little more context around how you're measuring returns on the investments you've made so far, where you're seeing the biggest bang for the buck, and again, how you're thinking about top line progression over the balance of the year. Thanks. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: Thanks, Steve. I think you said several important things \u2013 or repeated several important things. One is, not a straight line. Two is, increasingly difficult comps. Obviously, we start the year with a 3% and provide guidance for the year at 2%. There will be a quarter or some quarters below 3%. We've also said that we want to exit the fiscal year closer to the rate of market growth in our categories, setting ourselves up for a strong subsequent year, and so that backs you in to the next two quarters being the more challenging ones in front of us. And that's really as far as I want to go in terms of specific guidance. In terms of return on the investments we're making, I think you see that, both from a top line and a bottom line standpoint in the first quarter. On a constant currency basis, very significant returns, with 12% core earnings per share growth on 3% top line. We are reinvesting, as we said we would, productivity savings. But as we also have said we would, we're going to continue to modestly improve margins. And that is the only recipe for sustained success in this industry, and we're intent on following it and so far are pleased with the results. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital. Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, good morning, everyone. Jon, maybe you can help us, following up on Steve's question, just the cadence of the reinvestment or the investment both from a marketing and an innovation perspective. Just trying to understand which quarters are going to be heavy in terms of those investments and new product launches. And then just a quick follow-up, bigger picture, Kathy [Fish] took over the R&D function a couple years ago. And usually when you have leadership changes in R&D, it takes a couple of years to fill the pipeline. So I just wanted to get your assessment on what the upstream and the current pipeline looks like in terms of, on a scale of 1 to 10, how you would view it in terms of the immediacy of the new products actually hitting the marketplace. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: Thanks, Nik. I apologize in part for my first part of this response, but I really think on a daily basis in terms of fiscal years, not quarters, as you know. And so I really don't even know from a marketing spending exactly what the breakdown or the plan is by quarter. But I know that over the year, we're going to continue to reinvest productivity savings. Those will be more significant as the year progresses. We've also said we want to increase our continuity of marketing spend and trial and sampling building programs, so I expect that statement to lead to relatively constant levels of increase across the quarter. But it's honestly a figure by quarter I don't have currently in my head. The second part of your question about the cadence of new product introductions, we have significant programs coming to market in the third quarter and another batch towards the end of the fourth quarter. In terms of new product launches, the second quarter will be relatively light. And honestly, I've forgotten the last part of your question, but feel free to call me later today and I can catch you up on it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks, good morning. Jon, I was just struck by toward the end of the call you really emphasized some words like market constructive and value-accretive way of reinvesting. So I was just curious about thoughts and actions in terms of consumer value adjustments as you addressed in the press release and in general the status of your relative pricing in some of your major categories and markets, so 2x4 would be great. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: Thanks, Lauren. I'm glad you picked up on that because this is important. In the new 10-category company where we have leading positions across those categories, we become increasingly dependent on moving markets, on growing markets. There are category/country combinations where we have 60, 70, 80, 90% market shares, so one more point of share isn't the margin of victory or defeat. And that doesn't mean that share isn't important. Share is important. But we need to be growing markets, increasing the number of users for our brands, and that's what our activity system is all set up to do. So when you talk about, for example, increasing trial and sampling at point of market entry and point of market change with noticeably superior products, that moves markets over time. And being able to price behind superior innovation also moves markets over time. What doesn't move markets is, for example, leading the march down on promotion spending. If you look at the quarter we just completed, price inclusive of promotion was a neutral contributor to the top line. It has been a neutral to positive contributor to the top line for the last 24 quarters. It has been a positive contributor for many years, I think it's 12 in a row. So that's going to continue to be what we're going to emphasize, which is market accretive, market constructive, growth-driving investments. Now having said that, we won't be successful in that endeavor and maintain our shares if we're uncompetitive. And so we will take moves where warranted to ensure that we're offering a competitive value proposition to consumers. We've made several of those moves in the last quarter. What moves happen in the future will be largely dependent on where others take us. But thanks for picking up on that point; it's an important one. Operator : Our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey. So I want to build on that because despite the language of market accretive and market constructive, your last two quarters have clearly shown a shift towards volume growth versus price/mix. I guess a long-term trajectory, but a long-term trajectory from a top line perspective hasn't been that great. But just now it's starting to look a little bit better, again, volume being the driver. So how do you think about the balance of investments between innovation and ad spend, sampling, and versus less than pure pricing on the top line? Because the perception we're hearing and you heard one of your competitors yesterday say it effectively. The perception you're hearing from them and some of your other competitors is that it is just starting another price war. We've heard this from P&G before. It's going to be a pyrrhic victory or at least a fleeting victory for now. So how do you get comfortable that that's not going to be the case? You can't really control the perceptions of competitors, obviously. But the perception is already clearly forming. So how are you sure that it's not going to be a pyrrhic or fleeting victory for you guys, and how do you think about the competitors' reaction to you guys clearly being a little bit more aggressive and pushing more volume? Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: Thanks, Ali. We do expect \u2013 we compete in a very strong industry with strong competitors, and we expect them to be working just as hard as we are to protect and build their businesses. And that's one of the factors that I cited in terms of guiding to 2% top line growth on the year against the backdrop of a 3% Q1. In terms of ensuring that we're engaged in the activities that best support our brands and businesses, there's really not an aggregate answer to that, though I'm comfortable in aggregate. That's really a choice that's made at individual categories and countries. And the way I think about this very simplistically is in line with your question. If we grow business by, for example, significantly increasing promotion spending, that will be \u2013 I think you're absolutely right \u2013 a pyrrhic victory. Why, two reasons; number one, nothing proprietary can be matched instantly. That's very different than a successful investment in innovation or equity building or sampling which can create unique advantage. Two, promotion spending by definition, almost by definition, is market dilutive, whereas those other activity streams can be, if executed with excellence, market accretive, and that's just a better place for us to be in. So I'm not going to give a formula or an algorithm, not because I'm afraid of giving one, but simply because it doesn't exist at an aggregate level. That's not how we manage the company. But the emphasis points will continue to be focused on long-term drivers of market growth and brand growth, long-term drivers of new users to our brands, but short-term competitiveness. Operator : Your next question will come from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank. William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, Jon. Good morning. I'm going to try to sneak in two questions in one. So the first is, why do you think organic growth grew almost \u2013 actually more than 3 points faster? That would have implied by some of the tracked channel data. And so maybe is there a difference between shipments and consumption? And then on the gross margin side, it seems like most of the currency transaction pain, it probably peaked this quarter and is over. So how do you think about that trajectory and how much of that money has to be reinvested back in the business? Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: Thanks, Bill. First of all, from a comparison of reported results to tracked channel trends, reported tracked channel trends, there are two big drivers within that. One of them is simply the amount of business and the relative growth of that business that's moving online versus offline and to non-tracked customers like Costco, as an example. So in the U.S., for example, that explains about a point of difference, a full point of difference between the tracked channel sales growth numbers and our reported sales growth numbers. In China, that number represents a 5-point reconciliation item between those two numbers, so that's becoming increasingly significant. And as you know, the relative growth rates there are very, very different, 30% in one to call it 3% \u2013 2% in the other. The other difference that exists in the U.S. tracked channel reports, as it should, is the inclusion of the Beauty businesses that were transitioned to Coty as of October 1. So any of the share reports or sales growth reports that have come out to date rightly include that business. They won't going forward. And that dynamic in the U.S. explains about 0.5 point of difference between the tracked channel numbers and the core non-discontinued business numbers that we're reporting today. And that's about \u2013 that's another big part of the equation. We do have one situation which I'll make you aware of that falls into your last bucket, which is timing differences that would affect the different quarterly reporting numbers, and that's in China where we transitioned our Hong Kong business to a new distributor. And so there's some pipeline fill to that distributor in the numbers on the quarter, call it 1 to 2 points, relatively small on a total company basis, but that's a 1 to 2-point impact in China itself. So those are the primary drivers of the differences. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of William Chappell with SunTrust. William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks, good morning. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: Good morning, Bill. William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hey, Jon. One thing you said in the prepared remarks is talking about Hair Care and Grooming as opportunities for growth, and I just wanted to drill into that. And are they really \u2013 what we've seen, especially in Grooming, over the years, ups and downs, and you're the dominant player in the category. Is that something that you can get back to reasonable growth? And as you look across all the categories, do you think now with Beauty out, all of them can grow in line with expectations, or are there some that will be laggards over time? Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: If you just look at the last two quarters on a global basis for Grooming, we grew organic sales 3% in the quarter that we just completed, and the prior quarter we grew 3% as well. We continue to have significant opportunities on the Grooming business for growth. Certainly, the developing market opportunity is very significant. But there are opportunities as we increase our relevance from a channel standpoint, as we increase our relevance from an opening price point standpoint, as we increase innovation across each of the tiers of the business, whether that's disposables, mid-price systems like MACH3, or at the high end. So I do see that as a market that offers growth opportunities to us. And I feel that way about every business within the portfolio, especially relative to the metric of market growth. The market growths are different across the categories. I mentioned in the prepared remarks they range anywhere from 1% to 7%, and so I would expect our businesses to grow at slightly different rates. And obviously the geographic opportunity is different by market. But in general, we settled on this portfolio because it's one we feel we can grow and can do so profitably. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: Good morning, Dara. Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So, Jon, you articulated that there's room for efficiency in your $18 billion promotional budget previously. That's obviously a very large bucket. So I was just hoping you could give us a bit more granularity on if your efforts in that area are supposed to yield actual savings that are substantial that you can drop to the bottom line over time. Or is your approach more to redistribute any of the potential efficiencies back to drive more effective spending and hopefully higher top line growth over time? And then also, when do you expect the promotional efficiencies to really ramp up and take hold from a timing standpoint? Thanks. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: The idea here is to increase both the efficiency and the effectiveness of our spend across the elements of the marketing mix. And there are many cases where promotion spending is a very effective use of our funds, and we'll continue to support that spend. There are other instances where both we and our retail partners would be better off redirecting that spending to other elements of the marketing mix, focusing back again on how can we drive market growth in our categories and how can we drive shopping trips and basket size for our retail partners. And it's really working together in a joint context to identify where those opportunities are, where today we're potentially both engaging in activities that are both market and profit dilutive to both sides of the partnership, and looking for ways to redirect those funds in a way that can be more accretive to both sides of the partnership. I do not see this as being a significant source of bottom line help. I think we're much more in the camp of redirecting and redistributing to encourage market growth, growth in users, and have that happen in a profitable way for both partners. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great, thanks. Good morning, Jon. Do you guys have any data to suggest you're attracting new consumers with all the sampling that you're doing, and how does that compare to your expectations? Are these consumers younger? Are they shopping more online versus brick-and-mortar, or are they fairly similar to your traditional consumer? And then just also, I'm not sure I heard it. But can you provide the price/mix volume breakdown between developed markets and emerging markets? Thank you. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: Sure. So I'm just looking for data here. If I look at volume sales price mix in developed, volume is plus 4%, sales plus 2%, price/mix minus 2%, for a net of plus 2%. That's obviously the all-in number, but organic volume plus 4%, sales plus 2%. In developing, organic volume plus 3%, sales plus 6%, and then \u2013 those are the major drivers of what's happening there. In terms of payout on sampling, I'm glad you asked that question. This is something that is typically \u2013 if you can sample consumers at point of market entry or point of market change with noticeably superior products in categories where brand loyalty is relatively higher, the lifetime benefit from that relatively modest investment can be significant, but it is a lifetime benefit. A consumer will take a period of time just to use the product that you've sampled them with. And so that's not an investment endeavor that we typically see immediate returns in. That's why, unfortunately, we got into a practice of reducing that spending because it wasn't producing \u2013 it never produces immediate short-term result. But it's really the area of spending that should be the last that we cut because of its importance in building users for potentially a lifetime of consumption. So we're happy with our efforts to date, but it's an area of return that we'll be monitoring and measuring for several years to come. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citigroup. Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi, good morning. Just to clarify, I think you called out another 1-point headwind on volumes this quarter from SKU reductions and minor brand divestitures and all that. Is that a number that's going to be in perpetuity, or do you have a time certain in mind that that headwind is going to end? And then secondly, if I'm looking at the Beauty business, and granted the 2% number is much better than we've seen, so that's great. But with Pantene up mid-single digits, and I know SK-II up strongly, I think that that implies that Olay is still really struggling. And maybe that's related to the first question, which is the SKU reductions that I know you've taken there. But what is the timeframe, do you think, for when Olay will return to growth mode? Thanks. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: In terms of the drag on the top line from portfolio focusing within the 10 categories, that is something that should start ramping down in the back half of this fiscal year. I expect it to continue, though, at some level through probably the first quarter, first two quarters of next fiscal year. But I don't think it's at a level during that period when we're likely to be talking about it; so still significant through the second quarter, reducing in significance sequentially from there. In terms of the Beauty business, we're very happy with how that's performing overall, as you said, plus 2%. I mentioned the sequential Hair Care acceleration that's occurred over the last 18 months or so. In the quarter, as you mentioned, Pantene was up mid-single digits. Head & Shoulders was up mid-single digits. SK-II was up strong double digits. Our Personal Care business is doing fairly well. Olay is stabilizing. We're going to annualize coming up here in the not too distant future the SKU cuts that we made in the U.S. We should annualize those in the back half. And we're just in the middle of redoing our entire counter system in China, and that includes some reductions in the number of counters to be more relevant in the channels that we want consumers shopping for Olay in and to have a better overall shopping and consumer experience. So I expect that those two items, the SKU reduction in the U.S. and the counter rationalization or redesign in China, will continue to put some pressure on Olay, call it through the balance of the fiscal. Operator : Next we'll go to Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, good morning, folks. Thank you for the question. Jon, you mentioned market growth range here from 1% to 7%, and hopes that you close the gap, tracking close to market growth by the end of the year. Can you give us a sense of what all-in that market growth looks like on a weighted average category/country basis? And then separately, even when we back out this 1 to 2-point benefit in China, the sequential improvement is notable, so congratulations on that. I was hoping you could expound a little bit more on the drivers of that improvement, whether it be channel driven, category driven. Just give us a little bit more color. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: Thanks, Jason. In terms of an aggregate market growth number, it's likely somewhere between 3% and 3.5%. I say likely because, as you know, that's a metric that lags, so I don't have data through September, for example. It's been declining modestly quarter to quarter, 6-month period to 6-month period, but I expect we're going to be somewhere in the 3% to 3.5% range overall. In terms of China, we've made some real progress on a couple important businesses and continue to do reasonably well in some others, with some work in the balance still to do. If we look at Oral Care, for example, in China it was up almost 15% on the quarter. That's driven by continued progress with the Oral-B brush as well as the high-end premium Oral-B paste that we launched a couple quarters ago. Shave Care, to the point of the question is there growth in Grooming, that remains up 17% on the quarter in China. Our Personal Care business is doing extremely well in China, as is SK-II, so that the entire Skin and Personal Care business was up about 10% in the quarter. Our biggest business in China, as you know, is our Hair Care business, which is a significant portion of the total. We continue to have four of the top leading brands in the market in Head & Shoulders, Rejoice, Pantene, and Vidal Sassoon. I think those are respectively number one, two, four, and five in the market. We're essentially flat there versus year ago, so we do have some \u2013 and part of that is driven by some new entrants into the market. One thing, but clearly it continues to be a strong business and offers some upside. The one business where we need to make much more progress is on Baby Care, which was down again double digits on the quarter. We feel very good about portions of our portfolio. Our pant offering, for example, is doing extremely well. We have some new premium taped innovation coming into the market in the next six to nine months, which we're also very excited about. But that is a business that we need to keep working on. In terms of channels in China, we're doing very well in e-commerce, growing ahead of the market, building share in e-commerce, still not yet to the level of our brick-and-mortars shares but improving significantly. We've stabilized and started growing shares in the hyper and super part of the business, which is encouraging. We still have some challenges both in the wholesale market and in building distribution in some of the specialty channels that are among the fastest growing. But as you rightly point out, overall real progress, and as I think about China long term, a significant opportunity on both the top and bottom line for the company. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC : Hey, thanks. Good morning, Jon. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: Good morning, Kevin. Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC : A quick housekeeping and then a broader question, so the housekeeping question, just because we've gotten a couple inquiries from investors this morning. The organic volume growth number was strong, albeit against a soft comp. Was there any timing benefit in the quarter or anything notable that you'd comment on with respect to retail inventory levels? And then the broader question, and I apologize if I missed this, what are the market growth assumptions contemplated in your outlook? And maybe you could separate the comments, Jon, into U.S., other developed markets, and then emerging markets. And I ask that in the context, we've seen some of your competitors talk about slowing market growth rates, particularly in Latin America. And maybe you could also comment on whether that outlook or those growth rate assumptions have changed over the past few months. Thank you. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: In terms of the organic volume and any timing impacts within that, not really. The biggest driver there is sell-through to consumption as well as the base period dynamic, which you rightly cited. There are certain categories where events are at different times and cross-quarters this year versus last year, but in aggregate that's not a significant driver of the volume progress that occurred. In terms of the market growth assumptions split developed and developing, this is like foreign exchange or commodities in that I don't know what the future holds. And so our forecast is predicated really on the equivalent of FX or commodity spot rates, which is just simply the latest data. And the latest data we have past three months shows market growth of a little over 1% in developed markets. That's inclusive of Western Europe, Japan, et cetera. And it shows 5% growth in developing markets. Weighted average together you get close to the 3% to 3.5% number that I was speaking with Jason about. If you look at the trend of those numbers, and I'm looking at sequential three-month periods, I really don't see a significant difference or a significant trend of change across those markets, so 0.1s and 0.2s, but nothing of significance. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello with Raymond James. Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, guys. Good morning. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: Hey, Joe. Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: I just wanted to focus on Fabric Care, if I could, this morning. I guess you guys mentioned in the press release organic sales in developed markets up high single digit. I guess first, how sustainable is that? I assume that number was similar in the U.S. And maybe if you can, compare that to what category growth was in the U.S. And maybe finally an update on competitive activity, particularly from Henkel in U.S. laundry \u2013 or sorry, in U.S. Fabric Care? Thanks. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: So starting with the aggregate number, as you know, organic sales in Fabric Care grew 5% in July \u2013 September. Within that, North America was up 7%, so we did build share of about 0.4 points on a past three-months basis in North America. The most important thing, though, in North America is the improvement in the rate of market growth, going back to our earlier conversations, up 4 points on a past three-month basis, driven by innovation in the category, which is exactly what we hoped to see. Also, growth within that segment is being fueled by our fabric enhancers business, the U.S. up 7 points versus last year with the scent beads segment, the one we're innovating in the most significantly, growing in the mid-20s; our fabric enhancer share up 1.5 points on a past three-month basis. We've withstood fairly successfully several competitive dynamics. We don't take that casually, though. But if we can continue to be an innovation leader in the market and moving the market, we believe we'll continue to be in a good position. Will the growth rate stay at that level? I would say likely not to that full extent in developed markets, but they'll continue to be attractive. On the other hand, what's implied deductively in those numbers is declines in developing markets. A lot of that is being driven by the portfolio, focusing efforts within Fabric Care, getting out of some of the lower-priced tiers, the bars, even powders in some markets. And so that's having an impact on growth from a negative standpoint, which should dissipate as we go forward. And so when you put those two things together, I would expect that Fabric Care will continue to be a strong contributor of growth at a total company level. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel, Nicolaus. Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks and good morning, guys. I wanted to ask a couple housekeeping questions. So China category growth, what is it in the markets in which you compete when your competitors are talking about just overall slowdown? I'm just trying to think about whether that's company or category specific. And then from an EPS algorithm standpoint for this year, what's embedded there from an input cost standpoint if you're starting to see things increase a bit there? Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: China market growth, when you look at the \u2013 first of all, it's very different by category, so let me start there. And most of the categories, based on the data that we have, are holding up fairly well. There's been a lot of conversation, for example, about diaper category market value growth. If I look past 12, 6, and 3 months, I see 12.0%, 11.0%, 12.0%. So I don't see a major change in the growth rate of that market, and obviously it's at a very attractive level. If I look at, for example, Feminine Care, again, fairly simple; it's fairly standard growth rates, Fabric Care 4.5%, 4.2%, 4.2%. Where you do see a significant reduction in the market growth rates in the tracked channel data is in some of the Beauty businesses, but I don't have all the data here in front of me. But that is largely driven by the movement of that business online. It's one of the disproportionate growers on e-commerce in China. And in aggregate, we still see relatively healthy market growth. In total call it 5% to 6% to 7%, without a significant change in that trend over the past 12 months. In terms of input costs, I said in the prepared remarks that the combination of FX and commodities was a $0.12 headwind to earnings per share. About 2/3 of that is coming from commodities. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole. Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC : Good morning, thank you. Looking, I think that the numbers you gave us on developed and developing market growth were volume up 4%, price down 2% in developed; and price up 3%, volume up 3% in developing. The question I would have is, as currencies stabilize, do you think there's less opportunity to get that 3 points of pricing in the developing markets? And so should we be actually a little more cautious on the pricing outlook moving forward? And then the other thing would be could you just talk about the biggest challenges to market share? I'm assuming it's Olay China and the U.S. and it's a couple of other big things. But if you could, just touch on that. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: I think you're right. To the extent that foreign exchange headwinds diminish, the pricing activity that we'll be engaging in, in developing markets would in all likelihood be lower. At the same time, though, that absence of price increase should lead to stronger volume growth over time. So I wouldn't necessarily look at developing market growth rates as inherently declining. But I think you're absolutely right that the components of that growth should be different. That's relative to price specifically. Relative to mix, I think you're still going to see some benefit there as major portions of the developing world move up the pricing ladder. The premiumization that we've seen in China, which is the largest developing market, is one example of that. And I expect that will occur in other markets as well as economies stabilize and improve. So net, I still am relatively bullish on our positions in developing markets and the growth prospects that they bring with them. In terms of market share losses, I mentioned the categories on a global aggregate basis where we're growing behind the market, and one of them is Hair Care. The other is Baby Care. And I also mentioned an opportunity in the U.S. Grooming market. We are on all of those. If you take Hair Care, for example, we're making great progress on Head & Shoulders, up 5 points in the quarter. We're making great progress on Pantene, up 5 points in the quarter. We have some issues, though, with some of our smaller brands, like Herbal Essences, for example, and we have a whole new program and a restage coming to market in the second half of the year. I mentioned some of the product work we're doing in Baby Care. And when we get that right, we tend to perform very well. If you look at the U.S., for example, where we do have that right, we're building market share both on Pampers and in aggregate. So as I mentioned, there's opportunity to improve. It's not something that will happen overnight, but it's clearly identified and being aggressively focused on. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge Research. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Good morning, thanks for the question. So it looks like as of last March, P&G had seen 17 consecutive quarters of negative foreign exchange effect, and it's a record (54:28) going back to 2000, but I don't know about before that. It's pretty extraordinary. In 15 of those 17 quarters, you took pricing, and now we've had two quarters in a row where you haven't, and absorbed a foreign exchange hit. Now that could just be coincidence, or I guess it could be an indication of a new direction broadly. But what I'd ask is first, could we \u2013 following on Caroline's question, can we expect, based on what you know right now, foreign exchange, would pricing be a component of the 2% \u2013 positive pricing be a component of the 2% organic sales target for this year, based on what you know right now? And when you think about value, as you mentioned in your remarks, can that include probably the highly likely benefits you get from gaining market share right now in developing markets, at a time when foreign currency is almost sure to turn around at some point? Is that included in the value equation when you compensate people when you manage these businesses? Thanks very much. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: There are real differences between, call it the last year and the years prior to that in the FX dynamics, which drive different decisions. You may recall, when we headed into the most recent round of big FX impacts, which was last year, we said that while historically we've been able to regain about 2/3 of the impact through pricing, we didn't feel we were going to be able to do that this time around. And that was driven in large part simply by a divergence in what was happening to the dollar and what was happening to the functional currencies for some of our significant competitors, namely the euro, the pound, and the yen. And those currencies were weakening over that period of time, and so there was less need for competitors who were reporting results in those currencies to price. And as much as anything, that's what you're seeing being reflected in the actuals. We're going to be pragmatic. We're going to offer a good value to consumers. But we're also going to work through every means we have available to us, including cost savings and mix improvement innovation to maintain attractive structural economics so that growth is worth something in these markets. And that's a different answer in every category and every market, month to month, week to week. So we're going to try to manage that as intelligently as we can. I wouldn't expect at this point, based on your point on where we sit today, do I expect pricing to be a significant part of the equation the balance of the year? I do not. In terms of how people are compensated, we are a U.S. dollar functional currency company. We pay dividends in dollars. We repurchase shares in dollars. And our investor base, as you well know, really doesn't care how many rubles we have or pesos we have. What they care about is how many dollars we have. And so the primary compensation lens is through all-in performance on dollar terms. We do, though, also have a look, because we don't want to incent behavior that's too short-term oriented, at constant currency. But over periods of time, we're going to measure our success or failure based on earnings per share and earnings growth and importantly, cash growth in dollars. Operator : And your final question comes from the line of Jon Andersen with William Blair. Jon R. Andersen - William Blair & Co. LLC: Good morning, thanks for the question. Hey, Jon, I just wanted to ask a little more broadly about two higher growth potential areas of your business. One is direct-to-consumer, and the second is green or environmentally sound or sustainable, whatever you'd like to call it. Are you happy or satisfied overall with the progress that the company is making here? And I know you have programs like Gillette Shave Club and products like Tide Pure Clean. Is this something that you can accomplish internally, be it internal focus or organic focus, or do you think you need to supplement or look to accelerate it with M&A as well? Thanks. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: Thanks, Jon. Let me address green and sustainable first. While we're open to both inorganic and organic ways of increasing our product superiority and the sustainability of our products, and that's an important 'and', it hasn't been our experience that there's a lot available on the market that delivers that 'and', which something like Tide Pure Clean definitely delivers. We've been on this for a while. While Tide Pure Clean is new, and is doing very well, if you look at share of the segment, it's done remarkably well in a short period of time. Things like Tide Cold Water, if you look at the entire energy consumption stream involved in washing clothes, there's more consumed in terms of energy to heat water than there is in the process of manufacturing and distributing detergent. So we're going to continue to look at all vectors that enable us to improve our sustainability across the value chain from a sustainability standpoint to have products that consumers can choose that enable them to improve their impact on the environment while still delivering against the need or the job to be done. So I don't think anything is required from an acquisition standpoint, but I also don't want you to think that we're not very open-minded in our pursuit of this objective, because we are. As it relates to DTC, this is an area I think that's important that we frame, first of all. Direct-to-consumer sales in our product categories globally currently represent 0.3% of sales. And it's not a reason \u2013 I'm not saying that to indicate that it's not a potentially important tool for us, I believe it is. And we've been going direct-to-consumer. Think about SK-II, as an example, for a period of time. There are opportunities for us to increase our relevance from a selling and brand building standpoint in a direct-to-consumer context across several of our categories, and we're mobilizing against those. And again, I don't want this to be taken the wrong way, but I don't see a mass move, call it 20% or 30% of the market, to direct-to-consumer consumption. If you just think about the experience of that, how many people do you really know that want to satisfy their household products shopping needs in a month or two by going to 40 different websites with 40 different passwords and 40 different packages that arrive at 40 different times? Again, I'm not in any way denigrating the opportunity that tool presents us and we need to fully capitalize on that, which we're working to do, but I did want to provide just a little bit of context. Operator : And, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: Thanks, everybody, and hope to see you here in November.",

P&G would like to remind you that today\u2019s discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G\u2019s most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the Company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from these projections. Also, as required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the Company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on the underlying growth trends of the business and has posted on its Investor Relations website, www.pginvestor.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP and other financial measures. Now, I will turn the call over to P&G\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller. Jon Moeller : Good morning. Our second quarter results keep us on track with our objectives for fiscal year 2017. Organic sales for the quarter grew 2%. This includes about a 1-point drag from the rationalization of the ongoing portfolio and reduced finished product sales to our Venezuelan subsidiaries. It also includes negative impacts from Indian demonetization and difficult operating environments in markets such as Nigeria, Egypt, Turkey and Argentina. Top line growth was broad-based. Organic sales improved in five of six regions, eleven of the 15 largest markets, all five reporting segments and in nine of ten product categories. In the U.S. our largest market organic sales grew 2%. Over the last three semesters, U.S. organic sales have progressed from up about half a point versus a year ago to up about 1.5 points to up more than 2 points. In China, our second largest market, organic sales growth has also progressed over the last three semesters and down 8% to down 2% to up 2.5% including 3% growth in the most recent quarter. We\u2019re making similar progress in each of our largest categories. Over the last three semesters, Fabric Care organic sales growth has progressed from up just less than 1% to 1.5% to 3% growth. Hair Care from down 1% to flat to up more than 2%. Baby Care from down more than two points to flat to up about half a point. And Grooming from up point and a half to up over 2 points in the two most recent semesters. Sales growth in the quarter was volume driven, organic volume was up 2%. Pricing and mix were each essentially neutral to our organic sales growth. All-in sales for the company were flat versus the prior year, including the 2-point headwind from foreign exchange. Moving to the bottom line, core earnings per share were $1.08, up 4% versus the prior year. Foreign exchange was a 5-point headwind on second quarter earnings growth about $0.05 per share worse than we expected heading into the quarter. On a constant currency basis, core earnings per share were up 9%. On a year-to-date basis constant currency core earnings per share growth is up double digits, extending the four year streak of high single or double digit constant currency core earnings per share growth. Core gross margin increased 70 basis points. On a constant currency basis, core gross margin was up 120 basis points, including 210 basis points of productivity improvement and a modest benefit from volume growth. Commodities mix and pricing were each a 30 point hurt to gross margin in the quarter. Core operating margin was inline with the prior year quarter. On a constant currency basis, core operating margin was up 60 basis points. Productivity improvements contributed 230 basis points of operating margin benefit. Core effective tax rate was 23.5%, essentially equal to the base period rate.  All-in GAAP earnings per share were $2.88 for the quarter, up 157% versus the prior year. This includes gain of $1.95 per share from the Beauty transaction with Coty that closed at the beginning of the quarter. We generated $2.4 billion of adjusted free cash flow. We have returned $12.7 billion to shares, $1.8 billion in dividends, $1.5 billion in share repurchase and $9.4 billion in share exchanges with the Beauty transaction. Despite some significant and unforeseen challenges, we stand at the halfway mark of our fiscal year essentially on track with where we hoped we would be. We are raising our guidance for fiscal year organic sales growth from around 2% to a range of plus 2% to 3% with the fourth quarter expected to be stronger than the third. We now expect fiscal 2017 all-in sales growth to be in line with the prior year. This includes a 2 to 3 point headwind from the combined impacts of foreign exchange and divestitures. We\u2019re maintaining for now our guidance for bottom line core earnings per share growth of mid single-digits. We continue to deal with an unprecedented amount of geopolitical disruption and uncertainty, which is affecting market growth, currency and commodities. We are not immune from these macro dynamics. We are aggressively driving cost savings to mitigate these impacts, but we\u2019re protecting investments in the business to accelerate organic sales growth in a sustainable long-term market constructive and value accretive way. Even if it means results end up below the current core earnings per share guidance range. We continue within our core of earnings per share estimates to reflect a reduction in fourth quarter non-operating income due to lower gains from minor brand divestitures. We now expect the core effective tax rate for the fiscal year to be slightly below last year\u2019s level. All-in GAAP earnings per share are forecast to increase by 48% to 50%, including the one-time gain from the Beauty transaction. At current rates and prices, FX is more than $0.5 billion headwind on fiscal 2017 earnings. Commodities are a $200 million headwind. Combined, they are about a $0.26 per share drag on fiscal 2017 core EPS. We\u2019re working to offset this, but are not yet completely there. Further significant currency weakness, commodity price increases, or additional geopolitical disruption are not anticipated within this guidance range. We expect adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% or better. As you know, fiscal 2017 is a year of significant value return to share owners. We expect to pay dividends of over $7 billion. We reduced outstanding shares by $9.4 billion in the transaction with Coty and we expect to purchase over $5 billion of our stock. In total, about $22 billion in dividend payments, share exchanges, and share repurchase this year. As David said, again at our Analyst Day, our objective is sustainably balanced growth and value creation. We discussed our focus areas in depth in our Analyst Day presentation, which is available on our Investor Relations website, so I won\u2019t elaborate on these again today. Instead I thought the balance of our time this morning could be most productively spent providing perspective on the most frequent conversation topics and questions we have been engaging with you on at and since the Analyst Day meeting. Top-line progress and prospects, retail trade transformation, naturals products and sustainability, cost structure progress and prospects, portfolio, foreign exchange impacts, and our management approach to them, capital structure and debt and the bundle of trade and tariffs and tax reform. I will take each of these one by one and then I will turn it over to you for additional questions. First how do we view our topline progress and longer term prospects. We stand modestly ahead of plan. We grew organic sales about a half point faster in each of the first two quarters than we were forecasting going in. We\u2019re making sequential progress and most of our top categories in markets and we\u2019re doing this despite some significant unexpected challenges. India demonetization, the elimination of 500, 1000 Rupee bank notes that accounted for over 80% of that country\u2019s currency in a cash dominated economy was an unexpected headwind. It was flowing high single-digits growth last quarter to a decline of high singles this quarter. Economic crises in Egypt and Nigeria are dramatically impacting category size; market contractions in Russia, Argentina, and Turkey pose real challenges and we\u2019ve had to manage the market impacts of politically-related currency devaluation in places like the UK and Mexico. Our organic topline for the first half of the year has been affected by the portfolio work we\u2019re doing in the ten ongoing categories and by loss sales to our Venezuelan subsidiaries. With all these challenges, we grew organic sales between 2% and 3% for the first half, putting us, as I said, modestly ahead of plan. This is very encouraging as our many elements looking forward. We\u2019re now a more focused ten category company, where purchase and intent in choice are driven by a specific job to be done and our products\u2019 effectiveness in doing it. These are predominantly daily use categories that matter to our retail partners. We said the new portfolio would grow up to a point faster and over the first two quarters of this fiscal year we\u2019re seeing that play out. We are increasing our investments in market-stimulating product innovation. We\u2019re continuing to improve and expand unit dose detergents. This premium price form has already past $2 billion in retail sales. We're currently building on this line-up, launching Tide PODS Plus Downy in North America. Our scent bead offerings including Downy Unstopables, Lenor, Gain Fireworks and Bounce are growing fast and are growing the fabric enhancer category. In the US, Downy Beads are growing in the mid-20%s and the category is up 7 points.  In Germany, where we launched Lenor Beads last summer, the fabric enhancer category is up 6% and our share is now over 50%. Our scent beads are available in 33 countries so far, including the recent launch in the Arabian Peninsula.  Always Discreet has increased market growth rates for female adult incontinence products by roughly 50% in the eight countries that we've launched so far. Last fall, we launched our new Pampers Easy Ups Training pants in US. Since the launch, segment growth is 16% and Pampers' share has increased by over 4 points.  We are strengthening investments and brand awareness and trial at the point of market entry and point of market change. 70% of new moms in the U.S. will receive samples of our best Pampers product through our prenatal and hospital programs. Gillette will sample over 2 million FlexBall ProShield razors with young men on their 18th birthdays. We will distribute over 30 million laundry detergent samples in new washing machines this fiscal year. We were connecting always with girls when they most need reassurance and self-confidence as they enter puberty and become new Feminine Care consumers. We're making organization changes to improve our execution, speed and responsiveness to local market dynamics. We are increasing our investment in sales resources to improve coverage of fast-growing channels, including eCommerce and specialty stores. We're adding salespeople with deep category experiences in categories like personal health care. And we're changing our talent development and career planning approach to build and reward applied category mastery.  In our larger markets, we are establishing direct end-to-end lines from each product categories straight through to our retail customer teams. In smaller countries that we manage as market clusters, we're implementing changes to give on the ground business leaders more flexibility to react quickly to competitive threats or customer opportunities.  We see a significant cost and cash productivity runway ahead of us, enabling us to keep funding smart market accretive growth opportunities. While we're not without our topline challenges, we're currently tracking ahead of plan and are raising our outlook for the year. So our next topic, you've been asking about is retail trade transformation and the impacts and opportunities for P&G. Our largest opportunity across channels of trade lies in creating and building indispensable brands and products of superior value, and in providing go-to-market experiences that are relevant and valuable to shoppers wherever they choose to shop.  If we do this well, we should have opportunity across channels and classes of trade. We don't currently envision and/or retail world, online or offline, mobile or desktop, subscription or a-la-carte. The mix along each of these continuums will vary by category, by country, by consumer and by occasion. We need to be relevant across this mix. One measure of relevance is market share. Our results vary by category and country, but on an aggregate basis, our online shares are currently equal to offline.  P& G eCommerce sales are now $3 billion. I was with David and the team last week in China. While we have more work to do, our eCommerce business there will reach 20% of sales and will exceed $1 billion this year. With an aggregate eCommerce share larger than the next three largest competitors in our categories combined.  In Korea, eCommerce is now 40% of our business. We're building a full toolkit of capabilities we can put to work where relevant. For diapers, subscription can provide convenience and increase loyalty. For SK-II super premium skin care, direct-to-consumer counseling either in-store or online can help inform the benefits of regimen usage. We're prototyping supply-chain capabilities to produce and deliver features at equal cost per unit to current batch production. We're positioning ourselves for relevance across channels and shopping preferences. We remain fully committed to our omni-channel retail partners and shoppers where most of the business remains and where we also see significant growth opportunities. Stores continue to hold strong relevance for many shoppers. For many shoppers, stores are more convenient, stopping at one location for multiple items. No packages left at the door; no passwords to manage. They can be more efficient for many shoppers groceries, gas, banking, and pharmacy, all in one stop. Stores can be cheaper, with no membership fees, or delivery charges and for some consumers, stores offer a social experience away from home or a break from out behind their desks. The important points are that we continue to create and build indispensable brands and products whose relevance extends across channels and are building the skills, capabilities and partnerships to win where average consumers choose to shop. The next question. Is there an opportunity for P&G to better serve the naturals consumer and the increasingly environmentally concerned shopper? There absolutely is. We introduced the first bio-based detergent with the cleaning power of Tide with Tide Pure Clean this past year. Pure Clean provides the cleaning power of Tide with 65% bio-based ingredients and is produced with a 100% renewable wind power electricity, in a facility operating with zero manufacturing waste to landfill. While it's still early days, Pure Clean holds a 7% share of the pure and naturals segment and is driving over a 150% of the naturals segment growth. We're just launching Herbal Essences with bio :renew, a revolutionary blend of antioxidants, aloe, and sea kelp that delivers an amazing product experience. The launch includes nine new collections, including styling products free of parabens, dyes, and gluten and an alcohol-free hair spray. We are launching new Febreze Air Effects that introduces a proprietary odor-fighting technology, delivered in a plastic can versus the previous aluminum packaging. The plastic can reduces the carbon footprint by 11% and results in a more efficient manufacturing process, using 15% less energy and reducing waste by 10%. On Charmin, we've added Forest Stewardship Council labels to let consumers know that 100% of our pulp is sourced from environmentally responsible forests. P&G is a sustainability leader in laundry and home care industry. We're the first multinational company to globally remove phosphates from all laundry and auto-dishwashing detergents without a compromise in cleaning. We're the first multinational company with 98% of this liquid laundry detergent compacted globally, with a dosage recommendation of 75 milligrams or lower. We're on track to reach 100% compaction in the near future. We believe one of the largest impacts we can make is enabling and educating consumers to use energy efficient laundry wash cycles. We\u2019ve set a target to have 70% of all machine wash loads completed in energy efficient wash cycles by 2020. We hope to get there with innovations like Tide HE Turbo Clean specifically designed for great performance in high-efficiency machines. Moving behind the scenes, our supply network transformation enables improvements in environmental sustainability as we move manufacturing and distribution closer to consumption. Since 2010, we\u2019ve reduced truck transportation commerce by more than 25%. Over the same time period, our plant size have reduced water use by 24% and increased our renewable energy use to 10% with a goal of 30% in the next four years. As we\u2019ve reported on our first-ever Citizenship Report published in December, we've recently achieved our 2020 goal of reducing energy use at P&G facilities by 20%, four years ahead of schedule. Recently, we set a goal for zero manufacturing waste to landfill from all production sites by 2020. These natural ingredient-based products and our industry-leading efforts to improve the environmental sustainability of our operations enable us to increase the relevance of our brands and products with the naturals consumer and the increasingly environmentally conscious shopper. Next, how are you feeling about your cost structure as it stands today and going forward? We feel very good about our current cost structure, having made significant progress over the past several years. And we have significant savings opportunities in front of us, which should enable us to invest in smart market-constructive financially accretive growth. We've talked about the historical progress before. We set a goal to save $10 billion over five years and then accelerated and exceeded each of our productivity objectives over that period. We reduced manufacturing enrollment on a same-site basis by 27 and on an all-in basis, including divestitures by 35%. We reduced overhead enrollment by nearly 25%, excluding divestitures and by about 35%, including divestitures. Net of re-investments and to innovation, sales coverage, media and sampling, productivity savings have enabled us to deliver constant currency gross and operating profit margin improvement at high single-digit to double-digit constant currency core earnings per share growth in each of the last four fiscal years. Over that same time period, constant currency earnings in our developing market grew 6 times faster than organic sales, significantly expanding local currency profit margins. On the balance sheet, we've improved inventory by around 10 days and payables by more than 30 days over the last five years. Our aggregate 22% core operating profit margin is the third highest in our industry. Only two companies in our primary competitive peer group have higher margins, Reckitt and Colgate, largely due to categories they compete in. Over the last three fiscal years, we've grown our top quintile operating margin by more than two points. What matters more than aggregate margin is the competitive comparison within each category. P&G's category gross margins are higher than competition by an average of about five points up to as many as 14 points. The comparison favors P&G in over three-quarters of the cases. Over the last four years, we've grown our aggregate gross margin by two points. We see similar advantages in core SG&A overhead. When we compare P&G's SG&A overhead costs to a competitive average, weighted by P&G's business mix by sector, our costs are more than 100 basis points lower than the competitive weighted average. Over last four years we\u2019ve reduced P&G's overhead costs, as a percentage of sales, by 50 basis points; over the next five years, we expect further improvement. Putting this together, at the operating margin level, P&G's operating margins are higher than competition or more than 70% of the category level comparisons. We have double-digit advantages in several and a notable gap in just one. We have further advantages in below-the-line costs. We borrow at some of the most favorable rates in our industry and have a tax rate that is among the industry's lowest. We are in an advantaged position but there is significant opportunity remaining to increase structural cost advantages and further improve cash efficiencies. We discussed many of these opportunities at our Analyst Day meeting, including the transformation of our supply chain and the digitization and automation of more of our work processes, both on and off the manufacturing floor. We will continue to improve productivity up and down the income statement and across the balance sheet, creating fuel to reinvest in smart value-accretive growth. The next question you've been asking is whether we are confident we will maximize value with the recently restructured Company. We believe we can create superior value with the new company that we've just created. We've been through significant portfolio valuation and reconstruction over the last two years. We've carefully and thoroughly evaluated each of our businesses for strategic merit, fit with our core capabilities, financial attractiveness, and historical track record of return. As we completed this thorough analysis, we felt several of the categories and more than half the brands have the potential to create more value in the hands of other companies, with stronger, more relevant capabilities in the categories in question, pet food with Mars, fragrances with Coty. We moved these categories out, removed all the stranded overhead and monetized the portion of the incremental value for our share owners. In the last few years, we've transitioned from a Company that competes in 16 product categories to one that competes in 10, or about 170 brands to 65. The businesses we exited represented about 14% of fiscal 2013 sales and only about 6% of our profit. Our new 10 category portfolio has historically grown 1 point faster and then 2 margin points more profitable than the old portfolio. So our affirmative response to value creation with the current company is not a function of our unwillingness to change or consider alternatives. The conviction comes from having done exactly that. It has only been one quarter, three months since we completed the majority of the portfolio moves but we're encouraged by path ahead of us. Another reason value creation is maximized with the new company are the synergies that exists in the new company portfolio, which are greater than the synergies that existed in the old portfolio. A number of the innovation platforms we are advancing have relevant and multiple of the 10 categories. The supply chain we are transforming is designed to synergize this portfolio with multi-category production and mixing centers. Most of the businesses we've divested, batteries, for example, or pet food, were self-contained from a manufacturing standpoint and had different patterns and endpoints of distribution. The mix of businesses we're moving forward with continues to facilitate highly synergized and cost-effective support functions and maintain scale purchasing advantages. For some businesses we chose to divest, we had a significant number of resources to provide the same level of support, a significant cost to synergy associated with the separation. The cost to synergy that completes separation will be massive. The operational dissynergy is extraordinarily complex. The tax implications will likely be very significant as would capital structure dissynergies, resulting in interest expense. To overcome these negatives and create more value as separate pieces, we would have to be comfortable believing in dramatically higher topline growth rates, more than just one point or two points over many years. At current rates of market growth, this would imply sustained growth above market rates. Having said all of that, our view to value creation will continue to be an extremely dynamic one. We're not led to the past simply because it is the past. We spent the last two years creating a new company, a new cost structure, a new portfolio. We're now creating the supply chain and the organization structure and culture that will allow us to drive, sustain, balance top and bottom line growth and are encouraged by the prospects. The next question. How do you think about FX and how do you respond to it? It might be helpful to briefly, very briefly recount how FX impacts reported earnings, or as you know, three impacts. First, exchange rates affect the local cost of imported finished products and raw materials. We attempt to recover these cost increases through pricing when local legal requirements and market realities allow it. What was a lag between when a currency devalues, the costs are incurred and the pricing is taken and executed through our channels of distribution. Second, we need to re-value transactional related foreign currency working capital balances at the end of every quarter at current spot rates. This includes a revaluation of working capital balances related to transactions between P&G legal entities that operate on different currencies. Balance sheet revaluation impacts are most pronounced when currencies make significant inter-quarter moves, such as the sharp devaluation of the Mexican Peso in November. Last, is income statement translation as a result of foreign subsidiaries that do not use the U.S. dollars or functional currency are translated back to U.S. dollars at the new exchange rates. Given the complexity of our global supply chain and the volatility of currency markets, the degree to which each of these impacts effects us in a given attributable can vary quite a bit. We've managed through more than $4 billion of accumulative FX impacts over the last four years, nearly half of fiscal year 2012 net earnings. Of this impact, about 30% was from transaction, 20% was from balance sheet revaluation, and the remaining 20% was from translation. At current rates, FX is more than $0.5 billion headwind to the current fiscal year, an increase of more than $300 million since our earnings last October. Our primary approach to mitigating the impact of FX movements is operational hedging. Where financially feasible, we try to denominate expenses in the same currencies in which we're selling products. One way to do this is with local manufacturing. As we localized manufacturing, more of our labor costs are denominated in local currency, more raw impacted materials are sourced in local currencies. There are limits, though, to localization benefits. It would not make financial or operational sense to build blades and razors plants in 120 companies \u2013 countries, for example. Many material inputs, such as pulp, lauric oils and the crude oil derivatives are globally denominated in dollars. About two-thirds of our global commodity spend is dollar-denominated. We're sometimes asked why we don't simply hedge away the remaining FX exposures. It's a good question and something we look at internally and with a different set of outside eyes every year as we prepare our financial plan. The three reasons we typically don't end up choosing to hedge the majority of the exposure. Up to two-thirds of our foreign exchange losses and a significant amount of our forward exposure is in currencies that are either non-deliverable or are very difficult to hedge. The Argentinian Peso, the Egyptian Pound, the Russian Ruble, Nigerian Naira are some examples. Second, hedging is neither free nor necessarily cheap. Currency volatility increases this cost. The last shortfall as having as the answer is it solves nothing longer term. It does nothing to help us restore the fundamental margin structure of a business. It simply defers volatility. While it takes time and there's a lag between the hurt and the help, we typically look to pricing, sizing, mix enhancement, sourcing choices and cost reduction to manage FX impacts. Russia provides a recent example. Two years ago, when the Ruble devalued we relax, we were left with negative gross margins across our portfolio of products, requiring us to take action. We initiated pricing and monitored consumer and competitive reaction, making adjustments where needed. Over an 18-month period, we took five pricing actions, resulting in a net 25% price increase across the portfolio. We made product sizing changes to ensure affordability with the pricing. Simultaneously, we aggressively reduced non-value-added costs, and worked to improve our product mix. Our operating approach is measured and practical. It is not defined by a fiscal year or a quarter. It often takes longer than that. We can't stand still but we also can't get out of balance. Next question. Are we considering any changes to our capital structure? Should we be more leveraged? We remain committed to strong cash returns for share owners as an important part of overall shareholder value creation. Over the last 10 fiscal years, P&G has returned over $123 billion to shareholders through dividends, share repurchase, and share exchanges. We've returned 100% of net earnings over those 10 years. We have paid a dividend for 126 consecutive years, and we've increase the dividend from 60 consecutive years. Our dividend payout is over 70% of net earnings compared to a U.S. peer group average of about 54%. Our dividend yield is currently over 3%, a four point higher than the S&P 500 average. At the start of the fiscal year, last fiscal year, we forecasted that we would return up to $70 billion in dividends, share exchange and share repurchase over four years through fiscal 2019. With $15 billion returned last fiscal and about $22 billion projected for this year, we are making good progress towards that goal. We believe we are in a good spot, with our AA minus credit rating and should retain it, particularly as interest costs are poised to increase and as potential tax reform creates uncertainty about future deductibility of interest expense. We're financing around $30 billion in debt at an average interest rate below 1.6%. Commercial paper makes up about one-third of our debt portfolio. We've been able to access the CP market in several European companies at negative interest rates. Overall, we are borrowing at 70 to 80 basis points below 10-year treasury rates and below 5-year rates. We are among the \u2013 these are among the lowest rates in our industry. A downgrade would provide additional leverage that could be used to purchase more shares or to issue a special dividend. This will obviously be a one-time benefit. It\u2019s not a recurring source of cash. Additional debt service, an increase in the cost of debt service and a less efficient mix of debt, with lower CP capacity, essentially overset \u2013 offset over time the modest cash return benefit. Finally, we received a number of questions about potential impacts from U.S. policy changes related to trade barriers, tariffs, and tax reform. While we certainly appreciate the appropriateness of these questions, we are guessing and right along with you on what the impacts may or may not be on our business. That said, there are few facts that might be helpful. P&G produces 85% of the products themselves in the U.S. domestically, and we export about 10%. So a net import balance of only about 5% of U.S. sales. The majority of the small amount of imported product is produced in Canada. We estimate that over 90% of the materials we use to manufacture products in the U.S. are sourced domestically. Material imports occur primarily in the case of insufficient U.S. supply.  From our experience in many other markets, local supply constraints are usually taken into account as governments consider tariffs or other border adjustments. As always in tax and trade, the details matter very much, not just the headline rates and rules. As more details are known, we will update you on how they will affect our business. Now wrapping up, as I said before, we leave the second quarter essentially on track to deliver our fiscal year objectives, despite unforeseen significant setbacks. We're increasing topline guidance. We're continuing our work to crawl out from under additional FX hurts and we remain on plan to return about $22 billion to shareowners through a combination of dividends, share repurchase, and share exchange. Hopefully, you found this question-guided discussion a helpful one. I'll now be happy to take any additional questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citi. Wendy Nicholson : Hi, good morning. My question has to do actually with the hair care business specifically because I know last year CAGNY that was an area where you cited particularly robust innovation pipeline and all that. But the U.S. market share data has not been good in recent months. So when you called out that as a category that has been particularly strong. It has accelerated, can you explain where that\u2019s coming from is it that the U.S. isn\u2019t accurately reflecting what you are seeing, because there have been any pipeline sale, is it international market, is it non-track channels. And what\u2019s the sustainability do you think of the strength in hair care given how competitive that category is? Thanks. Jon Moeller : Thank you, Wendy. The strength in the U.S. is primarily behind Heads & Shoulders and Pantene both of which are doing very well. We are not doing so well on the balance of the portfolio, the smaller brands particularly Herbal Essence. We are just as we speak relaunching Herbal Essence. And I talked earlier in our prepared remarks about the naturals based focus of that launch and we're very excited about that. So part of the dynamic here has been different growth rates across the brands. But we are again relaunching Herbal Essence as we speak. Across markets we continued to do well in markets like China. Hair care has done very well in Latin America. So there's also a geographic dynamic that's driving the overall aggregate result. You mentioned non-track channels. That's a significant impact and is going to be increasingly frustrating for this community I think. If you look at the U.S. on an aggregate P&G basis, I don't have the data with me for just hair care. But if you look at all of our categories, there is about 1.4 difference or 1.4% that explains the difference between reported growth rates and something like Nielsen and our growth rates that we're reporting through our earnings release. That increase is dramatically when you go to a market like China where that delta is up to six points. So that\u2019s also one of the drivers. And we are doing relatively well from a hair care standpoint online. I think the program. I know the program strengthens going forward. We're bringing new initiatives to market not just on Herbal Essence but on Pantene and Heads & Shoulders across geographies. So we feel reasonably good about the sustainability of the growth that we've been delivering more recently. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : Hey, good morning. So I want to focus on organic sales. First the full year organic sales growth guidance raise is that more due to upside from the first half of the year that you already reported or you also more optimistic about the second half that it should be better than what you originally expected. And does the first half outperformance give you greater confidential and the year growing in line with the categories you previously articulated. And then to the last question, you mentioned the gap between on track and track channels. In the U.S. it looks like it was a couple of hundred basis points in the quarter. So I just want to get more specifics particularly in the U.S. across your business. Is that just that on track channels have really accelerated or the things like shipment timing in there? And do you think it\u2019s true for the industry or is it more of a P&G phenomenon? Jon Moeller : The answer for your first three or four questions is yes. So we did do better in the first half than we expected we would. So we're at about 2.5% through the first six months and we expect to improve that. Modestly as we go through the back of the year. So, yes it reflects progress to-date, yes, it reflects our confidence in the back half, and yes, we would expect we hope to get close to market growth rates as we exit the year. As I\u2019ve said in our prepared remarks, we expect the fourth quarter to be stronger than the third quarter. There was always the swampy straight line but the answer broadly is yes. In terms of other things besides the non-track channel dynamic, driving differences between what you\u2019re seeing in our reported sales numbers and the market base numbers. There are always puts and calls in different markets. For example, in China, Chinese New Year fell very early this year. And so there were some part of the normal inventory load that occurs ahead of the Chinese New Year holiday but this year occurred in December. Last year it would have occurred in January or February, I can\u2019t remember exactly when the holiday was last year. So there are those dynamics but broadly I think you can look at the 2% on the quarter is a pretty good number representative of the general strength of the business. It might be just a tad high because of dynamics like the Chinese New Year timing and different year-to-year promotional items but there\u2019s nothing very significant or concerning within that. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj : Hi, guys. I have a question on SG&A and a question on just pricing. Suppress me with the second one, it was clearly flat to down everywhere and below FX, although you keep saying you want to offset FX and I want to understand whether that kind of the strategy or really just a determination of a weak consumer. And I ask that I guess in the context of is the plan to grow really from market share versus category growth, we\u2019ve all seen the Nielson numbers, for example, slow down, but on a global basis. That\u2019s question one. The other one on margins, really, as I totally guess the gross margin of 210 basis points of productivity, I think that's great. I want to understand does that continue. So should we expect 200 basis points of improvement in our gross margin from productivity and for how long? So is that sustainable? And then on SG&A specifically, only 20 basis of productivity; I frankly have a tough time with the benchmarking numbers. You're putting up there saying you're actually better than peers without including scale and everything else. But you're 20 basis point seems a little low and I want to get a sense of whether you should expect that to ramp up. And then the 80 basis points reinvestment, how much of that is sampling versus actual kind of advertising expense increase? Thanks. Jon Moeller : All right. I can't really \u2013 can't possibly answer all of those questions, but I'll take a shot at the big ones within that. In terms of pricing, when we look at pricing, inclusive of promotion, as a component of our top line growth that was neutral on the quarter. It's been neutral to positive for the past 24 quarters consecutively. It has been positive for the last 12 years. So as relates to the promotion part of the question or potential part of the question, as I've said many times, we will be competitive on promotion, but it is not something that we typically lead with. We would rather spend a dollar on innovation or equity when we have that opportunity. In terms of the flat pricing in the quarter and its vis-\u00e0-vis FX increases; I mentioned when I was talking about FX that there's often a significant lag between when the FX hits us and when we're able to take smart pricing. And if you think about what's happened in the FX markets over the last, call it, six quarters; most of the increase that we're talking about \u2013 we talked about $500 million of FX impact versus year ago. I mentioned that $300 million of that has occurred since we reported earnings on October. So the pricing environment that exists in the market now is reflective of a more neutral FX environment and we'll have to see what happens going forward. We are very cognizant that with a broad dollar move against most currencies that our pricing flexibility will be somewhat limited or will be less than it might otherwise have been. Nonetheless, it will continue to be part of the strategy, but they'll be a bigger component of cost reduction, mix management, sizing et cetera. As relates to margin, I think the gross \u2013 and I honestly don't have in my head the exact gross margin numbers quarter-by-quarter, I just don't think about things that way. But the general order of magnitude you've seen is representative of the strength of the productivity program. That's going to differ quarter-by-quarter depending on commodity impacts, depending on how much volume we ship. But generally I expect to see a healthy gross margin contribution as we go forward. Recall, we mentioned that our next $10 billion productivity program, the majority of that would be in cost of goods, which is part of the reason why you see a divergence between the gross margin benefit from productivity and the SG&A benefit. 20 points a quarter on SG&A, I\u2019ll take that, make time. We obviously have more opportunity ahead of us as I said and we'll see how that progresses. At the same time we've talked about reinvesting in things like sales coverage which we are doing. And that is also reflected in the overall numbers. I think I\u2019ll leave it there and feel free to get back to me later in the day Ali, if I missed an important part. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Great, thanks. I'm going to actually try to ask one question, not seven. I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about innovation. I thought one of the things I picked up at the Analyst Day around that Tide Pure Clean that was really interesting was the notion of lean innovation, and try to move a lot faster, and bringing things to market in particularly things that are going to be increasingly consumer relevant. So can you talk if there are other examples of where you are already putting that lean innovation mindset to work or if that's still very much on the calm? And then any other kind of notable news flow that we should be looking for in the next couple of months. Thanks. Jon Moeller : Thank you, Lauren. Lean innovation is in its early days in terms of both learning and implementation. It offers significant opportunity for the reasons you describe, quick learning, quick response, lower cost learning, more shots on goal. I was just in a meeting for a couple of hours yesterday afternoon with some of the leadership team on lean innovation. And some of the pilot programs we were applying in that to try to improve, again, both the cost profile, the speed to market, and the number of ideas that we\u2019re screening. So we're very excited about the potential it holds, but it's early days. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with UBS. Steve Powers : Great, thanks. Hi, Jon. Just going back to sort of the demand building efforts that you've been making, I was just hoping if you could frame and quantify the magnitude of the year-over-year increases in demand building this quarter, and I'm thinking across trade, spend, A&P sampling, both a little gamut relative to the run rate looking backwards over the course of fiscal 2016 in Q1 versus where you think that trends going forward. I'm trying to figure out if we're at a relatively steady year-over-year increase or if we're poised to accelerate further or decelerate that kind of thing. Thank you. Jon Moeller : Sure, Steve. With pride and we've talked about this a couple of times too both ensure that our demand creation efforts are sufficient and that they are sustained. One of the problems that we created in the past was a fair degree of volatility and support levels for the business. And that's why I made the remarks that I made when I was talking about the bottom line guidance in the context of FX that we're simply not going to make those choices. We're going to continue to support the business in a sustained fashion through the balance of this year, through the balance of next year. Our support levels are pretty ratable quarter-by-quarter throughout this fiscal year. I don't have all the base period numbers exactly in my head, so I'm not sure what all the index comparisons would be. But I think what you've seen is symptomatic of what you will see going forward. It's not just though the marketing and trade spending that we're viewing as investments in demand creation, it's also the investments in capability which comes in several forms. We've talked coverage which we're investing in. We've talked about category mastery, both building and hiring and from the outside, we've been doing that. We've talked about category dedication. We've talked about increasing the flexibility of our operations to respond to changes, whether there are changes in opportunities, whether they\u2019re competitive, trade initiated or otherwise. And so all of this were hopeful has an impact on demand creation. All of us this were hopeful as market accretive in its approach. And we still have a lot to prove, we still have a lot of work to do. But so far it's progressing in the direction that we had hoped. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Nik Modi : Thanks. Good morning everyone. Jon, can you just give us an update on in-store execution. I know about something that we talked about at the Analyst Day and kind of some of initiatives we're putting in place to really make sure you get the right assortment merchandising, limit out of stocks et cetera. And has ever been a discussion internally at P&G regarding moving perhaps the P&L responsibility to the customer teams versus the category or the geographic level? Thanks. Jon Moeller : Thank you, Nik. I mean clearly in-store execution is another important element going back to Steve's question on sufficient demand creation, significant number of consumer choices on brand and product are made at that shelf. So having the products available, having them be presented in an understandable and compelling way, that\u2019s all incredibly important. A couple of things here; one, we are whole supply chain transformation. You're familiar with I think the fact that we now are operating these Mexican centers in the U.S., which is designed to get us closer to consumption and are designed to reduce auto stocks. We have significantly improved auto stock levels across our customer base through that, so we\u2019re very happy about that. And this is an initiative that is going to be rolling globally in markets is appropriate. So we expect to continue to improve that. It\u2019s very important. We\u2019ve also tried to get clear and clear alignment between our brand teams and our sales teams on what are the drivers of both market growth and brand growth in an in-store context. And then frame the tree programs and our execution in store against those drivers, key business drivers and be very focused and really, really, one or the two or three drivers that matter most. That we\u2019re measuring performance against a combination of those drivers, which are different by category was that delivered in-store and gross margin or gross contribution. So there is an element of profit responsibility and profit consideration that is occurring all the way down through to sales professional in the store. And this is an area I frankly think we have a lot of upside in. There is some great work going on around the world and it\u2019s a clear driver of our business. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Olivia Tong : Hey, thanks. Just wondering if you could talk a little bit about some of things that you are seeing from the key things you are thing that give you the components to raise the organic sales outlook because that to back pretty far to see the last time you guys did that. And is it more function of the category is getting better or that your execution is improving to because it was look like all care to category seems to be getting better. But then some of the source parts in your product grouping there is still some challenges at we\u2019re seeing there like in diapers. Thanks. Jon Moeller : Thank you. In general on an aggregate basis category growth continues to decline at a very modest level, but it is declining. Some of that is developing market dynamics associated with some of the big currency moves. The U.S. is essentially, it is very \u2013 it\u2019s pretty stable, may be a slight uptick here or there. So the majority of the progress that has been made is really execution and very little that, in fact I would have to look at specific good numbers, but I would expect that the category growth driver of our growth as a negative in the whole equation, modest negative but a negative. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello with Raymond James. Joe Altobello : Hey guys, good morning. I just want to stay on the concept of demand creation for a second and the increase investment you guys are doing and things like sampling and salves coverages. I was just curious in terms of a more broader question the trend that you\u2019re seeing in the overall cost to acquire a customer and to keep that customer versus where it was a five years ago. Thanks. Jon Moeller : There are actually more options available to us to attract customers to our brand and more tools than there probably were five years ago, so done right. There\u2019s no reason that the cost of acquisition of a customer should be hire today than it was five years ago. Having said that, there\u2019s a lot more complexity in the shopping environment, in the media environment and done wrong, you can\u2019t increase pretty significantly and efficiencies in the cost of customer acquisition. I really can\u2019t give you a more specific answer than that Joe, but I don\u2019t see customer acquisition cost has been significantly increased or inflated as we go forward. We can reach consumers and shoppers today and much richer, more direct ways than we ever could. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : Good morning. First one Jon housekeeping question, I don\u2019t believe you gave it. I apologies if you did. Can you provide global category growth and maybe separate that by EM and DM. And then the second piece I wanted to come back to a comment you made and we\u2019ve touched on a lot of these topics, but just to sort of underscore the importance here. You talked about long-term investment, even if it means P&G\u2019s results and the below the current guidance of mid-single digit core constant currency. And that sounded new to me and you tend to be very joyful about the language that you use. So is it just a matter of the stronger dollar and less ability to take pricing, is just a matter of promotion ramping maybe a bit more than anticipated. I just want to kind of come back to that and maybe underscore some of the key drivers behind that comment, thanks. Jon Moeller : Thank you, Kevin. We talked about this both last year and this and we\u2019ve done it. We talk about in the context of FX, which is what\u2019s relevant again this year. We need to support our businesses in a sustainable sufficient way and we\u2019re going to do that. The challenge of doing that and delivering and EPS number and the current environment is almost entirely FX. It is not \u2013 of course there are examples by category what promotion levels of increased or by country work promotion levels of increase, but on a broad scale basis as we look over the total business. That\u2019s not the driver of the challenge from a profitability standpoint it is FX and commodities and I talked about $500 million of FX, $300 million of which has just come on since October and about $200 million worth of commodity costs. We\u2019re committed to work as hard as we can to offset that making smart choices on cost and ideally continuing to push the top line as well. What we\u2019re not going to do is reduce investment that\u2019s working to drive growth just to deliver a near-term quarterly number. So that\u2019s all we\u2019re saying. And I think that that is maybe inconsistent in totality with our past. I think it\u2019s very consistent with the last couple of years how we\u2019ve been approaching the business. In terms of market growth, developed market growth is about 1% overall, developing is about 5%, not a significant change in either versus the prior quarter that yields about 3% global growth, there obviously significant differences by country, but that\u2019s the aggregate look at that. Operator : Our next question comes from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank. Bill Schmitz : Hey Jon, good morning. Can you just like add more detail to the delta on the commodity in FX inflation because I think it was $0.12 before and it\u2019s $0.26 now? So you kept guidance obviously, I guess sales are modestly up. So can you just talk specifically how you even try to make up for that gap? And then can you just talk about to the category that stood out good and bad. So like the overall care business obviously came in way better. Was that market share gains or was that acceleration in category growth and then just very briefly in diapers, you talked about higher promotional spending. What is the strategic rationale for that, because I know you\u2019ve talked pretty extensively about promotions being sort of like short-term fix and not a long-term your brand equity driver, thanks. Jon Moeller : Thank you, Bill. The strategic rationale for the increase in production at diaper category is competitive response. I\u2019ll just leave that there. In terms of Oral Care, we\u2019re making very good progress on both our paste business, but also on our more high end brush business, the automatic power brushing. And that\u2019s growing extremely well in markets like the U.S., but also in markets like China. In terms of the breakdown of FX, I mean you talked about 12 points going to 26 points about three quarters of that occurred since October and it\u2019s across currencies. If I were to show you a graph today of currencies that are down and up. I\u2019m sure you have one sitting on your desk, as it is they\u2019re all there\u2019s been a significant move that\u2019s occurred. And as I said earlier it\u2019s different by category by country. But we\u2019re going to try to recover that yet through a combination of price increases whether relevant, size and changes, mixed cost. And there really isn't one answer. I apologize, but that gives you an aggregate feel for how that happens. It's markedly different by market by currency. And one of the big differences is a yuan or euro functional currency competitor impacted by the valuation in a specific market or not. Another variable is, what\u2019s happening to local inflation and how our local competitors cost structure is being impacted by what\u2019s happened. And they have a reason to price or not. Another factor is where are we, in terms of category leadership or followership are we the number one brand or we the number three brand. That has an impact. So it is a very granular gain and a very executional gain but one that we frankly despite issues within a given quarter, I\u2019ve done generally fairly well at over the last four years offsetting the $4 billion of affects, nobody likes the $3.80 or whatever the EPS number is the people feel were stuck on. But it could've been a whole lot worse. And we\u2019ve done I think a very good job of managing that, and Kevin, I towards managing these in more effectively from a growth standpoint on the topline as we go forward. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Bill Chappell : Good morning, thanks. Jon, taking to step back, maybe you could give us little bit more in the genesis of this call I mean it's a different format and kind of walking through the Q&A, it\u2019s earlier I think this is the earliest you\u2019ve ever reported at least that I can remember in terms of since the quarter close and ahead of some of your competitors and you obviously had a message you want to get out there. So, are you frustrated with the stock price? Do you not feel like people understand what\u2019s going on with P&G after the Analyst Day or there just key issues that you wanted to get out, I mean, just little more color would be great, that was kind of a surprise, obviously to see reporting this early and kind of going through this format. Jon Moeller : Sure, sure, sure. This was a fairly clean quarter for us and it's obviously not a year end quarter. So we were able to get our accounts together and fairly short order. And having an earlier call, frankly, allowed me to take advantage of scheduling an opportunities next week and it\u2019s simplest that. In terms of the format, I just didn\u2019t thank you while that go through the Analyst Day, March again, since that was about available for you online. And that's essentially the format we\u2019ve used before us to walk-through productivity walk-through portfolio, walk-through topline. I thought I would just diversify a bit and make sure all of the ground was hopefully, helpfully covered for you and that's all there was for that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy with CLSA. Caroline Levy : Good morning, Jon. Thank you so much. As always, I\u2019m very interested in what's going on in China with particular interest in whether the heavy discounting in the diaper category has continued. And if you expect that to mitigate at any point, who has the consumer become used to 20% lower pricing. The other area in China would be detergents, where you\u2019ve had some strong local competition and Oral Care, where you\u2019ve had strong local competition, because just bring us up to date on that that would be helpful. Jon Moeller : I want to step back in China first and then I\u2019ll get to your specific questions. I think it's very important that we understand that China continues to be a very attractive opportunity. This is a market that is among the highest growth rates across the world on a sustained basis and that really hasn\u2019t changed. It\u2019s a market that as we've talked before, premiumizing significantly customers are trading up to better performing products across categories. As we move out of the one trial policy, there\u2019s certainly only upside that exist there, as the economy transitions from more of a manufacturing based company to \u2013 economy to a degree of a more consumption-based economy. That\u2019s significant upside and we have a market position there and capabilities that, that allows us to take advantage and participate in all of those upsides. So China continues to be \u2013 as you know it's our second largest market both in terms of sales and profits. So it\u2019s also a big focus area for us. I mentioned on the call that David and I were there last week. No better way to start the New Year than to go to China. And the business is responding fairly well overall. We went from minus 8% quarter\u2019s not very long goal to the quarter we just completed plus 3%, first half was plus 2.5%. Obviously we still have some work to do, because our markets are growing depending on the category mid-singles. In terms of specific categories Oral Care, we're doing fairly well and that\u2019s being driven primarily by power brush and by our Oral-B pastes launch a very premium dual phase product that\u2019s doing very well. It is a limited distribution, but that distribution is going to be expanding as that has proven out. We do see continued promotion in the diaper category, but it's important to note that at the same time that that\u2019s happening, that\u2019s really a competitive driven dynamic. At the same time that's happening, consumers are continuing to trade up to premium tiers. And that is by far the fastest growing segment of the market. So the notion that consumers in China have become if you will price-sensitive, that\u2019s certainly not what we're seeing. This is a competitive dynamic that reflects in some ways the size of the opportunity that reflects in some ways changes in frankly, currency rates and regulation. But it is not something I would expect categorize the category for extended periods of time. And we certainly \u2013 it\u2019s certainly not a reflection of a desire for lower price on the part of the Chinese consumers, who is very focused on product quality and product performance. Detergents, our Ariel liquids lunch is about on a target with where we expected it to be. We do have as you mentioned very good, strong, local competition, but we also have two very good and strong brands on Tide and Ariel and continue to work to build that business. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge Research. Jonathan Feeney : Thanks very much, Jon. Just one question on Fabric Care. There\u2019s been a significant competitive entrant to reentrant into North American Fabric Care. And I think a lot of people have been wondering what implication that might have, when you think about maybe Fabric Care globally pricing little down and then significantly down relative to our currency. Just kind of trying to understand, what's going on? First of all, how North America \u2013 what North America pricing looks like the comment on that. If competitive entry there, or any place else is \u2013 you just mentioned China but it\u2019s having an impact. Thank you. Jon Moeller : The pricing environment in the U.S. market for detergents has become more competitive over the last quarter or two. As a result, you\u2019ve seen market growth rates go from positive to slightly negative. And that's being driven as much by anticipation on the part of competitors as to what the new entrant is going to do. Then it is anything else. And we'll see how that plays out. We\u2019re \u2013 in terms of how that strategy \u2013 how Henkel strategy is going to play out, it's way too early for us to know that. Our best play continues to be to strengthen our brands both from a product efficacy standpoint and a consumer delayed standpoint, which we continue to do. Operator : Next we go to Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Bonnie Herzog : Hi, Jon, good morning. Jon Moeller : Good morning. Bonnie Herzog : In light of the tough competitive environment in many of your key categories, how much further pricing promotion do you think is needed to drive share. And then you\u2019ve talked in the past about getting your price ladders right in your different categories. So I\u2019d be curious to what percentage if your business now has the right price ladders in place versus what percentage still needs to be treat. And then maybe highlight, which categories might need the most work. Thank you. Jon Moeller : Sure Bonnie. I'm limited in what I can say about future pricing directions legally. But I can talk about current status in general strategy, which I'm happy to do. The majority of our portfolio whether that\u2019s defined by category or by a market is where we feel we need to be from a price ladder standpoint. There are clearly some categories, a couple of categories where we have opportunities. And again, I really don\u2019t want to name categories, but I bet even I \u2013 if I wrote them on two separate piece of paper we\u2019d find some of the same names. Those are factored into our plans that we have articulated today, we will be competitive on price. But again, we\u2019re not going to lead with promotion as a way to grow market share. I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s a sustainable way to grow our market share because there\u2019s absolutely nothing proprietary about it. It can be repeated in a nanosecond, which is matched \u2013 which is very different than either cutting edge innovation or idea inspired equity building. So there will be a mix but we will be competitive. We\u2019re generally where we need to be but not in every category country combination. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jon Andersen with William Blair. Jon Andersen : Thanks. Hi, Jon. I had a question on kind of multi-channel discussion you outlined earlier. You mentioned that the company\u2019s aggregate online share is comparable or equal to its offline share. I\u2019m wondering if there are any specific markets or categories, one or two where that that is in the case and you think there is more work to be done. But you could talk a little bit about those and what your intentions are there. Thanks. Jon Moeller : Probably, the primary example of where we have more work to do that matters from a size standpoint is China. In aggregate, our online shares in China are below our offline shares. We\u2019re making a lot of progress though. I mentioned $1 billion in sales in online this year not 20% of our business, that business \u2013 the online business is growing at 30%, 40%, 50% clip depending on the month of the quarter. And we are building share. Our online share is growing. It is not yet though to the same level as our offline shares. And that\u2019s probably the biggest example of where that\u2019s the case. And in some other markets, we\u2019re over developed from an online standpoint. And again it differs dramatically by category. You can appreciate that categories like power brush, like our electric shaving business, some of the \u2013 certainly the diaper business are very well-developed online and some of the others a little bit less so. But if we were to get and I expect we will get China to market share equivalents online versus offline. The aggregate statement I would be making them is that our online shares are higher than our offline shares. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel, Nicolaus. Mark Astrachan : Yes, thanks. Good morning everyone. I wanted to follow-up on the commentary on the omni-channel and wanted to be where consumers shop. So just curious, has there been a change in discussions around pricing and maybe broader product support for your brands giving increasing challenges faced by those traditional retailers and assuming need for greater reinvestment to drive the traffic. I mean, any sort of commentary on last couple of years, last six months, whatever it is that you\u2019ve seen \u2013 that you could talk about, it would be helpful. Jon Moeller : Everyone, whether they\u2019re an online retailer or an offline retailer is participating in the race to drive traffic to their specific channel or chain. The biggest help we can give any retailer whether online or offline are indispensable brands that consumers need and want. That is by far the biggest driver of traffic for them. And creating offerings instead a relevant for their shopper, which may be different across channels. If we have products that are not irresistibly superior and don\u2019t delay consumers, the notion that we\u2019re going to drive store traffic on those items with a lower prices is a hard one to get comfortable with. So we\u2019re really focused in our discussions with our retail partners on driving their market basket and market growth through better performing brands that ideally are indispensable to consumers. We\u2019re also very focused with them on making our joint operations as cost efficient as possible, which gives them inherently more pricing flexibility or marketing flexibility than they would have otherwise have. And that\u2019s a big part, certainly not all of the part, but a big part of our approach on supply chain transformation has been designed inherently with this customer enabling focus in mind and reducing their costs as well as our costs, increasing shelf presence in terms of availability, which helps both us and them. So that is by far the majority of the conversation. Operator : And sir, your final question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Hey, good morning folks. Thank you for squeezing me into here. Congratulations on another relatively solid quarter especially the progress in the U.S. Its boost to aggregate topline is apparent; I presume this is also an important driver of why mix from a gross margin headwind is abating. So my question is really around sustainability of the U.S. We talked a few times throughout the quarter about the deviation in terms of reported results from what we can see in our data. But from what we see in the data it is kind of concerning. Overall sales eroding but reported sales sort of accelerating and despite a lot of your comments Jon on promotions and not wanting to lean too heavily it looks like you are leaning really heavily on it. In the data and sort of underlying non-promoter base sales eroding even further. So the data sort of raises questions of whether we have a bit of a transitory disconnect between the data and results, which we see from time-to-time, which usually rever or whether this is now just really different if we had step changes sort of on measured contribution that its going to keep this delta widening on the forward. Can you give us some more color on that and give us a little more reason to sort of not believe the data we\u2019re seeing the consumption. Jon Moeller : I\u2019d say a couple of things, Jason. If I step way back and look at for example strength of program, front half, back half, I talked about that previously, I don\u2019t see a big change there. Innovation improves and increases in the back half in the U.S. We\u2019re increasingly getting the coverage patterns that we want to have in place with the talent and deep category mastery in place across the U.S. So I don\u2019t see anything at an aggregate level that says that U.S. sales should decelerate. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me in a given quarter that instead of being plus two, it\u2019s plus one \u2013 that\u2019s kind of the range that which I am looking. There are categories in the U.S. where promotion intensity has increased significantly. And what I am not saying is that, we\u2019re not participated into them. We need to be competitive, I\u2019ve said that several times on this call and we will be competitive. What we won\u2019t typically do is lead promotions spending. There are also times when certain competitors for a very good reasons, we will take a list price decline. And our most efficient response may be at time as for a period of time to increase promotion to get to the right price spread versus our competitor. So well that tactically looks like a differential increase in promotion. It\u2019s all about getting to a net price. Again, us being responsive to what our competitors offer. So happy to talk that more with you later day Jason, that\u2019s helpful. John and I will be around the balance of the day. Thank you for your time. And hope to see most of you here in a couple weeks at CAGNY. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen and that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

Bernstein & Co. LLC William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. Operator : And welcome to Procter & Gamble's Quarter End Conference Call. P&G would like to remind you that today's discussion will include a number of forward looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections. Also, as required by Regulation G, Proctor & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Proctor & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on the underlying growth trends of the business and has posted on its Investor Relations website, www.pginvestor.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP and other financial measures. Now I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: Good morning. With three quarters of the fiscal year complete, we remain on track with our going-in plans for the top and bottom lines against a backdrop of difficult market conditions. We're maintaining top line guidance, we're reconfirming bottom line guidance and we're increasing our outlook for adjusted free cash flow productivity to approximately 95% for the year. In the January to March quarter, organic sales were up 1%. Core earnings per share were up 12%, up 15% excluding foreign exchange. We generated $2.3 billion in adjusted free cash flow. We increased our dividend by 3%, the 61st consecutive annual increase and the 127th consecutive year P&G has paid a dividend, every year since our incorporation in 1890. The quarter did present challenging macro dynamics. As we and other companies indicated at the CAGNY conference in late February, and as you've seen in the track channel data, growth in our categories decelerated significantly in the quarter. The categories we compete in were growing on a value basis at a global average of nearly 3% in the first half of the fiscal year. Growth slowed to below 2% in the third quarter. In the U.S., our largest and most profitable market, categories in which we compete, grew roughly 2% in the first half but were up less than a point in the March quarter. Several factors contributed to this dynamic including delayed tax returns, higher gas prices, bad weather, and what appears to be a drawdown of at-home inventory during the quarter. Developing markets were up about 5% in the first half but slowed to about 4% in the third quarter. India de-monetization continued to impact consumption in that market. In Saudi Arabia, one of our 15 largest markets, a prototypical household has endured a 20% income reduction, while utility prices have doubled and will more than double again by July as government subsidies are reduced. Economic crises in Egypt and Nigeria are dramatically impacting category size and markets in Russia, Argentina and Brazil are also contracting. Retail inventory levels, primarily in the U.S., also contracted. Retail inventory reductions had nearly a full point impact on third quarter organic sales growth. In addition to these market dynamics, P&G organic sales growth continues to be impacted by our work to strengthen and streamline product forms and SKUs in our ongoing 10 product categories. This activity created about a half a point drag on organic sales in the quarter. With these challenges as background, we again grew organic sales 1% in the quarter, which was about what we expected when we give our update on the markets at CAGNY and communicated that it would be our weakest quarter of the fiscal year. For the third straight quarter, sales growth continued to be fueled by volume growth. Organic volume grew 1% on the quarter. Pricing and mix were essentially neutral to organic sales growth. Organic sales were \u2013 sorry, online organic sales were up 30% for the quarter, significantly outpacing offline sales. Online sales now represent 5% of our total business. Moving to the bottom line, core earnings per share were $0.96, up 12% versus the prior year. Foreign exchange created a three point headwind on third quarter earnings growth, so on a constant currency basis, core earnings per share were up 15%. On a year-to-date basis, constant currency core earnings per share growth is up double digits, on track to extend our streak of high single or double-digit constant currency core earnings per share growth to five straight fiscal years. Constant currency core gross margin decreased 20 basis points. Productivity savings of 210 basis points were more than offset by headwinds from mix, commodities and product reinvestments. Including foreign exchange, core gross margin was down 40 basis points. Core SG&A costs as a percentage of sales decreased 30 basis points. Productivity savings of 50 basis points and benefits from nonrecurring other operating gains were partially offset by investments in advertising, sales and R&D. Constant currency core operating margin increased 10 basis points. Productivity improvements contributed 260 basis points of operating margin benefit. Including foreign exchange, core operating margin was down 10 basis points versus the prior year. The core effective tax rate was 23.4%. This included several discrete tax reserve adjustments and the impact of share-based compensation transactions. The core effective tax rate has been in the range of 23% to 24% in six of the last seven quarters and we're now expecting to finish this fiscal year near the middle of this range. All-in GAAP earnings were $0.93 for the quarter including $0.03 per share of non-core restructuring costs. We generated $2.3 billion of adjusted free cash flow, returning $3.8 billion to shareholders, $1.8 billion in dividends and $2 billion in share repurchase. Earlier this month, we increased our dividend 3% as I said earlier. Fiscal 2017 is a year of significant value return to shareowners. We expect to pay dividends of over $7 billion. We reduced outstanding shares by $9.4 billion in the Beauty transaction and we expect to purchase over $5 billion of our stock. In total, about $22 billion of value returned to shareowners. In summary, despite some significant unforeseen challenges and macroeconomic headwinds, from market growth to currencies to commodities, we currently expect to deliver our going-in forecast for the year and are maintaining our organic sales and core earnings per share guidance ranges. We're holding our organic sales growth range of 2% to 3%. After three quarters, we're obviously at the low end of this range. We expect fiscal 2017 all-in sales growth to be down a point to in line with the prior year. This includes a two- to three-point headwind from the combined impacts of foreign exchange and divestitures. We're maintaining our outlook for core earnings per share growth of mid-single digits. As I've said, we continue to deal with an unprecedented amount of geopolitical disruption and uncertainty which is affecting market growth, currencies and commodities and we're not immune from these macro dynamics. We're aggressively driving cost savings to mitigate these impacts, but as we said last quarter and at CAGNY, we're protecting investments in the business to maintain and accelerate organic sales growth in a sustainable, market constructive, and value accretive way, even if this causes results to ultimately end up below the current core earnings per share guidance range. All-in GAAP earnings per share are forecast to increase by 48% to 50% including the one-time gain from the Beauty transaction that we booked in the second quarter. We continue to make good progress on cash and as a result are raising our expectations for adjusted free cash flow productivity from 90% or better to approximately 95% for the year. Now looking forward, the external challenges we face : slow market growth, geopolitical and economic instability, foreign exchange impacts from a stronger U.S. dollar, rising commodity costs and retail trade transformation are all very real and aren't likely to do meaningfully better in the near-term. With this as a reality, we're putting even more emphasis on several strategic moves : on product and package superiority, executional excellence, cost and cash productivity and organization design, culture and accountability. We're meaningfully raising the bar by establishing an even higher standard of excellence, that of irresistible superiority, for our products and packages coupled with superior execution of communication, in-store fundamentals and consumer value. This is what will be required in the slow growth environment to grow markets and market share. It's what is required to present commoditization of our categories and minimize deflationary impacts. It reduces promotion needs and creates strong relevance for retail partners in all classes of trade. To achieve the outcome we desire, category growth, increased household penetration, strong share positions and winning sales and profit growth in this difficult environment, we must combine a foundation of irresistibly superior product and packaging experiences with superior execution in advertising, sampling and in-store fundamentals with winning value equations broadly defined. What do we mean by irresistible superiority, and how will we measure it? When a consumer has an irresistibly superior experience with our products and packages, it raises their expectations for performance in the category and makes it hard to go back to what they were using before. To assess irresistible product superiority, we're moving from a single metric : weighted purchase intent, to a body of evidence approach. This provides a holistic and transparent evaluation of the product at the second moment of truth and integrates technical tests, line tests, context aided tests, household panel data and in-market product reviews. It ads behavioral data, which is more reliable than the attitudinal data we've historically collected. One element of this, for example, is depravation testing. In deprivation testing, we ask consumers to score the product they currently use, say out of 100 points. We replace the product they're currently using, typically a competitive product, with the product we're testing and have consumers use it for several weeks. Then we give them back their original product and ask them to score it again. If their score of the original product has not changed appreciably after use of the new product, we've not made a significant difference in expectation or delight and therefore wouldn't rate the new product as irresistibly superior. If they rate their old product significantly lower after use of the new product, we know the new product has elevated the level of performance they expect in the category. Tide PODS and Downy Unstopables scent beads are great examples of products that deliver irresistible superiority. After using PODS and scent beads for a four-week test period, consumers consistently lowered their assessment of their current product by more than 10 points, a meaningful move. Using these products changed consumers' views of what's possible in the Fabric Care category. These products have been on the market for five years and are still driving category growth and are growing market share. Our unit dose detergents, Tide PODS and Gain Flings! have accounted for 90% of laundry detergent category growth. Unit dose products account for about 15% of U.S. category sales with P&G holding nearly an 80% share of the form. We expect this form to continue leading category growth. In 2016, just 16% of U.S. households had tried unit dose detergents. The forecast for 2017 is 23% household penetration, a 40% increase in just one year. We're driving the growth of PODS with increased washing machine sampling. We'll distribute 30 million samples of our best performing detergents in fiscal 2017, a 75% increase over fiscal 2016. Fabric enhancers are the fastest-growing segment in the overall Fabric Care category, growing 7% to 8%. And scent beads are the fastest-growing form, growing in a 20% rate. P&G's scent bead offerings are growing over 30%, and there's tremendous upside. Scent beads household penetration is only 14%, and beads are currently used in only 4% of laundry loads. We're going to continue driving consumer awareness and trial through advertising campaigns and sampling programs to grow the category and grow our share. Irresistibly superior products are ideally delivered in irresistibly superior packages. Irresistibly superior packaging attracts the consumer at the first moment of truth, provides integrity and protects the quality of the product and delights consumers during use and in its responsible disposable. Irresistible packaging also creates recognizable brand blocks at shelf, aides the consumer in selecting the best product for their needs, and reinforces the equity of our brands. We're developing a body-of-evidence approach, like we now have with products, to test packaging superiority. Superior products and superior packages drive market growth. They prevent commoditization. Market growth has been an incredibly important part of the journey of our brands. U.S. Fabric Care is a good example. Over the last 40 years, P&G sales have grown five times, or 500%. P&G share has only increased five points. Market growth, driven by P&G, has been the main source of growth. Irresistibly superior product and packaging benefits need to be communicated to consumers with superior brand messaging. Superior brand communication is advertising that makes you think, talk, laugh, cry, smile, act, and, of course, buy; advertising that drives growth for brands in the categories in which they compete, and is a voice for good by expressing points of views on issues that matter and where the brand matters; advertising that clears the highest bar for creative brilliance, sparking conversations, affecting attitudes, changing behavior, and sometimes even defining popular culture. We're raising the bar in advertising quality with a focus on superior brand performance claims that communicate the brand's benefit superiority to create awareness and trial. We're improving the quality of consumer insights, agency creative talent and production. We're applying a body-of-evidence assessment to advertising quality. To be assessed as proven effective, our highest bar, a campaign must drive awareness, household penetration, and share growth for at least one full year, and be determined by a panel of objective experts to be effective advertising. Brands currently achieving the standard of quality include Always, Like A Girl; Tide, If It's Got To Be Clean, It's Got To Be Tide; Dawn, A Drop of Dawn and Grease Is Gone; and SK-II, Change Destiny. We're improving media execution, increasing consumer reach by 10 points, and ensuring year-round continuity across top markets. We're increasing point-of-market entry trial coverage by 10 points, or more, on our top brands. We're working to lead the effort on media transparency, eliminating costs in the media supply chain created by poor standards adoption, too many players grading their own homework, too many hidden touches, too many holes, where criminals can rip us off, and unsafe places for our brands to have ads. We're letting our spending talk, buying media from those that comply with the new standards we're setting, so that we know our ads are experienced by consumers in the most productive and efficient way. In-store execution is another area, where we're raising the bar, redefining excellence to a higher standard. We're determined to make our go-to-market activities a consistent source of competitive advantage to grow categories in our brands. This requires having the right trade coverage with the right product forms, sizes, and price points, and the right in-store shelving and merchandising execution that requires getting the key business drivers right for each category and brand in every store across all channels every day. In Brazil, we've revamped our trade spending programs to reward these specific activities by brand and by channel that are proven to drive sales. On Pampers, for example, it's ensuring we have a full range of sizes available in each store, plus a secondary point of sale. On Gillette, it's ensuring we have the right shelf space, open sales on MACH3, distribution of our three-bladed Prestobarba disposable and Venus razors for women, and increasing the number of distribution points and visibility at checkouts. We're working to make sure our brands stand out in-store. We're demonstrating the value of long-term displays of our leading brands to top retailers. These displays are high quality and clearly communicate our brand equities and product benefits. They replace in-and-out promotional displays that were often low quality and inefficient, both operationally and financially for P&G and for our retail partners. We're tracking compliance versus category-specific key business drivers in over 7,000 individual stores. When we get it right, category growth accelerates. Our growth accelerates, and we deliver trade spending efficiencies that enable us to reinvest and improve sales coverage to achieve excellence in even more stores. Just as important, we're tracking results against these key measures for our salespeople, ranking and internally publishing these results. The team has embraced this transparency and accountability, and it's driving better performance. We're piloting new approaches and technologies including crowdsourcing, image recognition, and machine learning to obtain granular real-time data on store conditions to optimize our performance and coverage. This ensures we get a transparent, accurate and unbiased view of in-store execution to hold our own salespeople and our distributors accountable for execution. The last element of superior execution, but certainly not least, is winning consumer and customer value equations. Price is one element of a winning consumer value equation, but what we're really looking at is the superior value of the total proposition. A product that meets a need in a noticeable and irresistibly superior way with a package that's convenient to use, with compelling communication presented in a clear and shoppable way in-store. Margin is one element of the customer value equation, but so is penny profit, trip generation, basket size and category growth. Where do we stand against these new, higher standards of irresistibly superior product and packaging and superior execution? Where a win on each element is required for a passing grade, we currently earn a passing grade versus this new, much higher benchmark about 30% of the time. Achieving this higher standard of excellence more consistently will require investment in improved product formulations, packaging, sales coverage, advertising sampling, upstream R&D and consumer and customer value. This need for investment, the external realities we're facing, our historical productivity progress and future productivity opportunities all inform our plans to save up to another $10 billion this fiscal year through fiscal 2021. We've continued to refine our plans and want to bring them to a more granular level for you today. We've identified $7 billion of saving opportunities in cost of goods sold. This comes on top of the $7.3 billion of cost of goods savings we delivered over the previous five years, exceeding our previous goal of $6 billion. We aim to fully synchronize our supply network and replenishment strategy from our customers to our suppliers, leveraging our supply network transformation in North America and Europe. This holistic transformation will ensure that we have a supply network that will continue to be a demonstrable and sustainable competitive advantage for P&G. This will require continued investment over the next two to three years but provide an attractive payout in ongoing lower costs, lower inventories, better customer service and lower out of stock levels. Within this strategy, the largest opportunity, about $4.5 billion of the $7 billion, is raw packaging materials. These savings will come from strategic supplier partnerships, supplier consolidation and through an overarching simplification of our SKU lineups and manufacturing platforms. We've established joint business plans with our top suppliers focused on end to end supply network synchronization with a goal of reducing product cost year-on-year. To enable integrative thinking, we're co-locating suppliers at our sites with our product supply and R&D professionals to deliver upstream co-innovation that can improve both product performance and drive savings. For example, we already have 55 suppliers collocated at our planning centers, with an objective to expand this further. In the pursuit of consolidating our supplier base, we expect to reduce the number of suppliers by about 20% over the next two years. We have several innovations aimed at delivering better-looking, better-performing and lower-cost packaging. Better and cheaper not just cheaper. One example is Air Assist, our fit-to-delight new packaging designed for e-commerce. Air Assist was originally intended to fix the mess that can sometimes result from shipping liquids, like Dawn dishwashing detergent, as single units to consumers. We did much more than fix a distribution problem. Air Assist packaging delivers a significantly better shelf impression, improves consumer in-use experience and reduces plastic usage by 50%. Better and cheaper packaging that delights consumers and a CFO. We're driving savings in packaging using Imflux, a proprietary injection molding innovation. Imflux enhances existing injection molds and presses and builds new molds that increase throughput up to 100%, resulting in higher quality injected molded parts, improved speed to market, fewer presses and molds and significantly lower costs. So that's raw and packaging materials. Manufacturing is our second largest spend pool, and we're aiming for about $1.5 billion of savings from reduced manufacturing expense. We're on a continuous manufacturing productivity improvement journey. Over the previous five years we've delivered a cumulative 26% manufacturing productivity improvement defined as the change in head count per cases produced. We've established an objective to deliver an additional 30% of improvement over the next five years. Much is driven by five major pillars comprising a renewal of a proprietary manufacturing productivity methodology of integrated work systems or IWS, synchronization of our production to demand signals, leveraging our supply network redesign with multi-category production sites in North America and Europe, and reducing the number of manufacturing platforms from 275 to 150. We're digitizing our manufacturing operations and automating with robotics using, for example, collaborative robots to automate activities like palletizing, and autonomous vehicles to move materials and pallets within our operations. We see an opportunity for additional $1 billion of savings from transportation, warehousing and other cost of goods sold. These savings will come from work to improve warehouse productivity by as much as 25%, digitized algorithmic planning that reduces inventory and optimizes vehicle fill rates and rebidding regional transportation lanes based on our optimized manufacturing site and mixing center locations. Our North America mixing centers have driven customer service to an all-time high with on-time deliveries moving from 84% to 94% and the ability to resupply 80% of our sales within 24 hours. We're on track to deliver over $1.5 billion in cost of goods sold savings this fiscal year, ahead of the pace needed to reach the five-year, $7 billion savings goal. We see over $2 billion of savings opportunity in marketing spending with half or more coming from media rates and eliminating media supply chain waste. We're targeting up to $0.5 billion more in savings from reduced agency fees and ad production costs and we see about $0.5 billion of opportunity in spending for in-store materials, direct-to-consumer programs and improved efficiency in trial building and sampling programs, all of this while strengthening our overall program, increasing reach, increasing continuity and improving effectiveness. We're targeting about $1.5 billion of savings in trade spend. This is a $15 billion spend pool, so just a 10% efficiency improvement basically gets us there. These savings will come from improved execution against category and brand key business drivers like the example I shared earlier from Brazil. This will be enabled by new trade spending analytics tools including by SKU gross profit contribution metrics that will be available to each of our salespeople as they manage distribution and merchandising programs with our retail partners. And we'll better optimize investments by category as we implement the end-to-end management model with dedicated sales forces in more large markets. We're estimating we can achieve between $1 billion and $2 billion of additional overhead cost reduction. This will require a particular focus on reducing the cost of activities that are furthest away from consumers or customers and increasing end-to-end business accountability. It will also include further digitization and automation of work processes. So in total, we've identified $12 billion to $13 billion of savings opportunity across all cost elements. We've risk-adjusted this down to up to $10 billion to account for the uncertainty that exists in each piece of this work, especially when projecting out several years. We're making good progress this fiscal year through three quarters. We're averaging 220 basis points of gross margin savings and 50 basis points of savings in SG&A. Just as a reminder, where there's much still to do, we start in a fairly good place. We have the second highest after-tax profit margin in the industry. Only Reckitt is higher, largely due to category mix. We've improved core gross margin by about two points over the last three years. What matters more than aggregate margin is the competitive comparison for each category. As we compare P&G versus competitors on a weighted average basis, we're in line or ahead in nine out of 10 categories. P&G's category gross margins are higher than competition by an average of about five points and up to as many as 14 points. We hold similar advantages in overhead. When we compare P&G's SG&A overhead costs to a competitive average weighted by P&G's business mix by sector, our costs are more than 100 basis points lower. Over the last four years we've reduced P&G's overhead costs as a percentage of sales by 50 basis points. This has allowed us to grow our aggregate 22% top quintile operating margin by more than two points over the last three fiscal years despite three points of cumulative FX headwind over that same time. We have further advantages in below the line costs, we borrow at some of the most favorable rates in the industry, and we have a tax rate that is among the lowest in the industry. While we're currently competitive, we have significant opportunity ahead of us. Over the next five years, with the plans I just outlined, we'll make further advances in our cost and margin structure. In addition to establishing a new standard of excellence for product performance and packaging and commercial execution, and continuing to drive significant cost savings, we're further strengthening our organization, design, culture and accountability; deeper mastery, closer to consumers and customers, more agile, more accountable, more efficient and more effective. We're changing talent development and career planning to drive more mastery and depth in each of our product categories. The objective is simple : improve business results by getting and keeping the right people in the right places to develop and apply deep category mastery to win. P&G is fortunate to consistently source and develop very strong talent, but we recognize that there are times when the best talent for a role may not be with inside our organization. Going forward, we will supplement internal development with hiring from the outside to add the skill and experience needed to win and field the best team possible. This fits with the broad theme of connecting with external sources of value and ideas. Innovation, connect and develop external advisory boards and partners, technical experts, agency creatives. External hiring has roughly quadrupled across five different levels of management, including senior line management. And last week a new president level Chief Information Officer to help our very important digital efforts. We've invested in selling resources and category dedication. In the U.S. over the last two years, we've added approximately 140 salespeople, including experienced external hires and now have over 90% of our sales covered by dedicated, category-dedicated, profit aligned category experts. In large markets like the U.S. and China, we're moving to and end-to-end ownership and accountability approach. This approach focuses on category specialization in the markets. We previously focused too much on scale by managing the sales force for a country across all categories limiting the ability to focus on the unique needs of each category. We're moving to a model where decision-making authority for the number of salespeople serving a category in a particular country and which channels those salespeople cover is the responsibility of the regional category leader. Category is a point of competition. It's the point at which consumers engage with our brands. Category leaders can choose to add sales resources in a given market and channel and they have the responsibility to pay for them since they're the P&L owners for that business. There's no one-size-fits-all approach. The goal is to drive fast and agile decision making with each category leader focused on what it takes to win in their business through the lens of consumers, shoppers and retail partners. We first implemented this end-to-end approach, giving category leaders responsibility from the front end of innovation all the way through to the store in the United States last fiscal year. We brought four more markets into the model this fiscal year, and we plan to add five more markets next year. In total, these markets currently generate over 70% of company sales. In smaller countries where we don't have the scale to organize in a dedicated end-to-end model, we're implementing a new freedom within a framework approach. The objective is to enable these smaller markets to be faster and more agile, within a framework, to be accountable to execute and achieve financial goals. Regional leadership will establish a strategy, product plan and top and bottom line objectives. As long as the market is executing within the predefined strategies and are delivering the financial target set by the region, they have freedom, within pre-established executional boundaries, to make real-time changes, adjusting pricing, marketing levels and in-store merchandising programs as the situation on the ground dictates without the need for engagement with regional resources. In the markets where we've tested this approach, it's enabled us to cut the number of internal review meetings in half, reduce the number of people participating in meetings and it's importantly enhanced agility in market responsiveness. We're expanding this freedom within a framework approach globally starting July 1. We're aligning incentives at a lower level of granularity to better match responsibilities and to increase accountability. Salespeople in some of our largest markets who are now dedicated to selling one product category now have the majority of their incentive comp tied to the performance that category, versus what was previously a region average across all categories. Category leaders for a region now have their incentive comp tied to the performance of their category in their region versus a global average for that category. Bottom line, we're committed to getting, keeping, and growing the right people in the right places, dedicated to categories to drive better business results. We're putting more granular incentives in place to match the increased end-to-end responsibility we're giving leaders. We believe that by continuing to strengthen the plays I've just talked about, irresistible product and packaging superiority coupled with superior commercial execution, strong cost savings and continued strengthening of our organization, design, culture, and accountability, we will be able to further accelerate our progress even in the challenging market conditions we face. So to wrap up our comments this morning, we're striving to achieve a higher level of excellence in all areas that support the growth of our categories and brands. We're hopeful this work, enabled by strong cost savings and improvements to our organization, design, culture, and accountability will get us back to the levels of balanced growth that delivers our shareowner value-creation objectives. Also, in summary, as I mentioned earlier, for this fiscal year, we're maintaining organic sales and core earnings per share guidance despite the unforeseen and significant setbacks from FX and slowing market growth. We're just now starting our detailed forecasting for next fiscal year. We won't be sharing specific guidance for fiscal 2018 until our next earnings call currently planned for August 2, but our intent is clearly to deliver another year of sequential improvement on both the top and bottom lines. With that, I'd be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. Your first question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Morning. Thanks. Your commentary around sort of irresistibly superior products was quite helpful, but it seemed to be targeted mostly at assessing existing product. Didn't really hear much about innovation, and more importantly, given the slowdown, particularly in emerging markets, what you can do to make products perhaps more affordable to consumers? And is there any thought on making even more meaningful changes in terms of either product formulations, or pack-out (35:38) sizes to bring the cash outlay for those consumers down? And then, in terms of this new focus area, does that mean that overall spending against sales needs to go higher, and maybe there's sufficient offsets in other buckets so that in aggregate, the margins are relatively unchanged? Thanks. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: That's a lot of questions, Olivia. I'll try here. First of all, innovation is the antidote to slow market growth, and so it is definitely something that we continue to focus on and invest in, and we want that to be guided by this notion of irresistibly superior products and packages, because we know that when we do that, we can affect the rate of market growth. I gave you the examples earlier of PODS and Downy Unstopables, which clearly do that, and that market growth is so important, as I described, explained in the U.S. laundry example. It, historically, has accounted for the majority of the company's growth. So we are very focused on maintaining our innovation leadership. If you look at the most recent IRI Pacesetters report, we had five out of the top innovations as measured by revenue in the last year, and that's a focus that will not go away. In terms of affordability, that's important, very important. There are multiple dimensions to that, including package size. I mentioned part of superior execution is ensuring we have the right package sizes in the right stores and channels, but one of the main endpoints there is affordability for consumers. Affordability, though, also is affected by efficacy and how well a product meets the need for which a consumer purchases that product. And that has to continue to be a significant part of our focus as well. Generally, we found when we can create superior value, holistically-defined, so combination of the experience, how well the product meets my need, the price of the product, how easy it is to find and use, that price isn't a barrier. That doesn't mean that we don't need to be sharp on our price points. We do, and you've seen us take several moves over the last year to get sharper on price points, but we're going to continue to be driven primarily by the concept of value and value superiority. You asked about spending on sales. We've talked for a couple years now of that being one of the reinvestments that we want to make, and there are two or three elements to that reinvestment. One is ensuring we have sufficient coverage across an increasing number of channels and formats. The second, and very, very important, is ensuring that we have, where it's economically possible, dedicated sales resources with experience and mastery in a category, serving a category on an end-to-end basis aligned with the profit owner of that category. And then the third is the capability to allow us to really step up our in-store execution. As I mentioned, both execution in-store but also the monitoring of that execution on a real-time basis to ensure that we get it right as frequently as possible. So hopefully that gets at the gist of your question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: Morning, Dara. Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So Jon, you mentioned a few strategic moves or changes today that you highlighted on the call in light of the current difficult environment and I had two questions from that. A, what's the motivation behind all these tweaks? Is it just that the external environment is difficult and you're being responsive to that? And then B, the broader, more strategic question would be, obviously you've made some very significant strategy changes in the last few years from the productivity you discussed in more detail today to paring the portfolio, et cetera, et cetera. You also mentioned a few additional tweaks or areas of emphasis today. So I'm wondering from a forward perspective as we look out, are there other more sizable or really large strategy changes potentially ahead? Or is now it just more a matter of executing on the previously announced changes and tweaks mentioned today as you manage through that difficult external environment? Thanks. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: Thanks, Dara. Your question on motivation for change is, simply put, winning. Clearly, the current environment makes that an even bigger challenge so that also informs the choices here, but the motivation is, very simply put, winning. We view the changes that we've talked about today, some of which, for instance, productivity we've talked about before, but we've tried to give you a better sense of the kinds of things we're going after to give you more confidence that that is something that's well within our capability to deliver. But these other things we're talking about, while relatively simple conceptually, are significant interventions. They're not significant interventions in that they disrupt organizations, but they're very significant in improving our execution, the delight that a consumer experiences with our product and package. We just have to get even better at that more consistently across markets, across categories, across brands. And again, as I've mentioned, when we do that successfully, all of our history tells us that we can affect the market growth rate as opposed to become a victim of that market growth rate. And you can see it very clearly across the portfolio where we have achieved this much new higher standard. It's working exactly as I described in most cases, and generally where we haven't, it's not. We're just in a very tough environment, and parity doesn't cut it in that environment. As Olivia mentioned, certainly parity at a higher price doesn't cut it. In terms of what's around the corner, what we're talking about here today is significant, both in terms of the investment, the effort, but more importantly, the result that we think it'll have on the business. And really what you should view this as is taking this new 10 category portfolio, better positioned from a profitability standpoint for growth, and now executing and driving that growth while continuing to increase profitability. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. Good morning, Jon. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: Morning. Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC : A question for you on Grooming, which was obviously soft in the quarter, down 6%. I was hoping you could talk \u2013 I have a handful of questions here, Jon. The negative price and unfavorable mix in the quarter, maybe you could discuss that a bit. Also Jon, the growth differential between the U.S. and international because more recently the company has been able to deliver some growth in that business despite the challenges or the much discussed challenges in the U.S., that would be helpful. And then two others and if you don't have this, I can follow up with Mr. Chevalier. With respect to Shave Clubs, are you still seeing penetration rates slow in the U.S.? Some of the more recent commentary suggested that. And then lastly, with some of the price cuts that you announced in the U.S. at the mid and lower end of the portfolio, is it your expectation you'll be able to offset that, or should we expect to see some margin erosion in that business? Thank you, and sorry for so many questions. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: No, good questions, Kevin. Thank you. In terms of the mix dynamic within that segment, that is largely geographic mix which gets to your second question. The sales outside of the U.S. were basically flat for the quarter, and I'll come back to that, so all the reduction is being driven by the U.S. and as you know, those are our most profitable cases and higher price cases. So that's simply what's going on there. In terms of the non-U.S. markets, and your point about them historically offering us growth is exactly accurate. Really what's happening is that we're annualizing a significant launch on the ProShield product in Europe, so Europe was down 5% with that in the base, but that's largely a base period dynamic. The way I would view Grooming broadly is pretty solid outside the U.S. Very strong progress on the female side of the business with Venus. We have a U.S. dynamic that's driven both by societal trends and by increased competition, which we're addressing very explicitly as you know. We've talked about that before. That's something that did not affect the results in the quarter, so that's still to come. But even before that, we're seeing, to your question on the Shave Club and other competitive dynamics, if you look at U.S. shave care volume shares, over the past 12 months, we're down 3.6 points. Over the past three months we're down 0.8 points. For the past month, we're up 0.7 points. And so part of that is annualizing a difficult period. I readily acknowledge that. But there's underlying progress that we're starting to see in terms of the share from a volume basis, and again, that's before the price reductions and the other interventions hit the marketplace. So again, very simply it's appropriately an area of focus, good business outside the U.S. Venus is going gangbusters. We've got a U.S. issue which we put plans in the market that have not yet taken place fully to address that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. First, Jon, I may have just misheard that, but did you say that non-U.S. sales were flat in the quarter? So then I'm guessing that means U.S. would've been up like two-ish? If you could just break those two out, that would be great for the first point. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: So sorry, Lauren. I was talking about Grooming. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Oh, okay. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: Yeah, so from a U.S. standpoint, total company, sales were down one point, and so the balance was up two to three points. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: Especially in developed markets. Developed markets are flat, developing markets were up three points in the quarter. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. So just with that in context, a lot of interesting and really important commentary on the call, but we haven't talked a lot about the quarter itself. So share progress, right, share and approaching market growth rates and so on was something that you guys had talked about as being very important to gauging success for 2017. So can you talk about progress in that regard, I guess in the U.S. and China, kind of two biggest markets, and then in the four big categories you've highlighted as being critical to success in gauging where things stand? Thanks. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: So overall share is still a small decrease, about 0.3 points over the past three months. If you split that across developed and developing, we're largely holding share in developed. We're flat versus year ago over the past three-month period. Most of the decline is in developing where we're down 0.6 share points. The majority of that is in China as we've talked, and is primarily driven by the Baby category where we've lost significant share because we don't have a competitive product, much less an irresistibly superior product in the premium, taped segment of the market. We have an entry that we're very excited about that will launch in August in that segment in China that's being sold into the trade currently. The testing on that product against some of the metrics that I described earlier is very encouraging so we're hopeful to be able to address that. The other major area of share loss we've already talked about this morning which is U.S. Grooming. So there's a market dynamic, and there's a share dynamic. And again, we've talked there about the steps we've taken to address that. Now sorry for mixing questions here, but getting back a little bit to Kevin's question as well, that is going to have a negative impact on top line growth in our margins in the near term, but it should improve our volume share position and allow us to both increase consumption, or at least remove a barrier for consumption, and be more competitive, allowing us to restart the cycle of growth on both the top and bottom lines. If you look at top-50 category country combinations as another measure of share progress, we held or improved our share position in 36 out of those 50 markets, sorry, our share trends in 36 out of those 50 markets. So we continue to make progress, but we're not yet where we want to be. Two big items : Baby Care China, U.S. Grooming, we're on it. Operator : All right. Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : All right. Thank you. Good morning. Jon, I sort of have a follow-on question on your endeavor to strive for irresistible superiority as it relates to your retail partners. While a very noble strategy on your part, I guess does such a premiumization strategy work in an environment where retailers are primarily looking to lower prices and increase value as a means of driving foot traffic? I guess I'm curious if you've been getting any pushback from your retail partners just because it sounds a little counter to what they might be looking for. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: Thank you, Bonnie. First, an important point. Irresistibly superior does not connote more expensive. It may in some cases. In other cases, it may not. And remember, we talked about superior execution as well, part of which is superior value equation holistically defined. If you talk about the retail universe broadly defined, what's driving most of their behavior is a search for their own organic growth, and foot traffic is an important part of that growth. Frankly, irresistibly superior offerings drive that traffic, and our retail partners look for us to play that role in their portfolios. It drives typically market basket, which is also something that's very important to them. So you're absolutely right to refer to the transforming retail trade landscape as something that we need to manage with, and frankly, I think there's no better tool available to us than exactly what we described. If we can bring to the market indispensable brands and products at a superior value equation and provide an in-store experience that provides value and delight to the shopper wherever she chooses to shop, we're going to win and our retail partners are going to win. And if we don't do that, it's hard to see that the outcome will be positive. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citigroup. Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. A couple follow-ups. Number one, you talked about packaging as being sort of a new area of emphasis or focus, whatnot. That surprises me a little bit because some of your competitors have talked about packaging maybe being less important going forward, particularly as consumers shop more and more online so how the product looks on shelves is less important. So I'd love your take on that and whether you're contemplating different packaging for products depending on which channel they're sold in. Second thing, the irresistible superiority concept I get, and I hear that it's working in detergent but I would question something like grooming where the consumer has clearly said, hey, and I think most reports say consumers agree that Gillette is the best performing products, but other things are more important, whether it's price, whether it's convenience, et cetera, et cetera. So can you gauge what percentage of your portfolio or what percentage of your categories you think sort of product performance and this concept of superiority from a product perspective actually matters to the consumer? Thanks. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: Great questions. To your second question first, we need to be day in and day out driven by the consumer, and what they want and prioritize. So the notion of irresistible superiority does not move for a nanosecond away from that focus. And remember, we talked about superior value equation as part of the dynamic and look at the move that we're making in the U.S. razor category. So I'm very concerned here that there's a misperception that a bar of irresistible superiority in products and packaging denotes higher prices or that we could get driven by a slogan and not by the consumer because that's not what we're all about here. And there's another aspect to irresistible superiority which is across the pricing ladder. So we want \u2013 take razor as the perfect example. Ultimately we want an irresistibly superior disposable razor that he or she believes is being offered to them with a superior value. We need an irresistibly superior product and package in the three-bladed systems segment of the market. We need the same thing at the high end of the market. So it's a very granular approach across, if you will, segments of consumers within an individual category who we're choosing to serve and each of those consumer groups that we're choosing to serve, we need to be relevant for and have that superior product. What is the number of categories that will respond to this? Remember, as we constructed the new company and the portfolio that we're going forward with, one of the screens, and it was a very intentional screen, is what drives purchase decision in that category? And we want to be in categories that are consumed on a daily basis and where purchase choice is driven by the ability of a product to meet a very specific need and where addressing that need is very noticeable and obvious to a consumer. And if you think across the product categories that we're in, if you're purchasing a laundry detergent, a baby diaper, feminine protection, anti-dandruff shampoo, deodorant, that's not an experiment for you. That needs to work. You're buying it for a reason. And if we can offer you a product that meets your needs in a superior way to other offerings, our categories tend to be very responsive to that. On the packaging piece, the increase in the amount of business that's done through e-commerce does not decrease the need for superior packaging. In fact, in some ways it increases it. There are product integrity challenges that are created by the e-commerce logistics channel that we need to address. And that's the Air Assist packaging I was talking about. That's one of the things that it's designed to address. There's also kind of a new moment of truth, if you think about it, in an e-commerce purchase. There's the first moment of truth which is on the site. There's the second moment of truth when you open that brown box and what's inside of it and how is that packaged. And that can be a delighter or that can be a detractor and we want that to be a delighter. And then of course there continues to be the next moment of truth which is the use of that product and it needs to perform in an irresistibly superior way. So also, 95% of the business that continues to be in bricks and mortars retail stores, that packaging is very important in terms of informing brand choice, educating, communicating with consumers, attracting her to the shelf. So I don't see packaging as being an area that should receive less attention going forward. If anything, it should receive more. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Joe Altobello with Raymond James. Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, guys. Good morning. First, just wanted to clarify something you mentioned earlier, Jon, on Grooming. How much of an impact, if at all, was there on order patterns from the price adjustments that you took given that they went into place I guess April 1? So maybe some delay in order patterns there. And then secondly, a little bit more color on one of the items you cited regarding slowing market growth which is retailer inventory reductions. How sustainable is this? Is this just a reflection of a new normal in terms of consumer traffic? Or was there some temporary component to it given that many retailers have a January fiscal year-end? Thanks. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: Thanks, Joe. Clearly there are dynamics around a major price change in a category, in a market, both as it relates to our brands but also as it relates to competitive behavior that a change to the dynamics within the window that perceives that period of time. I would have difficulty quantifying that for you, but there was certainly some impact associated with both order patterns and competitive behavior. The \u2013 sorry, I'm now forgetting \u2013 oh, slower market growth. The honest answer to your question, Joe, is I don't know. We think that the reduction in retail inventory levels was driven primarily by the consumer pattern that I describe in the U.S. that occurred in January and February, and we have seen a rebuild of some of those inventory levels as the consumer came back a little bit more strongly in March. April frankly is slowing a little bit. I don't know what that means. And you know, you have to realize we're talking about pretty small changes on the margins. They have a big impact on our results in any one quarter, but it's hard to look at that and understand therefore what the future looks like. There's nothing systemic that makes intellectual sense which would indicate why inventories should contract dramatically. Both retailers and ourselves still have significant out-of-stock opportunities to address. The last thing a retailer wants is a customer, once they've finally attracted her or him to their store, to not find the product that they want to buy. So I don't see anything systemic. I think this is more month-to-month volatility, management of cash positions as you rightly pointed out around quarter-ends. I expect that volatility to continue but I don't see a systemic trend one way or the other. Operator : Our next question will come from (01:01:47) with Deutsche Bank. Unknown Speaker : Yes. Hi. Good morning. Thank you. So Jon, if you could just expand a little bit on what is going to drive the acceleration in Q4, because it seems to get to the midpoint of the guidance you need to do a 4%. And I know that you talked about some new innovation and it looks like the China diaper new product is now going to be in August. So if you could just remind us what are some of the things that are going to happen in Q4 to drive the acceleration? Thanks. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: First of all, relative to the guidance, there's a range for a reason. And I won't project where within that range we'll necessarily be. Time will tell. But I did mention in our prepared remarks that year to date, we were at the low end of that range. So I wouldn't necessarily assume a dramatic acceleration of the order of magnitude that you cite would occur in the fourth quarter. Having said that we certainly don't expect, given current market growth \u2013 it's all going to come down to market growth, quite frankly. And that's going to be the biggest driver in the difference between the fourth quarter and the third quarter. We progressed on shares in the third quarter but the markets were down. If we continue progressing on shares and markets continue to be soft, it'll be a soft quarter. If we continue progressing on shares and the markets pick up, it'll be a better quarter. Operator : Our next question will come from Steve Powers with UBS. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks. Good morning. I guess just stepping back, you've made a lot of incremental investment over the past year, Jon, and the quest for irresistible superiority in an increasingly difficult operating environment implies sustained if not increasing reinvestment in the years ahead. So I guess the question is, when does all this investment ultimately result in a true advantage for P&G so that we can get back to winning, as you said earlier? And has your timing or definition of winning changed at all with respect to that? Because I think the concern is what we're just seeing is that this is all just the added cost of keeping pace and that cost is going up in an environment where functionality gaps between high and low end products are getting narrower, price gaps remain wide, consumers are becoming increasingly discerning and hard to reach, et cetera. So I guess just to distill it down is, when does this result in winning, or is this just the cost of keeping pace? Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: Good question, Steve. Let's step back a little bit. What we talked about doing this year was improving incrementally both the top and the bottom line, driving productivity to facilitate reinvestment, and we're right on track with those objectives. We're on track to deliver our going-in plan on the top line, our going-in plan on the bottom line. Going forward as I mentioned, we're still constructing the details of the plan for next year, but we would expect to improve again on both the top line and the bottom line. So sequential progress continuing to increase the number of category country combinations where we are winning. We've also talked very clearly about the need and our commitment to balanced top line and bottom line growth. And there's not a scenario here that we're anticipating that would violate that expectation, so the productivity facilitates the reinvestment. It also allows us to continue to increase the contribution from our bottom line. And in terms of the question of cost of competing, to the extent that we can continue to stay ahead of competition, where we are offering a benefit that the consumer prefers at a price that she sees as a significant value, there's no reason why these investments shouldn't pay off. But it's also why establishing this higher benchmark for how well these products need to perform and how effective the package needs to be against each of its objectives and how well we need to communicate those benefits, it's appropriate to do at this time. Operator : And next we'll go to Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yeah, thanks for the question. I'll keep it brief because most of my questions have been answered, but, Jon, you really provided some nice detail in geographic trends across your business first half versus second half. I was wondering if maybe you can give us some context around some of the categories, subcategories, in the portfolio. That would be really helpful. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: Well, I think you effectively have that through the segment data and the data that we provide you on the website. But each of the segments grew in the quarter with the exception of Grooming which we've talked a lot about, appropriately. So the growth is pretty broad-based. Our best performing businesses from a top line standpoint right now are ... Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC : I'm sorry, Jon. I was talking about category growth. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: Oh, sorry. Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yeah, not P&G's growth. Sorry about that. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: Much prefer talk about our growth. Just kidding. I'll tell you what. I'm going to have John get back to you on that, okay? I don't have that sitting right here in front of me. Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay perfect. Thank you. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: Thanks, Nik. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Just going to be brief on basically the margin and reinvestment going back to Steve's question. On Beauty specifically, you had a huge decline on operating results, right? So I was wondering if this is temporary. I understand, of course, the Grooming is also had a big impact, but is there something about the reinvestment that we should continue to cycle through the end of, obviously, the fourth quarter and continuing through the beginning of next year? Fiscal year? Or how should we look at this in terms of the reinvestment in Beauty specifically, and a little bit of Baby as well? Thank you. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: We're making significant interventions in both Beauty and Baby currently. Beauty, our largest hair care and conditioner innovations in quite a while, were introduced into the marketplace in the U.S., for example, in the January-March quarter, so that's what you see being reflected there. Also investments in Olay. On Baby, we're making big investments both in improving product superiority, for instance, in China, as I talked about, but also participating and leading the rapid growth in the pants segment of the market, where we are now market leaders, and that's paying off extremely well. In terms of exact investments by category, that's what we're going to have to determine as we go through our planning process for next year, but let me remind you again, we are committed to a balanced approach to grow this business, growth on the top line, and growth on the bottom line with strong cash performance, and there's not a scenario that we would anticipate that would differ from that expectation. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge Research. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Thanks, Jon. You mentioned that extra moment of truth that comes from e-commerce. I mean, you covered this before, but it seems like every day we get closer to more and more disruption, more anecdotes about the importance of e-commerce, you guys having so much success in it. Where in your portfolio do you think, if any place, your business gets stronger in a post e-commerce, full-adoption world, wherever that gets? Like where do you feel like, wow, I'm sure glad e-commerce came along and we're competing there versus three or four years ago when it was a non-impact? And do you think, big picture, you're reaching a point anywhere globally? And do you reach a point in the future, where your margin structure your returns, however you think about it, your mode is bigger because of e-commerce versus the way you're going to market today? Thanks. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: That's a very interesting question. First, let me just comment on the progress on e-commerce. I mentioned earlier, organic sales grew 30% online in the quarter. It's now 5% of our business, maybe it's about a $3 billion business. It's primarily focused, but not exclusively, in the U.S., China, and in Northeast Asia, particularly Korea. China is about a $1 billion business online currently. I would expect that'll be 20% to even as high as 30% of our business within the next 12 to 18 months, so that's moving very quickly. Korea, it's 40% of the business today. The U.S. development in e-commerce is very different by category, with some of the bulkier and heavier products appealing to people online, so they're not having to fill up their shopping carts with those items, baby diapers, as an example, but also items were more specialized attention. Skin care, for example, is seen as a benefit. In terms of the broad statement on preference for development of this channel versus other channels, we want to be in a position to be agnostic. We want to serve consumers in a superior and delightful way wherever they choose to shop. There has been a lot of talk though about kind of the other side of your question, which is what happens to big brands, businesses like P&G in an e-commerce context, and is that good or bad? And we actually believe that it's good, that we can be very effective in an e-commerce world, and our market shares currently bear that out. Our online shares, on an aggregate basis globally, about equal to our offline shares, and as I said, the growth rates, not just from a growth standpoint but also from a share growth standpoint, are currently higher online than they are offline. There are two kind of discussions that occur relative to the online environment, and people who prognosticate the demise of big brands in that environment refer to lower barriers to entry, and they refer to what I'll call the land of endless assortment. And clearly, there are lower barriers to entry, which is a threat to our business but is also something we can benefit from if we're proactive about it just as well as anybody else can. From an assortment standpoint, if you actually look at shopping behavior, a typical shopper exposes themselves to a lower, smaller assortment online than they do offline. When they go to the store, they're exposed to what's ever there. Very few shoppers click through to the third or fourth page of a search, and what typically shows up on the first page of a search are the more popular offerings, the larger offerings. And then there are tools, whether it's subscription or other tools that allow us to increase the loyalty of those consumers to our brands. So there are many aspects of that environment, sorry for being so long-winded, that we see as real advantages and that we can exploit. But we also like our odds in brick-and-mortar environments, which continue to comprise 95% of purchases of our products. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks, and morning, everybody. Wanted to ask a different way on the Beauty question. So I guess given relaunches of certain hair care brands, certain SKUs of Olay, are you pleased with the performance, so far, I guess especially if you back out continued strong growth of SK-II? And what else do you need to do to really reinvigorate the business? Because even inclusive of SK-II, it would seem that the results are a bit below category growth. And then just one housekeeping question. What is the new breakout in COGS for product reinvestments? What is that? How should we think about that on a go-forward basis just given I think that was new this press release? Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: Beauty care has been continually improving. I think this is our sixth quarter in a row of organic sales growth. We have some very strong brands within that. Certainly SK-II is one of them. Head & Shoulders is another one. Pantene, on a global basis, has been doing very well. Some of our personal care businesses have been doing well. So I don't want to give you the impression that it's \u2013 we're very happy with the progress on SK-II, but it's not carrying the show in its entirety. We still have opportunities in Beauty, as well, in the hair care line, some of the smaller brands. We just relaunched and re-staged Herbal Essence which is doing extremely well. That grew 6% in the quarter versus a year ago. But we still have work to do on Aussie and Rejoice as an example and within skin care, we're still making progress on Olay. But six quarters of growth we'll take, and we have very strong plans going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jon Andersen with William Blair. Jon R. Andersen - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the questions. On the online organic growth rate of 30%, thanks for the color on that. I guess, could you provide a little more context around how that 30% compares to recent trends you've seen in your online business and how you think about that growth rate perhaps going forward? And then I was wondering if you could tie that into maybe the work you're doing on the supply chain network transformation? You've talked quite a bit about the cost savings and the productivity elements of the supply network transformation but is there \u2013 to what extent is that work also facilitating your ability to serve the e-commerce channel through different packaging configurations, faster time to market, et cetera? Thank you. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: Great question. Growth rates, not a significant change this past quarter versus recent quarters but continued strong. I'm really glad you asked the question on the supply chain redesign because it definitely enables us to improve our ability to serve the consumer in an e-commerce environment and to better serve both e-commerce retailers and bricks-and-mortar retailers. There are several aspects of this. One is getting the manufacturing facilities themselves and the distribution centers in the right places in the markets relative to population centers that allow us to bring products to consumers, whether it's in a e-commerce fulfillment environment or a bricks and mortar environment in a very efficient fast, and very efficient low-cost way. And the way that we were set up before with factories kind of all over the place, the design being simply an artifact of history, we were not set up well to do that, and that was one of the motivations that caused us to move to this new model. There are significant opportunities, and I mentioned actually I think perhaps in the last call, within that supply chain redesign to improve our ability again to serve e-commerce consumers but also bricks-and-mortars consumers. And the whole idea of being able to get kind of our lighthouse if you will, that's being able to produce eaches, so single packages in rotation. So as they're ordered, at the same cost that we're producing large batches of product today. And we have a lot of pretty exciting progress in that area with robotics and other things. We still have a lot of work to do, but that's where we want to be from a customer service standpoint and a consumer delight standpoint ultimately in the supply chain vision. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. So I have two questions. One small, one big. The small one is just around the SG&A. I mean, you talk a lot about cost savings obviously, but without this 110 basis points from other operating income, it looks like you didn't cut enough relative to how much you sent back. So I just want to understand what the other operating income is. Sorry if you've already talked about it, and what we should expect going forward. But the bigger question, to me a really a big confusion point and I apologize, is I want to go back to winning and irresistibility that you mentioned because from a strategic perspective I just don't understand irresistible superiority because if you're saying that market share shifts aren't going to be the big driver of your growth and you quoted some numbers, Jon, that haven't been, and irresistible superiority isn't striving to premiumization, something you emphasized a couple of times to answering a couple questions, i.e. price mix isn't going to be driving category growth. I guess I'm confused as to what it is. I'm confused about how investing back into the business for no share gain and no pricing growth or limited pricing growth is a good deal for investors, and really toward the definition of what winning means to me, or more importantly, what it means to you. And instead, would it be better to admit like you did in Gillette in some sense and it looks like you did a little bit in laundry and a little bit in diapers right now given the pricing competition that's out there, that your categories are becoming diminishingly important to consumers, and actually investing in this irresistibility is actually the wrong strategy. It's not the winning strategy. So being premium in commoditized categories may not be the right strategy, and you're saying it's not premium. So I don't understand \u2013 for my question clearly, I don't understand if you're not getting share gain, if you can't go to pricing, how are to going to grow category growth, if that's what you want to do. Sorry. Thanks. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: No, don't be sorry. That's a good question. First of all, where we drive market growth, we almost inevitably build share. This is not walking away from share, and we've talked about the importance several times on this call about market share. What I'm trying to say is if that's all we do, if we gain a small amount of share of a market that's stable or declining, that's a small victory. A large victory is driving market growth and capturing a disproportionate amount of that growth, and there's huge value creation in that. So these are not separate concepts. They augment each other. And the sustainability of growth that occurs when we're driving market growth is much, much higher than if all of the growth is simply coming from somebody else. Because they have their economic realities, they have their investor realities, and the response to that is very predictable. So for example, when we went into the adult incontinence category, we had a very, very clear objective, which by the way is not just important for us. It's important for our retail partners. Imagine the presentation that occurs when you walk into a customer and say I've got this great idea. We think it's going to build two share points. Why do they care? They typically don't. What they care about is does this grow their business in total? So that when we launched into the adult incontinence business, we had a very clear objective that we communicated with our retail partners, that our job was to grow that category. And we basically doubled the growth rates in both the U.S. and Western Europe as a part of that launch and are doing very well. We've obviously, as a part of that, built our share from zero to meaningful share. So again, those concepts are not divorced. On the whole question of premium and consumer choice and preference, I would say a couple things there. First, we want to be irresistibly superior at all relevant price segments of the market, not just in the premium price segment. What that allows us to do, if we do it well, is offer products \u2013 razors is a good example, disposable products \u2013 at a slight premium to other disposable offerings, re-bladed systems, high-end systems. Each of those offerings, because that consumer segment defines itself, we want to be superior in. But that does not lead to a notion that we're going to focus entirely on premiumization of the business. We're going to focus on superiority. Relative to price sensitivity, there are very different things happening in different markets around the world and very different consumer behavior across segments. China is premiumizing rapidly. Our biggest problem in China is that we're not premium enough. And that's, for instance, what the Baby Care launch is designed to address in the Baby Care category. That's what the Oral-B toothbrush launch was designed to do and it's working very well. So this notion that the categories have become commoditized and that there's only one shopper and all she cares about is price, doesn't care about product benefit. It's just not true as we look at our business, both on a U.S. basis and on a global basis. In many parts of the world including the U.S, our fastest-growing offerings are some of the premium offerings. Now, I don't want that to be mistaken as that's where we're going to premiumize business. That's not the point. But where that consumer exists and wants to purchase, we need to be available and relevant. I mentioned the growth of the bead segment. Strong double digits. That's a premium price offering. Tide PODS and Gain Flings!, those are premium priced offerings. And again, I'm not referencing those to suggest that that's entirely what we we're focused on, but where there's a consumer that wants that, and I mentioned earlier, we want to keep the consumer very much entirely within our focus, we're going to serve that consumer. And I just don't see the environment that's being described. I see aspects of it and certain consumer segments for which price is a more important part of their value equation and we need to serve that consumer. But there are many different behaviors that are occurring across the world. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust. William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. Hey, Jon, just a commentary on the quarterly trends, the comment of late tax returns and weather and pantry de-loading. I think we all heard that and had questions about why the U.S. has been so soft. But I guess the question is, do you believe those really are the issues? Or is there something bigger? Have you seen some kind of improvement as we've moved past it in the quarter or even into April? Or is there something else going on that you've figured out? Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: So as I mentioned to somebody earlier, I don't really know the answer here, Bill. What we saw, and that I do know, was significant decline in category growth rates, I'm talk about the U.S. now, in January and more significant in February with a rebound in March. And April is, by all indications, relatively soft. And I don't know what all the drivers are of that. And we're just going to have to see as we go forward. And as I said, that's going to have an impact, hopefully a positive one, but it will have an impact on our results both this year and next. Operator : And your last question will come for the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good morning, folks. Thanks for making the time for me. Thanks for holding me out to be the closing act. I appreciate that. Two questions. First, I don't think you answered Ali's question, and I apologize if you did, on the corporate income, the 110 basis points of other income margin which I think equates to like $0.05. What was it? And then secondly, the bigger question, kind of going back to the theme of running hard to stand in place. Turning to margins, $10 billion of productivity right now, mix has sort of resurfaced and annualized, that rate will leak out $3.5 billion over five years. Inflation kind of running at sort of a similar offset or a similar drain, if you're not able to offset it. And then this reinvestment, if we annualize it, that tallies to around $3 billion over five years too. You just kind of gobbled up the $10 billion. Is that the right way to think about it? Or are there offsets that are going to allow you to let some of that $10 billion flow to the bottom line? Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: Thanks, Jason. And thank you for reminding me of Ali's first question. I kind of got lost in the bigger question. Most of that benefit related to the gain on the sale of an office facility, and so that's what drove that. There were also some other impacts, but that's the most significant one. In terms of the question on mix, and the last question on savings flowing through to the bottom line, the mix impact in the quarter, the easiest way to contextualize that is that that is almost entirely driven by two things. One is the change in the growth rate in the U.S. which is our most profitable business. So we had a business that was down in the U.S. When that happens, just because of the relative profitability of the U.S. business, we're going to have a negative mix impact. That's not our plan going forward, so as that reverses itself, that mix impact should largely disappear. The second piece of that mix impact, think about it through a different lens, through a product lens, our U.S. grooming business is a very profitable business. And so when that is down, from a top line standpoint, that also creates a negative mix impact. We have the plans in place to address that. So I don't expect, course, I don't have a crystal ball, I don't know what relative growth rates of categories and markets are going to be for the next five years. But nothing that's happened in this quarter changes my view in terms of what the likely long-term result is, which, as we've talked about before, is balanced top and bottom line growth. I've told you that we can't get to where we want to get without \u2013 we can't get there entirely through the top line, we can't get there entirely through the bottom line, we need both. And margin expansion is a part of that. The amount of savings that ultimately come through, we'll be working that as we formulate our plans next year, but the productivity purpose is twofold. It's to support the investment in all the activities that we talked about today that drive the top line, and it's to provide opportunity to grow margin. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: So thank you very much for spending time with us today. I realize we went through quite a bit. I'm very happy to take time with you later today or over the balance of the week to answer any questions you have, or to go into more detail. Thanks a lot. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

Operator : Good morning and welcome to Procter & Gamble's Quarter End Conference Call. P&G would like to remind you that today's discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections. Also as required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on the underlying growth trends of the business and has posted on its Investor Relations website, www.pginvestor.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP and other financial measures. Now I will turn the call over to P&G's Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: Good morning. I'm joined this morning by our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, David Taylor, and by our Vice President of Investor Relations, John Chevalier. I'm going to quickly review our fiscal 2017 and Fourth Quarter Results. David will discuss our plans. And I'll close our remarks with guidance for fiscal 2018. We'll then open the call for your questions. We met or exceeded each of our going-in fiscal 2017 objectives in what turned out to be a very challenging year. India currency demonetization and goods and services tax implementation, geopolitical uncertainty and economic weakness in Nigeria, Egypt, and the Middle East, Argentina, Brazil, Russia, and the Ukraine, and also Brexit each challenged us. Foreign exchange and commodity costs were a combined $600 million after-tax headwind on earnings. And we took a direct hit from a tornado at our Albany, Georgia, family care plant. Underlying market growth decelerated from 4% last fiscal year to about 3% in fiscal 2017. Within this, U.S. market growth slowed from over 2% last year to just above 1% this year and barely above flat in the fourth quarter. UK market growth declined about a point in fiscal 2016 and nearly 2 points in fiscal 2017. Developing market growth slowed from over 6% last fiscal to about 5% this year. And as you know we took some meaningful price reductions, including on Gillette in the U.S. Not knowing that most of this would happen at the start of fiscal 2017 we targeted about 2% organic sales growth, which is ultimately what we delivered. It's a meaningful achievement in the face of the headwinds I've just described. And it includes half a point of headwind from brand and product form discontinuations that we've discussed throughout the year. Importantly the growth was 100% volume driven. We planned as we went into the year to reduce the gap between P&G top line growth and that of the underlying market. We accelerated organic sales growth by more than a point from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017 in a market that decelerated by more than a point. We held or improved our relative share performance in 35 of our largest 50 category country combinations, either extending market share gains or narrowing share declines. We said we'd complete the strengthening and streamlining of the category and brand portfolio, building value in the process, which we did. We expected to make strong cost savings progress in the first year of the next $10 billion productivity program, which we accomplished. We expected a small improvement in core operating margins. We exceeded those expectations. Core operating margin increased 60 basis points, 90 basis points excluding foreign exchange. We targeted mid-single digit core earnings per share growth. We exceeded this objective, delivering $3.92 per share, up 7% versus last year. On a constant currency basis up 11%. Net of reinvestments into innovation, sales coverage, media and sampling, productivity savings have enabled us to deliver constant currency core gross and operating profit margin improvement and high single to double digit constant currency core earnings per share growth in each of the last five fiscal years, averaging 11%. Over the last four fiscal years, we've grown core gross margin by 200 basis points, 450 basis points excluding currency impacts. We've grown core operating margin by 270 basis points, 610 basis points excluding foreign exchange. Our core after-tax margin now stands at about 17%, second highest in our industry. We'll improve this further as we go forward. Going into the year we projected another year of 90% or better free cash flow productivity and delivered 94%. Inventory and payables improved by one day and four days, respectively. And fiscal 2017 was a year of significant value return to P&G shareowners. We paid $7.2 billion in dividends. We reduced outstanding shares by $9.4 billion with the shares exchanged in the Beauty transaction. And we made over $5 billion of direct share repurchases. In total, nearly $22 billion in dividend payments, share exchange, and share repurchase. A quick summary of the key top and bottom line metrics for the year. Organic sales were up 2% on organic volume growth of 2%. All in, sales were down less than half a point due to headwinds from foreign exchange and minor brand divestitures. Core earnings per share were $3.92, up 7%. All in, earnings per share were $5.59, up 51%, including the significant gain from the Beauty transaction. Adjusted free cash flow productivity, as I said earlier, was 94%. Details of our fourth quarter results are provided in the press release published earlier this morning, so I'm just going to hit a few of the highlights. Underlying market growth for the quarter was about 2.5%, reflecting many of the market challenges I mentioned earlier. Organic sales increased by more than 2% on organic volume growth of more than 2%. All in, sales were in line with the prior year. Online organic sales were up around 30% for the period, significantly outpacing offline sales. Online sales represented more than 5% of our total business in fiscal 2017. Core earnings per share in the fourth quarter were $0.85, up 8%. All in, earnings per share were $0.82, up 19%. Core gross margin decreased 10 basis points. 270 basis points of productivity savings was largely offset by a 120 basis point headwind from higher commodity costs and 90 basis points of mix impact. Core SG&A costs as a percentage of sales decreased 220 basis points. Excluding foreign exchange, core SG&A cost declined 170 basis points including 80 basis points of productivity savings from the combination of overhead, agency fee and ad production cost reductions. The remaining reduction was driven by current period choices to temporarily stop spending with digital media outlets where our ads were not being placed according to our standards and specifications. Core operating profit improved 210 basis points, including 350 basis points of productivity savings. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 125%. So to summarize fiscal 2017, we delivered or over delivered each of our objectives in what was a very challenging year and made significant progress on key priorities, accelerating organic sales growth, continuing to drive strong productivity improvement and cost savings, strengthening our organization and culture, and completing the moves to strengthen and focus our portfolio; significant progress, which we're singularly focused on increasing in fiscal 2018. I'll now hand it over to David to discuss those plans. David S. Taylor - Procter & Gamble Co.: Thanks, Jon, and good morning everyone. I want to start my comments this morning where I ended them on the call last year. Our standards are high. We aren't satisfied which just being a little bit better than last year. We want to be the best. And we're determined to win. We are making progress, but we know there's more work to do. Our objective is very clear. Balanced top and bottom line growth that consistently delivers total shareholder return in the top third of our peer group. The work we've began and the progress we've made have us building toward this level of results. Now as an organization, we are accelerating efforts to execute and deliver on the plans we've put into action. Achieving our objectives will not only require continued focus as an organization, but also that we prevent anything from derailing the work that is delivering improvement. We're working to accelerate organic sales growth by strengthening and extending the advantages we've created with our products and packages, improving the execution of our consumer communication and on-shelf and online presence, and ensuring our brands offer superior consumer value in each price tier we choose to compete. Now I've had several questions on what is really changing, so I want to add a little bit of perspective. And this is not a marketing pitch but a statement of intent backed by action of what we've been doing and we will continue to do over the coming quarters and years. The market clearly continues to be challenging, whether it's price transparency, changing retail dynamics, or established or new competitors, online and off-line, or slowing market growth. The best response in this environment is innovation and a greater level of superiority in all elements of the consumer proposition. A higher standard. That is what we're doing, starting with the consumer and shopper. That's where we believe sustained success must start. Now the superiority of our products, packages, execution, and consumer value create impactful, meaningful advantages that will earn trial and repurchase; that grow markets and build market share. It is what will be required to prevent commoditization of our categories and minimize deflationary impacts. It is required to reduce our promotion spending and create strong retail relevance across channels, off-line and online. Now at times people misunderstand this one. But superiority does not mean most expensive or premium. It means delivering maximum value, holistically defined across all price points at which we choose to compete. We need to deliver a big enough advantage to change consumers' affinity for our brands and their expectation of the category. And to assess and deliver superior products, we're moving from a single metric, which is typically used as weighted purchase intent, to a body of evidence approach. This approach provides a holistic and transparent evaluation of the product at the second moment of truth. It integrates technical tests and blind tests, context dated tests, household panel data, and in-market product reviews. It adds behavioral data, which is more reliable to the attitudinal data we've historically collected. Now there's many examples I could give. First, Tide PODS provides a great one. After using PODS for a four-week test period, consumers consistently lowered their assessment of their previously used detergent by more than 10 points. Using Tide PODS changed consumers' performance expectation of a laundry detergent. Tide PODS and Gain Flings! have driven 90% of U.S. laundry detergent category growth since they were introduced. Today, those products generate 15% of category sales with P&G holding nearly an 80% share of the form. We expect this form to continue leading category growth. In 2016 just 16% of U.S. households had tried unit dose detergents. 2017, we're up to 23% of household penetration, a 40% increase in just one year. Ariel PODS are making a similar impact in developing markets where we've launched. In Poland, unit dose products account for over 25% of laundry market value with P&G holding over 60% share of the form. 36% of households in Poland use unit dose detergents. In Romania, unit dose products account for nearly 20% of the laundry market with P&G's share of the form reaching almost 80%. Household penetration is nearly 30% in Romania. In both markets, the unit dose segment is growing. We have plans to expand this superior form in Japan early this fiscal, followed by a few other markets later in the year. Another example, Always Radiant. It's a product that's meeting the higher standard of excellence as our best performing feminine pad. Always Radiant has superior ratings across all the body of evidence testing for product and packaging. The technology absorbs 10 times its weight with unique proprietary absorbent material, and provides up to 100% leak-free protection. The packaging design is eye-catching, innovative, and premium, preferred 4.5 times over competition in a controlled test. And not surprisingly, business results are very strong, re-sales are up mid-teens driving market growth of the super-premium segment, plus 7%. Radiant's share in the U.S. pad market is up nearly a point over the past six months. We've launched this superior premium product in China, and early results are positive. Always Radiant and Infinity hold the number one share position of the super-premium segment. Now packaging's another area where we see great opportunities for innovation, both online and off-line. Different distribution channels demand different packaging solution. One size doesn't fit all, but it may fit for many. We look to reapply packaging success models across the company. A great online package innovation in China may also be great for online businesses in Japan, Korea, Europe, or the U.S. But it may not be good for hypermarkets in any region. Superior packaging attracts the consumer at their first moment of truth, provides integrity and quality protection, and delights the consumer during use and in its responsible disposal. Superior packaging creates recognizable brand blocks at shelf. It aides the consumer in selecting the best product for their needs. And it conveys the equity of the brand and importantly closes the sale. We're developing a body of evidence approach like I described with products to test packaging superiority. There's some examples here. Scent beads are doing a great job on both the product and the package. It delivers against this new higher standard. When consumers use scent beads for a four-week test period, they consistently lowered their assessment of their current product by more than 10 points. The packaging shows the product and communicates the scent benefit with the squeezed scent release. It's distinctive, familiar, and appealing. Fabric enhancers are the fastest growing segment in the overall fabric care category, growing mid-single digits. And scent beads are the fastest growing form, growing at a 20% rate. P&G scent bead offerings are growing over 30%. Now there's tremendous upside. Scent beads household penetration is only 14% and beads are currently used in only importantly 4% of laundry loads today. We're going to continue driving consumer awareness and trial through advertising campaigns and sampling programs to grow the category and grow our share. And we'll enter new markets this fiscal year. Superior products and superior packages drive market growth. This prevents commoditization. Market growth has been incredibly important in the journey of our brands. Over the last 40 years P&G's U.S. Fabric Care business has grown by 5 times, or 500%, in a market that's grown 4 times. P&G share has increased only 5 points. Market growth has been the main driver of P&G's growth, which we've driven with leading innovation. Over the past 40 years P&G's global diaper business has grown 12 times, 1,200%, in a market that's grown 11 times. P&G's share has increased only modestly. Market growth has been the main driver of P&G growth. And we've led it with innovation and conversion of cloth diaper users. Product and package benefits need to be communicated with exceptional brand messaging. Advertisement makes you think, talk, laugh, cry, smile, act, and of course buy. Advertising that drives growth for brands and the categories in which they compete. Advertising that clears the highest bar for creative brilliance, sparking conversations, affecting and sometimes changing attitudes, changing behavior, and even defining popular culture. We're setting a higher standard of excellence on advertising quality with a focus on brand performance claims that communicate the brand's benefit superiority to create awareness and trial. We're improving the quality of consumer insights, agency creative talent, and production. We're applying a body of evidence assessment on advertising quality. For example the proven effective Always, Like A Girl campaign has significantly increased Always brand awareness and our equity scores. U.S. category growth rates have accelerated. And Always has built nearly 2 points of market share since the campaign began. Other brands achieving this standard of quality are many. Tide, Dawn, Febreze, Bounty, Head & Shoulders, SK-II, and Vicks. An external evaluation of our advertising has been strong. P&G received 26 creative excellence awards at Cannes in June. This is more than the next four most highly awarded competitors combined. What's noteworthy is that all of the P&G brand winners are both creative and effective at building business. For example, Tide's [Terry] Bradshaw stain Super Bowl commercial not only won multiple awards for its creative innovation across digital and live TV, it led to U.S. Tide's highest household penetration in the brand's history and contributed to share growth for the year. In-store execution is another area where we're redefining excellence to a higher standard, growing categories and our brands. This requires the right trade coverage with the right product forms, sizes, and price points, and the right in-store shelving and merchandising execution. It requires delivering against key business drivers for each category and brand in every store across all channels every day. In Brazil, we've revamped trade spending programs to reward the specific activities by brand and by channel now that are proven to drive sales. We've demonstrated the value of long-term displays of our leading brands to top retailers. These displays are high quality and clearly communicate our brand equities and product benefits. They replace in and out promotional displays that were often low quality and inefficient. We're tracking compliance versus category specific key business drivers in over 7,000 individual stores. When we get it right, category growth accelerates, our growth accelerates, and we deliver trade spending efficiencies that enable us to reinvest and improve sales coverage to achieve excellence in even more stores. We're piloting new approaches and technologies, including crowdsourcing, image recognition, and machine learning to obtain granular real-time data on store conditions to optimize our performance and coverage. The execution is working. Brazil trade promotion spending is down over 600 basis points, including the reinvestment into long term displays in-store. We're delivering these savings while reaching record value share in our largest categories, baby care, shave care, and hair care, over the past 12 months. The online shopping experience also demands executional excellence. On Amazon, Tide holds the top five search results for laundry detergent. Tide PODS are the number one best seller with over 2,000 reviews at an average rating of 4.5 points. The online execution includes video, strong performance claims, and strong value offerings for subscription options. On Walmart.com, Bounty is the number one search result for paper towels and the best seller behind strong brand content and superior performance communication. P&G e-commerce sales grew at roughly a 30% rate that Jon referred to last fiscal year, significantly outpacing off-line sales. Our e-commerce sales now are about or a little over $3 billion, larger than our top three peer competitors combined. We're committed to winning in this fast growing segment. And the last element of superior execution, but certainly not the least, is winning consumer and customer value equations. Price is one element of a winning consumer value equation. But we're really looking at the superior value of the total proposition. A product that meets a need in a noticeable and superior way with a package that is convenient to use with compelling communication, presented in a clear and shoppable way in-store. And margin is one element of the customer value equation, but so is penny profit, trip generation, basket size, and very importantly market or category growth. Our best executions generate high returns for our retail partners. Two great examples of products that are meeting all five of our superiority criteria are Dawn and Bounty. These brands delight consumers with their product performance and packaging, their promises to consumers are clear and compelling, they look great in-store and online, and they offer superior value for consumers. I can give these two examples, but these are two that many several years ago questioned that were in trouble, that had a high risk of commoditization, and a real concern that private label would take over the paper towel and hand dish category. Now I had the opportunity to work on the Dawn business when I was appointed Global Home Care President in 2007. And many think hand dishwashing detergent is a really high risk of commoditization category. Ten years later, go from 2007 to today, Dawn's value share in the U.S. has grown from 40% to 50%. And Dawn's sister brand in the UK, Fairy, has grown from 55% to around 70% value share. Superiority works. Similarly, I've had a pleasure of leading Family Care in the mid-2000s and working on the Bounty business. Paper towels are another category that people often think of as commoditized. The fact is that Bounty's technological advantages and compelling communication have kept it in the market share leader \u2013 kept it the market share leader for decades. Over the last 15 years despite many challenges from branded and private label competition, Bounty has consistently maintained or grown value share. And where do we stand against these new higher standards of noticeably superior product package and superior execution? Where a win on all five of these is required for a passing grade, we currently earn a passing grade somewhere we said in the 30%s, but we are making progress. Even over the last six months we've seen meaningful progress in the last six months in many areas, especially the product area. Two businesses where we're highly focused on improving our competitive position, our U.S. male blades and razors and China diapers. As you all know in April we took price reductions in the U.S. on male blades and razors to restore a more evenly spaced pricing ladder between our products and to cover key price points where competitors were doing most of the transactions. This was one step of several to improve overall consumer value. In May, we repositioned and relaunched Gillette Shave Care (sic) [Gillette Shave Club] (24:23), the shave club with Gillette on-demand, the new online only service that allows consumers to purchase blades whenever they want with free shipping and free of commitments or contracts. There are only two pieces of the overall plan. While it's only one quarter, North America shave care grew volume in the April/June quarter for the first time after eight consecutive quarters of volume declines. And one other example I wanted to give is China. China diapers. China is a critical country for us, and China diapers is an important opportunity to restore superiority. This is a fast growing, highly profitable category where nearly all of the growth is happening at premium price points in both the taped in the pull-on diaper forms. In January we launched a significant upgrade to Pampers Premium pull-on diapers. Starting in August, we've talked about this many times. We're launching our new Pampers Premium taped diapers. Both of these products are imported into China from Japan and carry the message of Pampers ichiban, our number one choice of Japanese hospitals, specifically designed to protect your newborn baby's delicate skin. Now to deliver superior in-store execution in the baby store channel, we've established a dedicated sales force to improve the quality of store coverage and quality of execution in these stores. We've improved consumer point of market entry awareness, trial, and retention with our Pampers Rewards program. And we've strengthened our main line taped and pull-on diaper products and packages to unify and premium-ize the total Pampers line. Establishing extending product package, execution, and value superiority represents a significant opportunity to accelerate top line growth. This will require investments to realize. As some have asked if giving lower market growth rates, category commoditization, and retail industry transformation, we should pick a different path? We have made a clear choice. We have prioritized the long-term health of the business as the key priority. In our minds, this would be \u2013 if we did the short-term profit choice, it'd be the wrong choice. In times like this we need to build advantage, not diminish it. We need to create stronger positions for our brands to drive category growth and capture a disproportionate share of that growth. To fund the investment necessary to strengthen our position and extend our advantage, we continue raising the bar on productivity. The need for investments, the external realities we face, and our historical productivity progress, and our line of sight to additional productivity opportunities all have informed our plans to save up to another $10 billion from fiscal 2017 through fiscal 2021. This will remain a focus area. An important enabler of both top line growth and productivity improvement is building our digital capabilities. This also requires investment. We're leveraging digital tools to improve the consumer experience with our brands. SK-II utilizes a proprietary beauty imaging system that has counters to analyze five dimensions of skin \u2013 texture, radiance, firmness, wrinkle resilience and the evenness of skin tone \u2013 to help women find exactly the right combination of products for them. Earlier this year Olay announced the global launch of Olay Skin Advisor, a new web-based skin analytics platform utilizing a suite of artificial intelligence technologies. And it provides women with exceptionally precise, personalized skin education and product recommendations on their mobile phones or tablets. As I mentioned earlier, we're improving in-store execution with new approaches and technologies like image recognition and machine learning to obtain real-time data on store conditions to optimize our performance and coverage. Digitization and machine learning are helping us improve the presence of our brands online. Understanding consumer behavior in areas such as digital search can help us spot important changes in trends that we can use to modify how we present our brands online. We're using digital tools to synchronize the supply network. We're working toward an ideal world where our supply chain would be fully linked to real-time point-of-sale data with consumer purchases triggering updates to our manufacturing schedules and changes to our orders of materials to our suppliers. Automation and digitization is driving productivity improvement in our manufacturing operations. For example, in our Mariscala, Mexico, plant, we've increased productivity 60% over the past four years. About half of that improvement is driven by digitization programs and work process improvements. And the other half is related to automation projects like palletizing robots, automated guided vehicles, and automated bottle sorting. Digital tools are making our office work more efficient. In our internal audit organization we're using desktop auditing and data analytics to focus resources on the highest impact transactions in processes, enabling us to reduce staffing while also reducing risk for our company. In addition to establishing a new standard of excellence for product performance, packaging, and commercial execution, and continued to drive significant cost savings, we're further strengthening our organization design, culture, and accountability. Deeper mastery, closer to consumers and customers, more agile, more accountable, more efficient, and more effective. We discussed many of our ideas at the analyst meeting last fall and at CAGNY. And we've acted on all of them. We continue to move resources out of global or corporate roles into regions and countries, learning from, innovating for, and serving local consumers. Today, a small percentage of commercial function employees, including general management, marketing, sales, and finance, occupy global roles. Global category leadership who own end-to-end global profit and loss statements are geographically dispersed. These few central resources add value by driving scale of manufacturing platforms, ensuring consistency of global brand equities, and ensuring pricing strategies work across regions. Regional commercial resources own regional profit and loss statements, coordinating innovation across our pipelines and set the pricing and promotion strategy. The large majority of marketing, sales, and finance people reside in local markets, executing innovation, advertising, and merchandising programs, leveraging unique local knowledge of consumers, customers, and competitors. In 2013, we worked with an outside consultant on an external benchmarking study to compare P&G by functional spending as percent of sales against a set of peer companies. This informed choice is to improve. Function spending as a percent of sales is now on average below the meeting of our benchmark group. And it's approaching or ahead of the top quartile benchmark in about half the cases. Our targeted spending by function in 2020 is well below or below the median in every function, better than the top quartile benchmark 50% of the time with some choices to reinvest in functions like R&D and sales. One specific targeted reduction in the corporate spending area is we continue to redirect resources into the business units to get them closer to the end consumer. Over the last five years we've reduced corporate roles by 20% with plans to go further. We've eliminated central resources where they've added complexity but didn't provide a scale benefit overall. We've kept some centralized work where it does provide a scale benefit in areas like corporate accounting, tax, treasury. In large markets we're implementing what we call an end-to-end ownership and accountability approach. This new model gives regional category business leaders, who own full profit and loss responsibilities, holistic decision-making authorities, starting with the front end of innovation all the way through to the consumer. Each category decides the resources they need to win. Category is the point of competition. It's the point at which consumers engage with our brands. We first implemented this end-to-end approach, giving category leaders full responsibility in the front end of innovation all the way through to the store, in the United States in fiscal 2016. We brought four more markets in the model in fiscal 2017 and are adding five more markets this year. In total, our end-to-end markets will account for around 70% of company sales. In smaller countries where we don't have scale to organize in a dedicated end-to-end model, we're implementing a new what we call freedom within a framework approach. The objective is to enable these smaller markets to be faster and more agile. As long as the market is executing within the predefined strategies and is delivering the financial target set by the region, they have the freedom to make real time decisions without the need to engage regional or global resources. In the markets where we've tested this approach, it's enabled us to cut the number of internal review meetings in half, reduce the number of people participating in meetings, and importantly enhance agility and market responsiveness. We're launching the freedom within a framework approach in relevant markets globally right now. We're challenging talent development and career planning \u2013 we're changing talent development and career planning to drive more mastery and depth in each of our product categories. The objective is simple. Improve business results by getting and keeping the right people in the right places to develop and apply deep category mastery to win. P&G is fortunate to consistently source and develop very strong talent. But there are times when the best talent for a role may not be within our organization. We are supplementing internal development with hiring from the outside to add the skill and experience needed to win and field the best teams. Our external hiring has roughly quadrupled across five different levels of management, including senior line leadership. Since 2015 we've added external hires to the position of Personal Healthcare Vice President, Chief Information Officer, Chief Information Security Officer, Head of Corporate Communications, and Global Media Director with additional searches underway. We are actively working to create a culture of appropriate risk taking and are aligning incentives at a lower level of granularity to better match responsibilities and to increase accountability. We're quadrupling the number of bonus units from 25 to over 100 to more appropriately align compensation to results delivered. Related to this change, business leaders now have the discretion to adjust awards within their bonus units, based on the specific performance versus being paid based on uniform formulas. Sales professionals in our largest markets, who are now dedicated to selling one product category, have the majority of their incentive comp tied to the performance of that category versus what was previously a region average across all categories. Category leaders per region now have their incentive composition tied to the performance of their category in their region, versus the global average for that category. Bottom line, again we're committed to getting, keeping, and growing the right people in the right places, dedicated to categories to drive better business results. We're putting more granular incentives in place to match the increased end-to-end responsibility we're asking leaders to assume. We're leveraging this talent and mastery in an organization designed to get the best of both focus and agility at the point of competition in categories and markets, along with the benefits of P&G's scale and cost advantages in areas like global business services, purchasing, tax, treasury, and supply network efficiency. Advantages that none of our individual businesses or sectors could achieve on their own. We believe that these three areas that I've talked about this morning, irresistible products and package superiority, coupled with superior commercial execution, fueled by strong productivity improvement and cost savings, and supported by an organization that is experienced, agile, accountable, and committed to win, will enable us to continue to make progress and accelerate that progress even in the challenging market conditions we currently face. Now I want to hand it back to Jon for a few minutes to discuss the fiscal 2018 guidance. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: As context for guidance, I think it's helpful to look briefly at the macro environment we currently face as we enter the new fiscal year. The markets in which we compete, as I said earlier, are growing at around 2.5% to 3%, including an estimate for non-track channels. Currencies and commodities continue to be volatile. Political and economic disruptions continue to have a large impact on markets. Policy changes, such as the goods and services tax implementation on India, will put pressure on sales growth. Many other policy unknowns still exist, such as healthcare and tax reforms in the U.S. and execution of Brexit, which could impact consumers and the company. Net, we continue to face a slow growth volatile world. We're also investing, as David discussed, in our future. Each of these is factored into fiscal 2018 guidance ranges. We're currently expecting organic sales growth of 2% to 3%, an incremental improvement versus fiscal 2017. This estimate includes about a quarter point of headwind from the portfolio cleanup in the ongoing businesses. It also includes the headwind from the price adjustment on the U.S. blades and razors business made late last fiscal year. Both of these headwinds will have their biggest impact in the first half of the year and will annualize as the year progresses. We expect 2018 all-in sales growth of around 3%. This includes a zero to half point net benefit from the combination of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestitures and the impact of the India goods and services tax implementation. Our bottom line guidance is for core earnings per share growth of 5% to 7%. Within this and very importantly, we expect core operating profit growth of 5% to 6%, essentially triple the 2% core operating profit growth result in fiscal 2017. We expect a net impact of interest expense, interest income, and other nonoperating income to be a 1- to 2-point headwind on fiscal 2018 core earnings per share growth. We estimate the core effective tax rate will be around 24%, roughly in line with the fiscal 2017 rate. Share count will be an earnings per share benefit of about 2 percentage points due to discrete share repurchase and the carryover benefit from the Beauty transaction share exchange executed last October. We plan to deliver another year of 90% or better free cash flow productivity. This includes CapEx in the range of 5% to 5.5% of sales. We'll continue our strong track record of cash return to shareholders. We increased our dividend as I said earlier for the 61st consecutive year in April. We expect to pay nearly $7.5 billion in dividends and repurchase $4 billion to $7 billion of our shares in fiscal 2018. Foreign exchange and M&A could have a notable impact on the ultimate level of share repurchase. As we manage the balance sheet to full capacity of our AA-minus credit rating, our share repurchase range is highly sensitive to currency fluctuations, particularly the euro. Given our euro debt balances, every 5% euro appreciation to the dollar reduces share repurchase capacity by about $1 billion. Likewise, if we were to make an acquisition we would adjust our share repurchase to maintain our credit metrics. At current rates and prices, FX is a modest help to fiscal 2018 earnings and commodities are about a $200 million after-tax headwind. Significant currency weakness, commodity cost increases, or additional geopolitical disruptions are not anticipated within this guidance range. Finally, as you consider the quarterly profile of your sales and earnings estimate, please note that the July/September period is the most difficult top line comparison of the year. Underlying market growth was notably stronger in the first half of last fiscal year versus the market we're operating in right now. July shipments have been relatively weak, consistent with the market level data you've seen and reported. Topline headwinds from the portfolio choices and the Gillette price intervention will be focused on the front half of the year and will annualize as the year progresses. Also keep in mind that productivity savings will build as we progress through the year. As a result, we expect the first quarter to be our lowest organic sales and core earnings per share growth period of fiscal 2018. With that I'll hand it back to David for brief closing comments. David S. Taylor - Procter & Gamble Co.: As we close fiscal 2017 and enter fiscal 2018, we are where we expected to be. We're making sequential progress. And we're raising the bar in everything we do. We'll measure our progress in years, not quarters. We'll continue to make the needed reinvestment in innovation, brand building, and go-to-market to position P&G well over the next three years, five years, seven years and beyond. We're raising the bar to a higher standard of performance, irresistibly superior products and packaging, coupled with superior commercial execution, fueled by strong cost savings and continued strengthening of our organization and culture. This will lead to balanced growth and value creation and winning the total shareholder return. The plans we've put in action are delivering improvement. We are accelerating our efforts. And it takes time to do it right. Achieving our objectives will not only require continued focus as an organization, but also that we prevent anything from derailing the work that is delivering improvement. Winning results matter. They matter to our employees, retirees, and stakeholders. They matter to you, our share owners. Winning results happen because we earn them every day, every week, every month, every quarter, and every year in every brand and every country in which we compete. We're committed to win. And we'll do it within our purpose, values, and principles, which have guided P&G for 180 years. We know this is increasingly important to many of our consumers, share owners, and stake holders, who are interested in ensuring our actions and values are worthy of their trust. And as a global corporate citizen we have a responsibility to ensure that our business operations positively impact consumers in the broader world. We'll always do it the right way with integrity and with competitive passion. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: Before we begin the Q&A portion of the call, I just want to remind you that the purpose of today's call is to discuss fourth quarter and fiscal year performance and the progress we're making through the execution of our strategy. We'd like to as much as possible keep our conversation focused on those topics. And with that we'll open it up. Operator : Thank you, sir. Your first question comes from the line of Stephen Powers with UBS. Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC : Great, thanks. David, from the results this quarter and your outlook, it seems like you feel like you've turned a corner and are starting to build \u2013 rebuild momentum, which is truly great. And it leads to a question, what you think it will take to accelerate that momentum further? Which you started to answer with your discussion of the drive toward sustained superiority. But I was listening to you and thinking \u2013 and asking this question with two thoughts in mind. One is that it feels like more and more superior innovation is occurring on the fringes of the industry, as opposed to inside big incumbent operations. And two, which you started to touch upon, is that it feels like much of that new innovation is truly digitally enabled at its core. And together those imply that companies like P&G need to rapidly retool to keep pace, either by investing a lot in new training and toolsets, going out and hiring for those capabilities. Or else choosing to bolt on the capabilities through M&A or creative licensing, JVs, that kind of thing. What's your reaction to those observations? And do you feel like you can truly retool quickly enough on an organic basis? Or is there a case to be made that you should look outside to even a greater degree than you already have been, either in the form of hiring, acquiring new technologies, or to Jon's comments on M&A, bolting on new complementary brands altogether? Thanks. David S. Taylor - Procter & Gamble Co.: I think the answer to that is it's a both/and. And that there's no question in my mind that we can accelerate growth on our core brands. And one of the things that I want to address is at times I keep hearing that big brands can't grow. If I look at my top 10 global brands, these billion dollar brands, nine of the 10 grew nicely the last year. Eight of the 10 grew faster than the company's average that we just reported, which is nice growth in this environment. So there's no question that strong innovation on existing big brands can grow. Head & Shoulders has been one of our best successes for years. It had another 5% growth this year. Oral-B brand grew at high single digits. You just got a number of examples. Having said that, I think you make very good points. And one thing you said, we need to increase looking outside or considering external hires. I think in many ways people underestimate how much we already do connecting with the outside and the number of conversations we're having and things that we're doing in some of our upstream innovation programs. The reality is, it's going to be both. We can and will innovate on our big brands. They are what drove the strong progress this year. They grew bigger than \u2013 faster than the balance of the company. And at the same time we are investing in \u2013 to use your term \u2013 retooling rapidly in terms of making sure we have the right skills, capabilities, and people, which is why we have increased the number of external hires. We're increasing our connections with many entrepreneurs. And I think you are aware, and we've talked before, we have both the P&G Ventures group that's looking for both existing and new spaces to play, but with new technologies as well as some internal VC capability we've been working to develop. So I think it's a both/and. And yes, I believe that can be done. And I believe the progress we're making, we just need to stay focused and not get distracted and go hard on this path. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: And to your point on acquisitions, Steve. I think that increasingly, the how to win aspect of strategy will be part of our lens as we're looking at potential acquisitions, which we'll continue to do. So that is also part of the toolbox. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning, guys. So, Jon, first just a detail question. Can you give us a bit more clarity on how weak organic sales growth could be in Q1, given your July comments? Is a flash order (47:40) possible? And was there any timing benefit in Q4 that will come out of Q1? And then the broader question, which is also around top line. Conceptually you guys have really been pointing to fiscal 2018 as the year where you sort of get back on track form an organic sales growth standpoint. Most of the large organizational changes are in place, the SKU discontinuations drop off, you have the out-sized spending behind the Coty and Duracell share count benefit, and now also you've got the benign comparison with the abnormal external issues you cited around the world today, Jon, and the retail inventory cuts in the U.S. over this last fiscal year. So given all those factors, why do you only expect 2% to 3% organic sales growth in fiscal 2018? And does that really signal that the ultimate payoff from all these areas is unlikely to move P&G above that 2% to 3% range longer term? I guess to put it simply, are you now a structurally lower top line growth company, more in that 2% to 3% range? Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: So I'll give you a point of view on the second point. But I'm sure David will have some thoughts there as well. Relative to Q1, I don't expect it \u2013 I expect growth in Q1. But that growth to be very modest, given all the dynamics that we've talked about. In terms of growth next year, 2% to 3% represents acceleration from the year that we were just in, in a period where market growth if it stays at today's levels is going to be lower than it was over that whole period. And that 2% to 3% effectively straddles what we expect market growth to be. Our objective is to build market share within that. And to the extent that market growth rebounds or is stronger, I would expect our results to reflect that. Longer term, my personal view is that there are significant opportunities for growth that remain. We've talked before about increasing populations and increasing income, increase of middle income households. We're going to see a bigger increase in those drivers of consumer products business in the next decade, albeit with some turbulence, then likely we've ever seen before. We have significant household penetration opportunities, David alluded to in his remarks, on winning products. Only 4% of washes in the U.S. using beads. Only \u2013 household penetration of the unit-dose detergents, only 23%. So I do think that there's a future of growth strongly in front of us. I don't think that it's realistic to expect that we're going to grow orders of magnitude faster than the overall market however. David? David S. Taylor - Procter & Gamble Co.: The only thing I'd add to that is I clearly see the company having the capability to grow ahead of the market over time, we're within the head (50:40) of the market just as Jon said. And no, I do not believe we're structurally a slower growing company. I think if anything, the things that we've done over the last several years have positioned us to be more agile and more able to take advantage of new opportunities in markets. And the changes we're making in our innovation capability also give me confidence that we can now see some of those opportunities better than we may have been able to in the past. The combination of the lean innovation in all 10 categories that is starting to pay off and over time I think will build capability, along with the investments we're making in new jobs to be done, which has opened up some new problem areas \u2013 or places we can play that I think will be additive to what we've been doing over the last several years. And then this new, and it's very early, some of the work we're doing with some small problem spaces that have very large addressable markets, gives me a lot of belief that there's a bright future. So if anything, I'm more excited. And I think this year was a really challenging year to make the progress we did through the year. And the organization is very quickly learning to get from very structured to a very flexible, agile, accountable organization. Small teams, learn, pivot, learn, act. And to me that just tells me we're actually well-positioned. And you've seen and we've referred to in our remarks, we're doing very well in the online space, which is rapidly growing, both with pure plays and existing bricks and mortar that are really turning into effective omni retailers. And P&G is working very effectively across all channels. But we've opened up our field of vision to see \u2013 to be many more opportunities. And we're organizing our company to be able to take advantage of them. So I'm actually quite excited about what the future holds. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citi Research. Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. Two questions. The first one on grooming if I may. With the price cut you took, your margins have come way down. And I'm just wondering specifically to the grooming business, what is going to take those margins back up over time? Because that's been such a margin accretive segment for you relative to the overall business. I'm just wondering if that's been a permanent reset? Or if there are specific things you can do outside of taking prices back up that'll make that more profitable? And then second of all, just quickly, David, on your comment about benchmarking. Clearly you benchmarked yourself relative to peers and other companies with regard to your cost structure. But have you done benchmarking with regard to your speed-to-market or time-to-market? Because when we were in China recently, we were so impressed by what we heard about the diaper launch. It looks like it's set up to be incredibly impactful, fingers crossed. But it also feels like it's taken a really long time to get to market. And listening to you talk about how much work, all the research, all that kind of stuff that you're doing, it feels like there's maybe a risk that there's sort of paralysis of analysis or something. But maybe that's an unfair characterization. So can you comment on that? Thanks. David S. Taylor - Procter & Gamble Co.: Sure, Wendy. Let me hit both of them. First, on grooming. To me the path to build the business, both in sales and profits, is to bring users back in and then to have products in each of the ladders that consumers see as better. And so they move up the ladder. The trade up model works. We've seen it over a long period of time. What we did not do as good a job as we needed to in the U.S. is bringing new users in. And so we lost a lot of household penetration. We weren't planning to keep price points. And we had reduced our spending on some of the point of market entry programs. We made a big investment, some of it in price, some of it in the point of market entry programs. And you saw the volume response. And we'll see over the next year as we continue to invest in bringing users in. And then we'll do what we know how to do, which is once one gets into one of the various places you can enter the Gillette franchise, we'll work to then expose them to better options and higher performing options. And trade up is the best way to build margins over time. And frankly, as you move people from disposables into systems and then into \u2013 more frequent use of cartridges, good things happen. So yeah. And we \u2013 because we're seeing it in other parts of the world. The U.S. is particularly challenged because of a set of dynamics we've talked, where we had missing rungs in our price ladder. You can look at other parts of the world, and it's continuing to perform very well. So again I see the grooming business as attractive. We've got work to do. And this year will be a challenging year. And we've been very open about it, and we're addressing it. On the speed question. We are actually in many ways getting faster. And it depends on what dimension you look at. When you look at things that require capital expenditures and building capacity, it does take time. Your cutting metal and putting equipment in place. In the case of baby care, the design of the product may be done relatively quick. But then having the capacity to make them perfectly a few hundred million times, you have to have equipment and you have to have a process and you have to have material supply. And that for us and many does take time. And if anything we're getting much more efficient in that, as we've done our end-to-end work on synchronizing our supply chain. Where we can and are getting much faster is on things that aren't heavy capital investments, packaging changes, and other formulation changes. And some of the new platforms give us much better agility. And when I talk about the number of different research tools \u2013 and I'll reference a meeting I'll have later this week, which is we can do research in days and weeks and months, not quarters and years. So many of these tools are ones where you don't have to go out and place a large based research at a mall and bring people back weeks later. We've done online today, and I'll have the read on Monday. And you can act on Tuesday. And that's what we're getting to is leveraging the digital ecosystem to access large groups of consumers, learn, pivot, learn, pivot, and then act. When you get into cutting metal, yes, it takes longer. And we're working on simplifying that part of the system as well. But we clearly have internalized the need to have a flexible, agile, and much faster organization and upping the accountability while we do that. Operator : And your next question comes from the line Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. So I wanted to test some of your energized and eloquent prepared remarks versus some data from your results. So the first one \u2013 two things. The first one is despite you sort of under emphasizing lower price as a tool, if you look at your results on a category-by-category basis, you've decided to either take prices down, like grooming, oral care, baby, or raise prices now that you've seen some results less than your key competitors. So for a company like yours that says it's intent on growing the category, certainly in innovation, understanding it's not always premiumization, but innovation. Why that strategy? How do you think your competitors will respond? And is this a good sustainable strategy going forward? I guess the underlying question I always have is, how much are you to blame for the category slowdown? And then the second point is, to quote you, David, from your prepared remarks. If your standards are high, if you want to be the best, why is it that you set this target, and I think get paid on the target, of only performing in the top third of peers, when you have so many advantages? You're going through this great transformation. And frankly, you've historically done much better than that. You've really historically done much better than your peers. Why is that not the case now? Why this one-third? Thanks for both of those. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: Well, let me just provide some data as it relates to the first question. And then David can talk more about the approach and the thinking. If you look at price as a component of top line growth, to this notion that broadly on aggregate we're leading prices down. Price was neutral as an element of top line growth for both the quarter and the year. It's been neutral to positive for 27 consecutive quarters and 12 consecutive years. So the notion that we're leading pricing down on a broad basis isn't consistent with the data. We will, as we need to be competitive and to address the point of winning value equations, make moves as we need to. But generally the direction again is not student body down. David S. Taylor - Procter & Gamble Co.: And just I guess a couple comments on the top third. I think performing and delivering results in the top third over time through ups and downs is a very good place to be for our company. It means you're one of the best amongst the very best in your industry across the world. You're competing with a number of competitors that are domiciled in different countries over time. And at the same time we've made a commitment and certainly we've delivered consistent returns to shareholders via dividends. And we've got a pretty good track record of increasing the dividend. So the idea of having a company that you can count on over time \u2013 and this is why I think it's a good goal \u2013 that delivers very good total shareholder return in the form of appreciation and cash return to shareholders is a very good objective. And I think our share owners will be rewarded as we deliver that. And that's what we're working very hard to get back to the top third and then stay there over time. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: One other thing, Ali, and the group on pricing and on understanding what's happening in the marketplace. As we've talked before, we're in a little bit of a difficult environment for you to effectively assess what's really happening. And I just want to address that for a second. And that's because we have our pricing strategy. But the ultimate price that consumers pay is at the sole discretion of our retail partners. And that's what you're picking up in the scanner data and the Nielsen data that you see. And so there are instances where if you look at period to period or versus year ago price moves, it would appear that a price reduction has occurred. In many, many cases that's not us reducing that price. So just a little bit technical. But I wanted to make sure I registered that point. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. I'd like to talk a little bit about implementation of end-to-end. I think in North America we're kind of at a two-year point for that being put in place. And I understand it was the lead markets, there was going to be a lot of learning and adjusting. But it looks like you're still \u2013 share trends are still clearly not where they need to be in the U.S. So two years in, could you maybe talk a little bit about what's worked? What's been tougher than you thought? If there have been sort of impediments to seeing changed behavior and people understanding that they've got that autonomy and ability to do things differently? I think just a real time kind of status report two years in, where numerically it's not clicking, but that doesn't mean it's not the right direction to move in. Thanks. David S. Taylor - Procter & Gamble Co.: Yeah. It's a fair question. First, I'm very convinced end-to-end is a much more effective and agile operating model, because it has a very clear choice on how you're going to organize. And the G view or (1:02:48) the regional business unit that runs in North America today has line of sight and now has \u2013 and it's increasing over time, building the capability to understand the consumer, build a relationship with the customer, and building category mastery. And take North America, the U.S. and Canada. And we've had a little more challenges in the U.S. this year because of a lot of well-documented things that are going on in the marketplace. And I think if you see not only us, many other competitors, our results still are making progress. What I see \u2013 I just came from Canada yesterday. I spent a day in the market. A year ago or 18 months ago we had 30% of our brands growing share. Today we have 60% of our brands growing share. I didn't hear one comment around part of the organization saying, you need to help with another part of the organization. There was a very clear focus on addressing either consumer or a customer challenge that is existing in the marketplace. Or how to best execute a new initiative coming. The effectiveness of the current organization is meaningfully better. And I do believe it will show over time, strong results. We've got a couple big issues that we're addressing in the U.S. The biggest is probably the Gillette issue. It weighs pretty heavy on the market. We're going to have to work through that and annualize that. And a couple other categories that we have some long standing issues that we're working through. We've talked in the past about skin. We've talked in the past about some of the things on hair. And one by one we're addressing those. Head & Shoulders is growing, Herbal Essences is showing progress. We still got work to do on Pantene. So again making progress, but not yet where we want to be in all the businesses. And the other thing, it's a very competitive market with not only a lot of competitors but also some pretty dynamic things happening on the retail front. But from an organization standpoint, I clearly see improved operation. And I clearly see the effectiveness we hoped to see on the way we work. And now it's got to translate \u2013 and I believe it will over time \u2013 to more consistent strong results. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: And to that point, while there's still more work to do, about two-thirds of our U.S. sales base is holding or growing share currently. That compares to 50% a year ago. So again continued improvement. Pretty strong volume progress in the year we just completed in the U.S. at 2%. 4% in the quarter we just completed. So as David rightly said, work still to do. But we are seeing that sustained improvement. David S. Taylor - Procter & Gamble Co.: And the other market just, Lauren, to make a comment, that we started a little while back and is part way into it, is China. And it's another one where the breadth is a really good indication. We had two categories growing share \u2013 or growing sales even 18 months ago. And now we've got six. In the last quarter another one went, so seven of the 10. We were minus five in 2015/2016. We're plus one in 2016/2017. And other than baby that we've been very open about, it was plus four. So you've seen a meaningful change. And again when I'm there, what you see is the category, one, having the decision space to move at the speed of the market. And secondly, you see choices being made the wouldn't have been made several years ago. The Baby Care is a good example. The end-to-end team there on Baby Care said, I've got to cover the baby channel. I'm going to need to hire 100 people or get distributors to cover. The decision was made by the category, yes. Yes mode has helped to execute it, acquired the people and developed the capability, and it's happening. Though minus five to plus one in a tough market, plus four ex-baby, that's a really good indication volume is up in the U.S. And then Canada doubling the percent of the business growing share. Those are indications. And certainly the behavior I see gives me a lot of confidence. This is one of the parts that really is working. And over time I think it'll play out in more consistent strong results. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: And just for completeness. It was implied in David's comments, but China was one of the four markets that we went end-to-end in last year. David S. Taylor - Procter & Gamble Co.: Yes. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: So that, the result does reflect that choice. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yeah. Thanks, good morning, everyone. David, thanks for providing the color you did on how P&G has enhanced the way that it evaluates new products in the pipeline. But I was hoping you can share some context on if you've made any changes on how you actually source or ideate around those products or around the innovation pipeline? So in terms of how you actually come up with the concepts, versus actually evaluating the concepts? If you can provide some context, that would be helpful. David S. Taylor - Procter & Gamble Co.: I'll just give you a couple comments, and again there's a pretty wide range by category. But we have certainly all the traditional measures. But we now are accessing many more external ideas than before in that all of the businesses in the latitude to both work with internal stake holders, but also to look at and engage where they see either technologies or even potentially other opportunities to add that are outside our company. Until something happens, we certainly wouldn't announce it. But as both I've mentioned and Jon has mention, we'll be active managers of the portfolio. And so ideas are coming both inside and outside. The ideation to me is broad. The spaces that we're innovating are more. And then the path to kind of whittle down lots of ideas to what's right for the market to me is getting faster. All those things I feel very good about. The part that I think is though absolutely important to reinforce is growing the core and building on the core is what will give us the momentum that I think we'll all be pleased with. And then adding to that. And that's why both the front-end innovation that we're doing within our categories, where we're using this lean innovation approach, which is generating a lot of ideas. Once you identify a problem, we source a lot of ideas and then can go through them much faster. But then we've added this PGV, P&G Ventures, and this additional corporate capability that's looking at new spaces that aren't in the 10 categories that are sourcing ideas, that then can be put in the category if it's adjacent or pursued independently. So we're not suffering for lack of ideas. And now the challenge is to process and then learn enough to develop models. The other thing \u2013 the last thing I'll say on this is we have several transaction learning tests going on. Some have been public, many are not, where we're trying new things as well. So again the number of both ideas and spaces, neat spaces that we're playing in is robust. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you. Just getting back to the outlook. Going from 2% to 2% to 3%. It sounds like macros market growth, more or less in line with where it's been. So do you have more initiatives hitting the market? Or an expectation for a better hit rate on the plans that you have? So I guess a better understanding of the key things embedded in your expectations as you look for that acceleration. And then clearly this was a better than anticipated quarter and quite a bit better than your peers. So I guess how do you ensure consistency in growth over time so that you don't fall back into this cycle of kind of ups and downs, booms and busts, especially given all the dynamics in the market right now? There's heavier competition. There's retail pressures that you talked about. Still somewhat shaky macros in emerging markets and things like that. Thank you. David S. Taylor - Procter & Gamble Co.: A guess a couple things on why do we think we'll grow from here in shaky macros. And there's no question the environment is difficult right now. But we've got many, many pieces of evidence that when we get the innovation right, it works. One of the areas that's big enough to mention is Baby Care China. Getting that right will make an enormous difference. We had and have had several years of well below market growth on a category that's growing above 110%. And so when we launch \u2013 and certainly we'll work hard to earn share growth in that category \u2013 that's going to move several points to China and will be meaningful to the company. We've got a few other areas. When we annualize the Gillette investment, that is meaningful. On the top of that, we've made some choices that are in the base this year, that Jon had referred to in previous remarks, that we will be annualizing. We decided to get out of some pieces of businesses that just did not look profitable and would not create value over time. The powders business, laundry powder business in Brazil. We'll annualize that as we end this calendar year. So it's the absence of some of the negatives. And several of the innovations need to hit. Baby Care is one of them, addressing Gillette. We have some very exciting innovation coming on skin care and hair care. And one of the encouraging points is some of the early work in China. Olay grew in the back half of our fiscal year for the first time in a long time in China, which is to me a nice leading indicator of the work we're doing both in-store, the way we present the brand, the packaging changes that have been made, and some of the new innovation that's hitting. So I look at some of the categories that have been drags, and we've got really strong plans. I fully expect them to be highly competitive categories in difficult macro environment. But I think we can earn improved growth from where we are today. And we'll continue to push on, making sure that we're agile enough to address to whatever happens in the external world. The organization is certainly better prepared to deal with whatever comes at them with the accountability clear and more decisions based closer to the consumer. So I think we're well positioned to deal with a pretty volatile world. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: And just a couple of pieces of mathematical perspective if you will. I'm encouraged by a couple things. One is that the 2% growth we delivered in the quarter ends a 2% growth for the year. And so it's not just one quarter we've been growing at that rate. We delivered over 2% growth and within that as we talked, there's a half a point of portfolio cleanup. And the Gillette pricing that David talked about had about a 30 basis point impact on the total company. You add something like addressing the China diaper situation, which David just talked about, and pretty soon \u2013 and I certainly don't want to talk our numbers up. But pretty soon you're at 3% just with that math. Now as David rightly said, as those things go right, we will have some things that'll go wrong and we'll be dealing with the challenges that our world faces. But I feel pretty comfortable with the behavioral changes that David talked about, the product strengthening that we spent both last call and this call talking about, and the annualization of some of the headwinds. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust. William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. Just to follow up on the grooming. I think you'd said, David, that you did see volume growth for the first time in nine quarters. But I guess is that \u2013 was the level of growth what you were looking for? And I mean do you expect it to accelerate as we kind of move through the year? And I'm just trying to understand. So far I realize it's only two months, three months into it. Have you gotten what you thought out of this? And would you look to do anything like this to any other categories around the world? Or is this really just very, very specific? David S. Taylor - Procter & Gamble Co.: Okay, Bill, let me just give a couple quick comments. And I'll try to address that last one, which is much broader. The answer to, did we get what we expected in AMJ [April/May/June] in the U.S.? The answer is yes. The volume response was as we modeled, maybe a little bit better actually. But it's early. And so I'm not going to for a second declare victory. We don't even have the full plan in the market. We had part of it executed, certainly the price change at some of our major customers did drop. But there's additional actions that will take place over this six months to go ahead and get the rest of the plan in the market, the portfolio right, the packaging right, and the go-to-market programs. We couldn't affect all of that immediately. The one we could do quickest is the price change to address some of the points on the ladder that were missing. So we're in early stages of a very important investment in a very important category. And I can't predict what'll happen, but I can tell you that the early indications are positive. The fact that the user growth is back up, the volume is moving up, and we're getting very good support from our retail partners. They see the opportunity. And they also understand Gillette is the only one that can build value in this category. Gillette is the only one that has a history over time of creating value in this category. So getting it right. Getting the consumers back in. I won't try to predict societal trends. There's other things that do play in the results in any quarter, six months, or even year. But what we want, if we can bring more consumers in, and they see and appreciate the superior experience you have with Gillette, no matter where you come in relative to the best alternative in that price tier, then I think we're well-positioned to win over time. And we do see consumers trade up, because there are meaningful advantages as you move up from a two-blade disposable to a Mach and a Mach to a Fusion, ProGlide and then ProShield. So yes, we're making good progress. And it's very early days. This can be better addressed probably in the early part of calendar 2018 after we had six months and get the full plan in place. The second question, will we have to do something like this on other brands? We will have to, one, understand where the consumers go, and then secondly, the market will change. What's clear today, and we've now got much better early warning systems out there, is there will be many competitive actions, small from small and large companies. And I think we're doing a better job seeing those. And in many times \u2013 and there's many of those. Many will not be big threats, some will be. But what we need to do is cover spaces where consumers or shoppers go. And that includes channels and benefit areas. Each of the 10 categories now are designing an organization that's better in touch in the big markets with what's going on. I think we'll catch many of them earlier. And if we really do our job right, we create the new trends, because our innovation is ahead of where the consumers see the need. We provide an opportunity that they really like. And again I think the organization design and the agility and accountability I'm now seeing tells me we're at least better positioned to deal with a volatile world. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Thank you. So given your strong performance in the first quarter, how are you thinking about retailers' willingness to build inventory levels again? Do think the large destocking that you've seen through fiscal 2017 is largely behind you at this point? And then if you \u2013 in your organic growth guidance you mentioned the back end loaded given the tough comp in the first quarter. Is that primarily because you were seeing the international trends getting better? Or the comp being tougher in the first quarter? So if you can break down EM and DM embedded in your guidance. And related to that in terms of your spending to grow. In terms of thinking \u2013 as embedded in your guidance also for fiscal year 2018, it's pretty conservative in my view in terms of how you're going to spend \u2013 you're going to have the trade spend funded into more rational add spend. So what you saw here in the fourth quarter was like you cut and then quoted as temporary. So can you help us bridge this guidance in terms of SG&A spend as well? Thank you so much. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: Sure. First of all in terms of retail inventories, I mean we're working hard with our retail partners to ensure availability on shelf. Within that we're very supportive of lower inventories systemically across the value chain. And a number of our product supply initiatives are designed to enable both ourselves and our retail partners to carry lower inventories. So we're not expecting a big acceleration in inventories that retailers are currently holding. But we're going to continue to work on availability at shelf. Some of our supply initiatives have enabled us to increase that significantly. In North America as an example, where we've gone to the mixing centers, we now have about 80% of our product line we can get to a store shelf within 24 hours of an order. And as a result, our customer service levels have improved significantly, getting close to 98%, 99% levels of service. On the spending question. We've talked about the need to invest in product, package, communication, shelf, and occasionally in the value equation. So you should assume that we're going to do that. In the fourth quarter the reduction in marketing that occurred was almost all in the digital space. And what it reflected was a choice to cut spending from a digital standpoint where it was ineffective. Where either we were serving bots as opposed to human beings. Or where the placement of ads was not facilitating the equity of our brands. Importantly, as we made those decisions and put our money where our mouth has been in terms of the need to increase the efficiency of that supply chain, ensure solid and strong placement of individual ads, we didn't see a reduction in the growth rate. So as you know we delivered over 2% organic sales growth on 2% volume growth in the quarter. And that, what that tells me is that that spending that we cut was largely ineffective. What we'd love to do, and what we're working with our media partners to do, is create a very efficient supply chain that helps us build our brands. And we'd love to invest more in doing just that. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning. You guys mentioned some interest in M&A this morning. But this would really be the first time in years that you've purchased something, since you've really been in selling and consolidating mode. So I'd love it if you could drill down a little further on why now? And then why you would only look to acquire \u2013 or would you only look to acquire something in your existing categories? Or would you be willing to expand into another category? And then maybe finally, if you could just remind us of your criteria for acquisitions, that would be helpful. Thanks. David S. Taylor - Procter & Gamble Co.: Why don't I give a comment or two, and then Jon will add a comment. First, we went through \u2013 you're absolutely right. We went through a very big process the last several years going from almost 200 brands down to 65. But what we said, and we really mean it, is when we closed on October 1 the Coty deal, all 10 categories needed to be in a position to grow. They needed to deliver results and grow. And it starts with very strong organic growth, building from the base. And I think we've got really good evidence that that is possible when you see the top 10 brands driving your growth and growing above the market, which is good evidence that we're starting to see our innovation programs working. On top of that, I think it makes perfect sense, and we've made the decision to say we'll be active managers. So all 10 of the presidents, as well as the company looking at spaces outside the 10 core categories that we're active. Now we won't do anything until we see something that we think can create value and leverages the core capabilities of this company. We've learned a lot with the process, the round trip that we went through over the last 15 years on buying another \u2013 a number of brands and companies and selling them. So part of the things \u2013 part of the screen that we used is learning from what worked and didn't work. But clearly we see the opportunity to acquire potentially new technologies, capabilities, or potentially companies in spaces that are in our existing 10 core categories, are adjacent, or ones that leverage our capabilities. That is active today for the company. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: And there will be a couple other screens that we \u2013 that would complement that search. And to the extent that we can be in categories and that can be beyond the 10 categories that we're currently operating in, where daily \u2013 where products are consumed daily or even more than one time per day. Those are categories we really like. Categories where a product is used or consumed once or twice or three times a year are not as attractive by definition. We want to be in categories where product superiority matters. Where purchase motivation is driven by the ability of a product to meet a need in a demonstrable way. It's not that they're bad businesses. But a large part of the choice in businesses we got out of was that purchase intent was driven by something other than that. Fashion, flavors, fragrance, self-image, all good things, but not up our power alley. So we're going to stay, as David said, very focused on the kinds of things that we know we can do well in. But there are lots of those. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thank you for squeezing me in. I've got two questions. And I'm just going to kind of spew them out, because I know I don't get a second chance. First, I wanted to understand guidance and the implicit reinvestment into next year. I think you said around 5% to 7% bottom line, 2 points is share repo, getting us to a sort of 3% to 5% pre-tax on 3% growth. That doesn't imply much margin especially in context of I think you said, commodities post-tax only $200 million. That's kind of benign for a company your size. So is it right to assume that this implies a lot of reinvestment in productivity? If so, kind of what shape, what form, and where? If you can elaborate on that. And secondly, on business units you're right. The focus for a long time on underperformance has been sort of beauty and grooming. But looking at baby, fem, and family, growth has been quite sluggish for a couple years, pre-tax profit down. And obviously we're fresh off of Kimberly results yesterday. Both of you really seem to be struggling. What does that say about the environment for those businesses, baby, tissue products, et cetera, both in the near term and over the medium to long term? Thank you. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: Jason, I'll take the first one of those. As I said in my prepared remarks, we're expecting to increase operating profit growth from 2% this year to 5% to 6% next year. And in terms of all the pieces and the builds, I'd encourage you to work with John [Chevalier] through the course of the day, and he can help you with that. But against sales growth of 2% to 3%, that obviously implies operating margin progress. And we've been very clear, or tried to be, that the only sustainable model for value creation in this industry is balanced top line and bottom line growth, with margin a part of that. David S. Taylor - Procter & Gamble Co.: And let me give just (1:27:26), one comment about you singled out the paper businesses as particularly challenging. Two of our three paper businesses grew ahead of the category \u2013 ahead of the company. So Family Care grew share, grew nicely, and that's our tissue, towel business. And Fem Care grew ahead of the balance of the company. Baby Care was challenged. And we've been very open about China. We had a very difficult year, growing well below the market. And so that has depressed the Baby Care results. But when we get it right, and the Fem Care, I gave you a couple examples of the super-premium innovation that we have and some of the work frankly we've done on cotton top sheets around the world, we're seeing Fem Care respond nicely. And it's now starting to turn in share growth globally. And Family Care is growing share as well and growing sales and growing profit and a very strong total shareholder return, if I look at that individual business. So and what's interesting about both of those, what's driving them, is innovation well executed in market. Period. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC : Thanks, good morning, guys. David S. Taylor - Procter & Gamble Co.: Morning, Kevin. Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC : David, I wanted to come back to your online strategy. So within the context, there's considerable worry I would say in the market about narrowing of competitive moats, as consumers migrate online where the barriers to entry are lower. You have Amazon, which has expressed an appetite and is investing behind its own private label brands. So and then we've also talked about some worry about commoditization of product categories with some of the trade spending that's going on, et cetera. So as you consider these factors and then naturally the fact that online will become a bigger portion of everyone's channel mix, I have three questions. Opportunities and risks, the larger ones as you see it would be number one. Number two, do you see any further opportunities to expand upon direct-to-consumer capabilities, maybe beyond just outside of blades? And then the third piece, sort of notwithstanding blades, where your market share is naturally going to be lower, given the success of Harry's and Dollar Shave Club. Maybe you could talk a little bit about market share positioning and trends as you see them relative to what we can observe in brick and mortar? Thank you. David S. Taylor - Procter & Gamble Co.: Very good. All good questions, a couple comments. One, just a broad comment about it \u2013 about this space. Because I've got it many, many times saying, the low barrier to entry and the number of brands that come at you presents a big threat to P&G and P&G's great brands. And we've talked often about endless shelf. If anything, online consumers look at less brands than more brands. Walk a store at a big mass merchandiser, and some big categories like hair care you may say, 30, 40, 50 brands. When you go to any one of the online opportunity sources, you'll probably look at page one, maybe page two. And as I mentioned, strong brands often occupy the majority of page one and page two. So actually I think we're well positioned. And brands that are meaningfully better and strong tend to do well. And our online business is actually growing well and growing well in both sales and share. One of the things that I think is going to be critical to win online and it may be even more so, is the level of superiority. Because that then drives you to be getting both the discussion in social media as well as the movement that drives you up the various online companies' algorithms. And then the commoditization comment that you make. I give the same response I did when people talked about it in tissue/towel in 2006 and in any of a number of categories. Commoditization in my mind is \u2013 it occurs when we don't innovate or build brands. In all of the categories we've chosen, there's a real benefit that makes a difference in consumers' lives. If we can provide a differential benefit that's much better than the next best, then I think we're well positioned and maybe even better positioned online, because of the limited selection, because most people do by habit go to page one, page two. Now specifically on some of your questions, one of them that I get asked a lot, should P&G go direct-to-consumer? And the question is, we are testing and have tested and will continue to test a number of models, including a company store, including working on a variety of things from working with our omni retailers and pure plays and everything in between. We've got a direct-with-consumer model, which says we will build a relationship with the consumer. We'll do diagnostics. We've got a good example with Olay Skin Advisor. We'll gather information about our users so that we can serve them well, communicate, and own a relationship that somebody else may fulfill. But certainly our belief so far is that most consumers do not want to have a lot more accounts for narrow parts of their daily or monthly needs. And so an aggregator probably is better positioned to serve the consumer. What we do want to do is have a superior product and a relationship with the consumer so that we can communicate with them appropriately. And we're doing some very interesting and very promising tests in categories like Baby Care and Skin Care with building very strong relationships and a lot of access to names that I think will serve us very well. So it's more the relationship with the consumer. But we will concern and learn. I don't if anybody knows the full answer to this question. But right now I believe that we're best positioned to go through aggregators. And then on market share trends, we're generally doing positive. It's been \u2013 and I'll take the most competitive market in the world in this space, which is China, where our business just passed $1 billion. We grew share online, which is to me a very, very positive sign. And on a few of our categories, our online share is now above our off-line share. Not true in many categories, but in a few that's now happened. So that also bodes well for the future. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: And if you look at it in aggregate, our market shares online are about equal to our market shares off-line. As David rightly said, that differs by category and channel. And importantly, another topic in this space, our margins on aggregate are about equal online and off-line. To the point of the difference in growth rates between the online channels, which are harder for you to see, and the tracked channels. In both the U.S. and China, which are the fastest growing or largest online markets, our growth in both of those countries was 40% in the most recent period. So it is driving a meaningful difference between what you're observing in the tracked channel data and what our all-in sales growth actually is. Operator : And your final question comes from the line of Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes, hi. Good morning. So I just wanted to expand a little bit more on your comment regarding digital marketing. It feels like you're rethinking what marketing really means and how to communicate with consumers, especially with the new generation of millennial consumers. So could you \u2013 like is that right? And it feels like overall the way we think about marketing as advertising is potentially going to be down this year? So could you confirm that? And just elaborate a little bit more about how you think \u2013 what is the best way to communicate with consumers? Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: Yeah. David S. Taylor - Procter & Gamble Co.: A couple comments. Certainly we are and have been rethinking marketing in that it will evolve. But I think the key is building the relationship with the consumer and communicating the full range of benefits of your brand in a way that makes a difference to the consumer. How we do that has changed. What we're trying to do I don't think has changed a lot. We now use a variety of different channels. And certainly social medial has exploded in its importance. There will be those that talk about not only the zero, first, and second moment of truth, but even after the in-home usage experience, now there's another moment you have to worry about, which is what consumers say about you in social media on Instagram or Facebook or any variety of different vehicles. And I think that's true, which is all the more reason why you both have to have a superior product, but also communicate it in a way. And the brand has to stand for something. It's one of the reasons why I believe campaigns like the Like a Girl, some of you may have seen the Ariel, Share the Load we ran in India. Or the SK-II Marriage Market campaign have really resonated with consumers, because they've gone beyond just communicating that the brand is superior, but the brand has a point of view. And it's one that sparks conversations about things that matter. And so that's beyond what I'd say traditional marketing of communicating the benefit of your brand. It's having an equity and equity that matters. And each of our brands is thinking through what that looks like. And then finding the smart and appropriate way to communicate that to the consumer, when and where they're receptive to the message, so that it's less of an intrusion. It's more giving them things that help them understand the brand and make informed choices. And that part I think is working well. The brands that do it best are the ones that are growing. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: We need to stop here. We need to get on with delivering another above objective year. I know we didn't get to everybody. I apologize for that. I also know it's a busy day for you. And I want to thank you for the time with us this morning. I'll just turn it over to David for some quick closing remarks. And then John and I are available in the balance of the day. David S. Taylor - Procter & Gamble Co.: Yes, one, I want to thank everybody for participating today and let you know that we do see opportunities going forward. We had a year where we made progress. We're on plan, and the plan is working. It's innovation driven growth. It's fueled by productivity across all spend pools and all areas of the business. And it is enabled and sustained by an organization today that is more agile, more focused, and accountable. Today we have the plan, we have the portfolio, and we have the people to win. And we are extraordinarily focused to make that happen over the next year, three years, five years, and beyond. Thank you all for participating today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

P&G would like to remind you that today's discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections. Also as required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on the underlying growth trends of the business and has posted on its Investor Relations website, www.pginvestor.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP and other financial measures. Now I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller. Jon Moeller : Thanks for coming this morning, actually this evening our time from P&G's officers in Guangzhou, China. China as you know is P&G's second largest market both in terms of sales and profit. Given as importance I am in the market two or three times each year and this time we just thought we take advantage of the resources here to give you deeper perspective and its important business and the progress we are making. China and Guangzhou are special places for me. My wife Lisa and I lived and worked here in the 90s. We hired and developed mush of the finance talent that helps lead P&G's China business today. It's always very good to be back. I am joined here this morning by Sumeet Vohra, the End-to-End Category General Manager for China Hair Care. I am also joined by Matthew Price, President of China Selling and Market Operations. Matthew reports today the Taylor, our CEO. And we are joined by Jasmine Xu, who works with the end-to-end categories in China on building on omnichannel ecommerce capability. With double eleven right around the corner here in China, I am sure Jasmine will have some interesting perspective to share. Let me turn first though to the company's results for the July-September quarter. As we said on our last earnings call, this quarter presented our most difficult top line comparison of the year. Underlying market growth was notably stronger in the base period than it is now. As you have no doubt heard from others, market growth continues to be sluggish. We estimate global category below 2.5% for the quarter, a modest deceleration versus the April-June period. P&G organic sales grew 1% on 1% volume growth fully in line with our internal estimates going into the quarter. These results include about a 30 basis point impacts from the earthquake in Mexico and hurricanes in Texas to Gulf Coast and Puerto Rico each of which causes the halt operations in these geographies during the quarter. They also include a 40 basis point impact from the combination of U.S. pricing investments and discontinued brands of product forms. All of these impacts will dissipate as the year progresses. Market share trends continue to improve with 13 of the top 20 countries and 14 of the top 20 brands, 65% of top 20 counties, 70% of top 20 brands growing or holding share. Ecommerce growth continues to be very strong, up 40% with seven out of ten categories growing share and two others holding share. 90% of categories growing or holding ecommerce share. On the bottom line, all earnings per share were $1.06, up 10% versus the prior year. Core earnings per share were $1.09, up 6%. This includes the $0.03 headwind from higher commodity costs and a penny from the natural disasters I mentioned earlier. These impacts, negative mix and increase investments more than offset triple digit productivity savings contributing to a modest core operating profit decline of 40 basis points versus year ago. The core effective tax rate was 23.4% about a half point above last year. Free cash flow productivity was 87%, we repurchased $1.5 billion in shares and distributed $1.8 billion in dividends this quarter and totaled $4.3 billion of value return to shareholders. Net results that were in line with our going and expectations, despite some unanticipated negative impacts and slowing market growth continued going to increase the number of brands of markets that are holding and growing share both offline and online continuing to deliver productivity savings with strong cash flow. As a result, we are maintaining fiscal year guidance across all elements top line, bottom line and cash. We expect organic sales growth of 2% to 3%, despite the continued deceleration of market growth rates. This estimate includes about a quarter of a point of headwind from portfolio cleanup in the ongoing business. It also includes the headwind from the price adjustment on the U.S. blades and razors business made late last fiscal year. Again both of these headwinds with have their biggest impact in the first half of the year and will annualize as the year progresses. We expect fiscal 2018 all in sales growth of around 3%. This includes a zero to half point net benefit from the combination of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestitures and the impact of the India goods and services tax implementation. Our bottom line guidance as for core earnings per share growth of 5% to 7%. We expect core operating profit growth to be the primary driver of core earnings per share growth this fiscal year. We expect to combine the impact of interest expense, interest income and other non-operating income to the net headwind on fiscal 2018 core earnings per share growth. The core effective tax rates should be around 24%, roughly in line with fiscal 2017. Share count will be an EPS benefit of about 2 percentage points due to discreet share repurchase and the carryover benefit from the beauty transaction share exchange that benefited July-September results but is now fully in the base period comparisons going forward. We planned to deliver another year of 90% or better free cash flow productivity. This includes CapEx in the range of 5% to 5.5% of sales. We'll continue our strong track record of cash return to shareholders. We expect to pay nearly $7.5 billion in dividends and repurchased $4 billion to $7 billion of our shares in fiscal 2018. At current rates and prices, FX has held of about $150 million after tax versus a year ago. Following the natural disasters we're now estimating about a $300 million profit hit from higher commodity costs. We knew we'd see higher pulp cost going into year, these costs have continue to increase beyond initial forecast ranges. Ethylene, propylene, kerosene, and the polyethylene and polypropylene resins have increased recently primarily as a result of the hurricanes in the Gulf. Significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar further commodity cost increases our addition geopolitical are not anticipated within this guidance range. Turning now to China. We're making significant progress in this very important market. In fiscal 2016, two years ago, organic sales declined 5%. Last fiscal year, we grew 1%. We're projecting mid-single-digit growth this year. And the quarter we just completed, China organic sales grew 8%. Including about 2 points of pre-shipments for Double 11 day. So far, October is trending fully in line with expectations, so we have a very good start toward our mid-single-digit objective for the fiscal year. Two year ago, again in fiscal 2016, two of seven product categories grew organic sales in China. Last fiscal year, we grew sales in five of seven categories, this quarter we grew in six of seven and we expect organic sales growth in all seven categories over the course of the fiscal year. Of the ten sub-categories in which we compete in China, 4 grew share offline and 7 grew share online over the last three month period, up from 2 and 5 respectively over the last 12 months. A few highlights, SK-II organic sales grew more than 40% this quarter, driven by the successful digital campaign, hashtag I never expire and the additional new users in department stores and online. Olay organic sales were up mid-teens driven by the launch of the premium Olay self-science boutique in September and strong growth or ecommerce and counter businesses. Hair Care has made sequential market share progress over the past few quarters, driven by new premium, innovation on Head & Shoulders, Pantene and Rejoice. Sumeet will share more detail on these innovations in just a few minutes. Family Care organic sales grew mid-teens, driven by continued growth of premium innovations like Whisper Infinity and Radiant our best preforming thin pads. Whisper Pink, our mid-tier cotton like top sheets innovation and the launch of Whisper pure cotton our new premium pad with a 100% natural cotton top sheet. Oral Care grew 7%. Pampers launched its new premium tier taped diaper, Pampers ichiban in August along with the re-launch of the premium pant style diaper. Both are produced in Japan and imported into China. Pampers ichiban is already available in more than 10,000 baby stores and nearly 4,800 hyper and super stores. Consumer awareness continues to build, consumer comments and product radians are very good and consumer conversion from competitive premium tiers is strong. In August, Pampers grew share in the premium segment for the first time in many years. We're also making significant progress in the overall pant segment. This is the fastest growing form in the market growing at a 40% clip. Pampers is now the market leader in the platform in China, up from number 5 just two years ago. Pampers pant sales in July-September grew 200% versus the prior year. China Pampers overall sales and share for the quarter were much improved versus prior quarters, but we're still below year-ago levels in total due to soft shipments and mid-tier tape diapers which account for about 75% of base period shipments as wholesale inventories were drawn down ahead of new innovation and pack size shipments and as we work through and innovation related price increase. We expect to grow China Baby Care sales this fiscal year and return Pampers to share growth which would mark a significant turnaround. We continue to build share in ecommerce in China. We grew ecommerce sales approximately 60% this quarter and a market growing around 50% with 7 out of 10 categories and sub-categories holding our growing online market share. Accelerating growth in China is important to both the top and bottom lines of our company. After tax profit margins in China remain very strong, despite significant investments over the last few years and product and package innovations, additional sales resources and targeted value corrections. So second largest profit contributor after the U.S. with one of our highest after tax margin, so growth here matters. I know want to turn to Matthew, Sumeet and Jasmine to give you a deeper view into the progress we're making in China. Sumeet, our largest China businesses Hair Care which you run, can you start by just giving us an overview of the Hair Care market in China and P&G's position in it. Sumeet Vohra : Thank you, Jon. I am going to focus my remarks on the mainland China. China is the biggest Hair Care market in the world with retail sales of $8 billion. P&G is the market leader in China by a distance. We're nearly three times as big as the number two player and four of the top five hair care brands are from P&G. The Hair Care market is growing mid-single-digits. P&G's portfolio of brands, strong brand equities, our technologies, favorable cost structure and innovation program puts us in a strong position to create value in China Hair Care. Jon Moeller : You know Sumeet have been - to me a couple of important organization changes in Hair Care in China. One of course is going end-to-end. Another is having sufficient resources on the ground in China. And the third is probably the priority the global category has placed on the China Hair Care business. Do you agree with that observation and how do you see those changes making a difference? Sumeet Vohra : Yeah, I agree with that observation. These organization changes and the priority from the global category have made a big difference to our business. Category dedication is helping Hair Care expertise in our sales teams and partner more effectively with our retail partners. With sufficient resources in China, decisions are being made closer to the ground and hence the quality of decisions and speed has improved. One example of speed, we finalize the packaging design for Rejoice Micro-Silicone water in mid-December and we shift in May that is within 18 weeks. These intervention are helping us deliver sequential improvement in Hair Care sales and market share. Jon Moeller : So tell us about innovation in Hair Care and why it matters? Sumeet Vohra : Innovation in Hair Care is key to delighting consumers, keeping our brands relevant and growing the category. As you know, our recent premium price innovation such as Rejoice Water, Pantene Three Minute Miracle, Pantene Hair Energy Water and Head & Shoulders Supreme are great examples of this. These are very good products and consumers and customers are happy with them. We are also innovating and marketing in media. Our recent break the rules program on Vera Sweeney [ph] has helped us grow very nicely. Our innovation program together with the go-to-market interventions has helped grow China Hair Care business 2% in fiscal 2017 and 5% the quarter just concluded. Our market share trends are improving and we grew offline retail share in the last reported period. Jon Moeller : And very importantly, how do you feel about the future of Hair Care in China? Sumeet Vohra : We have a strong portfolio brands that take us to the most important needs in the category. We are bringing it in the simple products, packages and innovations to the market. We have now gone end-to-end and have sufficient resources on the ground were empower to make decisions. We have significantly increased speak to market and are now working to bring innovations from idea to market in less than six months. And we have attractive market structure. These intervention set us up as a thought leader in the industry and in a very strong position in China Hair Care. Jon Moeller : And Matthew, where do you think we are in the overall China turnaround, what are the opportunities and challenges that lay ahead of us? Matthew Price : Thank you, Jon. To execute the turnaround, we needed to bring more premium innovation and better cover the growing channels. All of the categories have built premium innovation in the last six months. Also we are strengthening our coverage of key channels including dedicated coverage of baby and cosmetic stores. Hence I am pleased report, we grew sales 8% this quarter which puts us on track to deliver mid-single digit for the fiscal year. This is in line with market growth. You asked me about key challenges. I think one is to deal with what we call here moving China speed. We believe with the end-to-end organization decision making with a GBUs having more decision making on the ground and they are scaled organization will increasingly well set up to achieve this. Jon Moeller : And as President of the Selling and Market Operations Organization here in China, what are your priorities? Matthew Price : My policy is to amplify the innovation and brand plans that the GBUs developed and enable them to benefit from our scale. I'd like to give you some examples. Innovation, as you know China has very distinct channels such as ecommerce, cosmetics stores, hyper stores, baby stores and multiple small store formats. The SMO make sure that the plan are tailored by channel and can be executed with excellence. Media is one of the largest advertisers in China, therefore it makes perfect sense to use our corporate scale to create winning partnerships with all media companies. Sumeet has plans that have mass market TV bias and other brands that require much more targeting and are more digital. The SMO ensures he gets the best deal but the performance can be measured and we provide a menu of media options. Customer Support. At buyer level, as we've already discussed, we have category focused through the end-to-end dealing with the buy direct. But customers and us want joint business plans and strategic partnerships at corporate level that build value for both sides. The SMO leads us. Distributor management, a very large part of our business goes through distributors to small stores. Our scale enables us to have industry leading distribution. We ensure our programs of appropriate and sequence to enable each brand to maximize in-store presence and trial. It also enables us to have industry beating receivables. Logistics, China is big, we have over 1,000 ship to locations. To deliver industry leading logistics costs and customer service, we deliver on a multi category basis which is what our customers want. Our logistics operation is a cost to be used scale play again run by the SMO. Government Relations, it's critical in China maintaining and building national and provincial government relations to ensure strong support the GBUs to pursue their business. Organization, building a winning organization to the GBUs and SMO have a strong talent supply, again led by the SMO. Lastly, digital. We're building corporate digital capabilities that are critical for the GBUs to develop consumer, shopper and business insides. So the data is managed by the SMO, because this is clearly a scale play. These are just some examples of how the SMO and GBU end-to-end model work. So we're pleased to see the results coming through with 8% growth this quarter. Jon Moeller : And just picking up on your comment on digital, maybe you can give us a few examples? Matthew Price : So we are developing suppliers who gather install data digitally to provide insight for ourselves, people and track our progress but also having digitized media tracking so we can measure reach across platforms and multiple devices. We work with key digital player such as Tencent, Bitauto Weibo , Alibaba, Jingdong and the omnichannels. We are building big data analytics that enabled targeted and measurable marketing. We are using digital tools to increase insurance and complaints. All of this leads to better consumer insights but shopper insights and better business understanding to the business units. Jon Moeller : And Jasmine maybe you can share with us what your role is how it's supports the category organizations? Jasmine Xu : Thank you, John. I lead the Chinese e-com company business which is the fastest growing channel with more than $1 billion itself. Our team has two missions, grow online penetration for each category. We have marketing and sales team dedicated for each category who report to the regional business units. At the same time, we create skilled capability as competitive advantage such as big data, ecommerce supply chain and media targeting capability. These scale capabilities actually enable each of the category to grow their brands. Jon Moeller : And what are the biggest challenges and opportunities you see in ecommerce and how are we addressing them? Jasmine Xu : I will summarize e-com challenges in two ways, one is speed of change, innovations and changes happen at a faster pace online. The second one is really trading up, 45% of the China e-com market in our relevant categories are already in premium tiers. This challenges actually are equally opportunity for P&G. We've focused on a few things. Operating our marketing model to be more digitally driven and socially focused. We walk with e-com player to leverage big data to reach the relevant shopper where they are ready to buy. We also fully leverage the drop of order to win. More than half of our online business is premium tiers and new forms. Our fastest growing brands, our premium brands such as SK-II, power toothbrushes with infinity. We build a strong team. The local e-com team have deep insights and with the end-to-end structure that enables faster decision making. Our skilled capability creates a match competitive advantage. Co-instance we have medium problematic media capability, I know company do a lot of e-market app to make sure that we stay ahead. Jon Moeller : Sure, everybody wants to know how are we doing with millennial consumers online? Jasmine Xu : First of all Jon, our team is full of passionate Chinese Millennials and in fact 80% of my team is Millennials. From shopper standpoint, the average profile of P&G online shopper is 28 year old female, living in one of the top cities in China. Over the last two years, our online shopper profile has got younger. To delight Millennials, we're doing more authentic storytelling instead of traditional advertising. We understand Millennials prefer a more personalized experience. For examples consumers combine all of the power brush which come with their names and horoscope printed on the handle. We launch technology innovations such as virtual reality and automotive reality to invite consumer to interact with their favorite brand ambassadors. Jon Moeller : Very importantly, are we prepared for Double 11 day? Jasmine Xu : Yeah, we very much look forward to another successful Double 11. We were leverage dispute window to create trial on our latest and best innovations. We work with customers to accelerate kind of a growth. Our logistic network supply chain and online consultant teams are fully ready to buy provide consumers a delightful Double 11 experience and I'm also ready to buy a lot by myself. Jon Moeller : Thank you each for your perspective. What I've experienced in the last three days working with you in China has a ton of energy, a passionate organization that is moving much more quickly and effectively to delight an increasingly premium and increasingly digital consumer at his or her speed enabled by an end-to-end category structure, working with an SMO that's building world class platforms and capabilities. I felt in the last week the same palpable excitement I felt back in 1996 when we were just embarking on this journey and my expectations are accordingly high. Hopefully, this brief discussion has been insightful for investors. I'm going to wrap up and then we'll head to Q&A. Our results of the first quarter were in line with our expectations and keep us fully on track for the fiscal year. We continue to make progress, growing market share and more businesses and narrowing share gaps and many others. We're showing strong progress in China which as I've said is a very important market for P&G. There are sure to be speed bumps and even a few hairpin turns ahead but our new operating approach end-to-end and freedom within a framework will enable us to be more agile as we navigate through these challenges. Productivity gains will provide fuel for investment and the ability to offset negative surprises just as we saw in the last quarter and grow margin as the year progresses. Before we begin the Q&A portion of the call, I'd like to remind you that the purpose of today's call is to provide perspective on the business. At this point, we have no further comments regarding the pending certification of the proxy contest results. And with that, we are happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Rae Lieberman : Great. Thanks. And I actually wanted to talk a little bit about Gillette in total and the grooming business as a bit weaker than we would expected, so I was hoping we could kind of dig in on two fronts, one is just what you are seeing in the U.S. market in terms of the result and responsiveness of the market. The price may had been a kind of impacting overall portfolio performance? And then results on guessing an immerging markets maybe a little bit better because there is just priced how negative mix level that you know that was geographical product? Thanks. Jon Moeller : Great. In terms of the U.S. innovation, it's generally working. As I think you know the first part of that is brought to market is pricing with product and communication to follow across the price tiers. In the - though the last six months, we have the highest volume shipment we've had in 11 years. And if we look at the most recent share period, past one month share was up 1.4 points in terms of volume which is the first share growth in two and half years. So again it's early, this is the business with a long purchase cycle and we're still bringing the balance of the program to market but generally that is operating as we expected it would. The pricing reduction as you know is averaged about 12%, so the impact on total segment organic sales is not insignificant. There was another big impact in the quarter and grooming which was the margin of Brazil. And there, there is we are going through a pricing cycle and we're experiencing the inventory dynamics that typically come with that cycle. If you take out North American and Brazil, you get the positive growth on the balance of the segment globally. And I apologize Lauren, I think you asked another part of the question but maybe someone else remind me, I forgot that, but that's essentially how the growing business are shacking up. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : Hey, good morning or good night I guess. So if I look at the divisional profit results ex-corporate expense, you were down 3.5% year-over-year in the quarter, get results can bounce around quarter-to-quarter but it's also down 3% on average in the last three quarters despite ad spend being down in that timeframe. So you know we've been hearing from you guys that the turnaround is progressing, why are we seeing more underlying profit progress and is the more difficult external environment in terms of slower category growth and an increase cost of doing business, is that more than offsetting any internal improvements and that change going forward? Jon Moeller : So we're still expecting that the majority of EPS growth for the year is driven by operating and earnings growth as I said in the prepared remarks. And we are right, where we expected to be in terms of that progression. The quarter was a little bit more challenging, as I also indicated in the prepared remarks than we would have expected going in with the run up of commodity cost and the impact of the natural disasters. Things like very expensive fright laying and shipping laying in many of the impacted geographies. Also as you know the productivity savings will build as we grow through the fiscal year and will also began annualizing the significant investment associated with the pricing reductions in July. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : Thanks. Hello guys. Thanks for the questions. So John question on industry growth that you are speaking to the 2.5% or actually sub 2.5% excuse me, I am just trying to reconcile that with some of the positive immerging markets commentary that were hearing from other CPG companies and you guys of course stand very good on China today and still are looking for mid-single growth. So can we get an update on where you are seeing slowing, presumably this is U.S. and other developed markets but maybe just comment specifically on what you are seeing from a growth rate in those regions and how that's potential change would be the first question. And then number two, is there any large change in view with respect to where you think you come in on the 2% to 3% core sales for the year? Thank you for those. Jon Moeller : Sure, Kevin. So in the quarter, if we just split developed and developing markets from a market standpoint, growth was about half a point in developed market and about 5 points in developing markets. So if you look at that sequentially, it's really an aggregate continued mid-singles digit level of growth in developing where the slowdown has been undeveloped and that is primarily the U.S. And in terms of how that shapes our view the range of 2% to 3%, we as you know we're maintaining that range, I mean obviously the rate of market growth through the balance of the year will have an impact on where we end up within that range, but we're shooting as much as we can get. Operator : And next we'll go to Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Bonnie Herzog : Thank you. Hi Jon. Curious to hear how you view the current promotional environment in the U.S. right now? And then in looking at your activity, it does still appear to be pretty high versus historical levels but maybe that settled off on a year-over-year basis recently. So I guess on looking back, do you think the greater promotion you make over the last couple of years has really been successful or do you think it ultimately you know just resulted in taking dollars out of the categories? And then as you think about your share figures you know which have stated to stabilize a bit after I guess what appears to be slight pull back on promos, do you think be more rationale has contributed to some slight share improvement in the last few months? Jon Moeller : We probably see this slightly differently, let me just step back, I kind of walk you through how I see it. As you know, we'd rather spend a dollar on innovation or equity every day the week before we spend money on promotion. We need to be competitive on promotion, but it's not our desired, not high on our list of priorities in terms of spend. And the reason is very simple is because there is nothing proprietary and promotion whereas we can build proprietary advantage with those innovation and equity investments. If you look at the quarter, price including - inclusive of promotion had no impact to top line growth, it was neutral. And if you over the - pricing has been neutral to positive for 28 consecutive quarters for 13 consecutive years again backing up my statement that's not typically the first card that we like to play. If I look at the U.S. P&G percentage of dollars sold on promotion was essentially flat, it was 101 index versus a year ago. It's obviously difference by category but again not indicative of a strategy that involves heavy promotion increases. What is happening and what's very confusing is that retailers particularly in the U.S. are choosing to make investments in price as they compete with each other. And that shows up in the scanner data as a promotion but it's not one that's been funded by the manufacture and that case has been funded by the retailer. And with generally category leading brands and the strategy being to drive shoppers into store on the part of the retailer, our brands often disproportionately benefit in quotes from those kinds of investments. So long winded but generally I don't see a significant changes in promotion, going forward, we would rather spend money on innovation and equity building, but we do need to be and will be competitive in the promotion arena. I hope that helps and happy to talk more about it later. Operator : And your next question comes from line of Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : Hi, good evening there. Good morning, everyone else. Could you elaborate on the bridge offset the commodities cost increase and particularly pulp and resin? And is it like you are expecting the product mix to get better because of the lap of the last or you are re-launching China? And also if I understood correctly, you mentioned that the new diaper conversion in China has been strong but can you please expand on the diaper re-launch in China and how is the initial performance has been? Jon Moeller : Yeah, so we're generally answering one question here, so I am going to talk what I think is probably the most one which is diapers and turn that over to Matthew Price and ask him to provide some perspective. Matthew Price : Okay. So we launched in August. We are going to share in the premium tier which we launched ichiban. And as Jon also mentioned, we grew pants share as well from being number five two years ago. So we - as I have to with the progress, we're also seeing that the ratings and reviews are relying with competition, we believe it is on track. Jon Moeller : And from a commodity standpoint, I mentioned the increases versus are going to forecasts are primarily due to increases on Petra complex coming out of the Gulf as a result of the hurricanes. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark Astrachan : Yeah, thanks and good afternoon, guys and good evening. My suggest SK-II is kind of for the large majority of growth in China in the quarter, I guess is that a fair characterization and then broadly looking at SK-II contribution overall Beauty segment sales assuming it was a contributing factor to the 4% mix growth. What does it imply about sort of the rest of the Beauty business in particular I think considering you lost share across most categories last year. So you what you have to do is starting seeing material improvement across the whole portfolio going forward? I guess how do you think about it and where is it going to start, where do you find the most difficulty so forth and so on? Thank you. Jon Moeller : Look, as we look at China, I wouldn't necessarily agree with the statement that SK-II drove all the growth that certainly was very growth fall at 40%. But as I mentioned earlier, Olay grew in the mid-teens, Feminine Care business grew in the mid-teens, Oral Care grew 7%, Hair Care as Sumeet mentioned grew 5%. So the breath of growth in China extends well beyond SK-II. As I mentioned six or seven categories grew sales in the quarter and we expect that to be seven of seven over the course of the fiscal year. Beauty in general is doing very well. SK-II is part of that success but it's much broader than that. Beauty on a global basis delivered its eighth consecutive quarter of organic sales growth. We're seeing good growth in the Hair Care portion of the business as well as in the Skin and Personal Care side of the business that's actually a bright point for us at the moment. Operator : And next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj : Hi, guys. So over the past few weeks, you guys have been crisscrossing payment that globe meeting with investor sometimes with board members sometimes without. Given those discussions and there are plenty of them which is good and the kind of 0.3% lead you have so far and the proxy though. Can you give us a sense of some of key messages the management team and the board have taken away from all that, what were messages you actually heard from your institutional investors? Jon Moeller : I will be happy to comment on the messages that I've heard. I obviously won't speak for others who aren't in the room. It's been a great opportunity to engage with investors both at the management level and the board level as you indicated. Clearly, what's been driven home to me is the passion that our investors have both large and small and that's a great asset and their interest in the company. And their ideas relative to, its success are also an incredible asset. I received very strong support for the plan that we've embarked on with the clear desire to see it sooner. So clear the message to me is be even more deliberate, more quick and making the changes that we've been talking about. And certainly as I've been here in China this week, I see the team doing the same. And I would say the third thing is a desire that is broadly expressed to increase the connection between the investor base, the management team and the board and make sure that we are fully benefiting from perspective that they have. So those are my three takeaways. Again I think that it's been a very useful and beneficial experience. Operator : The next question comes from line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Hey, guys. Thank you for squeeze me and I really appreciate it. Congratulations on some of the momentum in China, it's very encouraging to hear. I wanted to come back to your comments on the U.S. both in terms of deceleration, I was particularly intrigued by your comments of some degree of U.S. retail price of subsidization. So first, can you give us sort of your thoughts on what you think has driven the deceleration in the U.S.? Why do you think it's proved to be so persistent throughout the year? Any sort of indication you have of what's driving the underlying softness there? And then secondly, the comment that retailers may be subsidizing some of the prices, is a little bit concerning because they don't seem to have a whole lot of margin flex to sustain that. How does this sustained, you are hearing comments from various other competitors talking about eroding price environment? Why shouldn't we think that this either translates down the road to a removal of subsidization therefore a volume impact you or a need for you to help fund some of that? Jon Moeller : Thanks, Jason. In terms of let me just start with the market growth. And the simple answer isn't very fulfilling which is that I really - we've been unable to put our finger on why this has been. If we look at consumption for instance from our household panel data, there really is no change in consumption level across categories with one exception which is grooming which is driven by the style preference. If we look at trade up or trade down within the market which also could have an impact on the dollar growth rate, we also see very little chance. Over the last three years, private label as one measure of this shares are essentially flat in the U.S., they are also essentially flat in Europe. There's been some uptick in the last quarter call it 30 basis points of share. It's concentrated in two categories though, it's not broad based; those two categories are tissue towel and grooming. In tissue towel, we're building share so that isn't impact in our business. We are familiar with the some of the private label launches in the grooming segment, but there's nothing there that really explains the broad category slowdown. I've heard theories none of which I can really get comfortable with that attempt to explain the slowdown, one is that post the election the Hispanic consumer has withdrawn more from the market and is concerned about, is both concerned about their future and sending more money home and as a result is spending less. But as we look across the data that we can see across cities and geography is that have higher percent of Hispanic consumers there isn't a difference in market growth in those areas versus others. The other theory that's been positive is that consumers are spending an increasing portion of their wallet on services. Healthcare, entertainment, data and mobile phone and therefore are spending less on stables, which doesn't make sense to me either because I mean I don't get it. I want a cell phones so I am not going to wash my hair, it doesn't make a lot of sense to me. So unfortunately, as I said my answer would be somewhat frustrating there, we're still searching. In terms of the retail dynamic, it's not across all categories, it's in a few categories, there is probably most pronounced in the baby care category because of the value of that shopper, the perceived value of that shopper to either Amazon, Wal-Mart, Target, Costco you name it. And what we're trying to do to prevent the outcome that you describe is to help retailers with differentiated offerings for their shoppers, so that there's less direct comparison in that therefore less need to compete on that basis. But this is obviously something that is a challenge and does affect the market numbers as I said earlier. But we're making good progress and avoiding the negative impacts of that as I mentioned price continues to be neutral as a contributor to top line. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge Research. Jonathan Feeney : Good morning, thanks very much. I really enjoyed the presentation on China and I should say good evening. Good morning for everyone else. I wanted to ask you about from the presentation first, how does your premium share of focusing in China on ecommerce compare with offline? Is that made is that different presumably higher because more because of ecommerce capabilities you have or more because of the kind of people who are shopping online, if there is just something to more premium shopper likely to do that. And what learnings are there in planning which why can't that model be exported readily to North America in other developed markets where presumably there's a lot of premium shopping going on and a ton of opportunity to grab that high-end consumer where not just Procter but other CPG companies are just getting a lot smaller share of the pie over the past decade? Thank you. Jon Moeller : Maybe I will ask Jasmine to comment on that across categories within China and then ask some Sumeet to comment on that from what he sees from his Hair Care perspectives. Jasmine? Jasmine Xu : Sure, for Chinese e-com business we actually have more than 60% of the business in a premium tiers and new forms is driven by few factors, the first one is we certainly amplify already pretty innovations brought by the categories and to support our innovations, we also try to adopt a new business model which is much more digital focused. And also leverage the social comment to what amount to make sure that would drive authentic storytelling among the premium users. We also use big data to make sure that we understand the shopper inside out and target them at the time that where when they are willing to buy our products. So end-to-end from product innovation or the way about how we drive marketing as social with excellent online was what one of the key drivers why our premium business portion is much bigger online compared to other places maybe. Sumeet Vohra : And from Hair Care line what I'm seeing is that the consumer is really attracted to a lot of the premium proposition in Hair Care and they're also buying the bucket size is bigger than they tend to buy more items like shampoos, conditioners and treatments. And what we're saying is that they're also really responsive to the innovation that we are bringing. So combination of the hunger for the consumer to shop for multiple items and the innovation that we're bringing is really helping us build business e-com space in China. Jonathan Feeney : And what do you see in terms of difference between e-com and offline in terms of the percentage of businesses premium? Sumeet Vohra : So in terms of the percentage of business that is premium e-com tends to be significantly higher. So in fact some of the new premium brands that we have launched or the proposition that we've launched, they tend to sell a lot more on e-com and consumers tend to drive them a lot faster than we see in offline. Jon Moeller : And relative to the question on, is there reapplication potential here, I think definitely the answer is yes. There's a lot of what I've seen here and previously what Matthew was talking about earlier some of the digital capability has clear, replication potential, our experiences with marketing and moving more to a pole versus a push model is certainly has reallocation. There's a lot of exciting learning here that we will be replying globally. Jonathan Feeney : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes in line of Caroline Levy with Macquarie. Caroline Levy : Hi, there, thank you so much. I love to just dig a little deeper into the China situation because I know a lot is riding on the Japanese input. But I think you said 75% of your business is still in non-premium well not the super-premium diaper. Couple of things, can you just explain a little bit what the strategy is to grow the other part of the business? Can you talk about whether there has been in any comparative response and just any detail on the growth and your strategy going forward? I was hoping to see or hear a little more detail on the successful of the launch but it sounds to me like you really don't know yet? Jon Moeller : A couple of things there, one, I mean we just launched in August, so relative to July, August and September results was a very short period of time that product was actually end-market. And as I indicated earlier, it's the first time we've built share in the premium tier for a long period of time, so while it's still very early, it certainly is working. Matthew mentioned the ratings and reviews which are our parity with top competitors which is also encouraging and very important in a China context. And the mainline diaper or the mid-tier which is you rightly said was 75% of the year ago business. That I mention in the prepared remarks, the decline there is largely an inventory related dynamic going all the way through the wholesale channels related to the timing of innovation and price. And I think Matthew we saw relatively flat consumption across last part of the business during the quarter, is that right? Matthew Price : We've seen actually our total assumption up pick picked up a little bit and we just thought our latest hyper share which shares to the first time in building total shares. So very early days but looks like the assumption is picking up and we believe from all the consumer ratings and reviews that we have a win on our hand, we also are betting big on pants where we have made great progress from number five as number one that we really drive the big growth in time both on high and mid-tier. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello with Raymond James. Joe Altobello : Thank you. Good evening, guys. Both my questions been answered here I guess but I did want to shift back to ecommerce for a second, I think it's about 5% your sales and growing 40%, so the math there is pretty straightforward. And I think you've also said that your offline and online shares are pretty similar, but the first which of your businesses be over index and under index in terms of online versus offline shares? And then secondly what is the impact on margins given how quickly this channel shift is happening? Thanks. Jon Moeller : So online versus offline share or is this different by category by market, so within the same category can be very different by market, within the same market it can be very different by category. So I don't have a universal answer for you there. It's also impacted pretty dramatically by the structure of the market in terms of for example whether people have, whether people are using public transportation or private transportation, whether they can handle bulky products or not, they has to do with the relevance of categories in different markets, but maybe that to shine some light on this, let's just talk China, I think Jasmine probably the e-com market index is more to skin care than any other categories, is that right? Jasmine Xu : Yeah actually e-com is very much good to skin care, the beauty care as well the high-end of the personal care including razors, power brush as a premium care brands et cetera. So it is a very much beauty and high-end product. Jon Moeller : Whereas for example going back to my comments, if you look at the U.S. market it tends to be over developed and products that are bulky, so diapers, paper towels, liquid detergent are tend to be overdeveloped, but it's very different by market. And our strategy is to be fully relevant in any channel that a consumer wants to shop and therefore be well positioned to when regardless of the habits within an individual market. Operator : And our final question comes from the line of Jon Andersen with William Blair. Jon Andersen : Good evening, everybody. Jon, you mentioned earlier that one of the feedback points from investors that you've met with recently is the desire for you perhaps some faster progression along certain elements of the change program, support for the change program but looking to accelerate some things. Could you share your perspective on perhaps which elements of the change program and I know there are many of them from portfolio to word structure to cost efficiencies, but which element of the change program in your perspective are most conducive or likely to be accelerated as you look forward over the next 12 to 24 months? Thank you. Jon Moeller : That's a very good question. As you know in our first productivity program, we were able to exceed and accelerate the cost savings significantly versus our going in assumption. That's going to be less easy to do this time because more the savings are coming from very capital intensive redesign of our supply chain. But still there's work we're working to do there, we had a leadership team discussion on that just this week on how we can accelerate some of the productivity savings and we'll work to do that, will update you as we have more perspective. Also I think there's a strong desire on the part of both the management team and the organization itself to continue advancing some of the changes that we've made in the organization structure and beginning to think as we actively all hear talk this week about if you will version 2.0 and what are the next steps in that in that journey. So I think there's a lot we can do when Sumeet was talking about accelerating the pace to market with innovation as a result of the new organization structure, I think that's something we also have a massive opportunity to be more deliberate about faster time to market, but also faster globalization of great ideas and smart ideas which has historically taken us some time. So we're going - and look there's nobody who wants this, nobody wants the results faster and better than us and I know the team here, so we'll be working hard on that. Jon Moeller : Listen thank you everybody. I hope our experiment here was useful to you. If you have any feedback I'd love to get it both positive and negative. And I know I speak for the China team what I say that we really appreciate the opportunity to engage with you. So thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

P&G would like to remind you that today's discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections. Also, as required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on the underlying growth trends of the business and has posted on its Investor Relations website, www.pginvestor.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP and other financial measures. Now, I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller. Jon Moeller : Good morning. I'm going to start with a brief review of the company's results for the October/December quarter and discuss progress against our key strategic focus areas. I'll update our outlook for the fiscal year, including the impact of the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and then we will open the call for your questions. Results for the quarter were in line with our going-in expectations, and as a result, we remain on track to achieve our fiscal year objectives. Organic sales grew more than 2%, an acceleration of more than a point from last quarter. Sales increase versus year ago in 14 of our 15 largest markets and in 8 out of 10 categories. This growth occurred against some significant headwinds. The U.S. still had pricing interventions reduced organic sales growth rate by about 30 basis points. There was also a 40 basis point impact from the combination of retail inventory reductions in the United States, and the impact from the Government of Algeria banning finished product imports into its markets, in total, about a 70 basis point headwind in the delivery of over 2%. Organic sales growth was again volume driven, with volume also up more than 2%. All-in sales were up 3% including a one point benefit from foreign exchange. P&G tracked channel market share trends improved modestly, 27 of our 50 largest category country combinations are holding or growing share, up from 22 for the same period last year. Of those where share is still down half of less than the rate of decline obviously a positive step towards returning to growth. Ecommerce sales continue to be very strong, growing about 40% with 8 out of 10 categories growing market share. Before I take you through the earnings per share results, which are also on target, let me step back briefly and outline the impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We view the Tax Act as a significant advancement for the competitiveness of U.S. companies. When we started working in along with many others on tax reform, it was in large part a response to the previous administration stated desire to repeal deferral of U.S. taxes on offshore earnings and toll repatriation. This was the one element of the U.S. code that helped address the negative competitive aspect of the U.S.'s Global Taxation approach. So we were very concerned about its threatened repeal. The other issue which concerned us was the U.S. corporate rate which had become one of the highest in the world. With the combination of these items, we were potentially looking at a 35% tax rate on global earnings due immediately, which was more than 10 points to as much as 20 points higher than many of our internationally domicile competitors. The U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act addresses both of these concerns by reducing the tax rate on U.S. earnings to 21% and by moving from a global taxation regime to a modified territorial regime. It enables U.S. companies to remain competitive globally which maintains and creates jobs in the U.S. It facilitates the free flow of capital. And the individual aspects of the Act will hopefully in many cases stimulate consumption, net a very positive change in our view. In terms of the math, there are several pieces of this I think are worth walking through, I won't touch on every element, but I'll try to help with the largest ones. As part of the Act, U.S. companies are required to pay a tax on historical earnings generated offshore that have not yet been repatriated to the U.S. with a 15.5% tax due on unrepatriated retained earnings that are held as cash or liquid assets and an 8% tax on earnings that have been reinvested for example into manufacturing or research facilities. We are accounting for the entirety of this tax in the quarter we just completed as a non-core earnings charge of about $3.8 billion. There are several items which partially offset this charge, the most significant of which is a revaluation to reflect the new tax rate of a large net deferred tax liability position. The offsets bring the net non-core earnings charge down to a total of around $630 million. This is a non-cash charge; the tax on historical foreign earnings has been recognized now for accounting purposes, but will be paid as stipulated by the Act over an eight year period. So the cash impact will fall in future periods and will be more than offset by the cash benefit from the lower ongoing tax rate. We will be truing up the one-time charge for any evolution and policy interruption as we complete fiscal 2017-2018. For example, just last Friday, the Treasury Department provided new direction regarding which exchange rate should be used to calculate the one-time tax on foreign earnings. Now let me move to core earnings and cash impacts. There are two main core earnings benefits. First, is the lower rate on U.S. earnings of 21%. The second benefit is an even lower rate on royalty income that relates to U.S. Domiciled Intellectual Property. Most of our IP is held in the U.S. Overseas affiliates license this IP and pay the U.S. for its use. This U.S. income will now be taxed at an effective rate of about 15%. The most significant core earnings offset is the inherent disallowance under the Act of previously available U.S. tax credits. With assumed immediate repatriation of foreign earnings for accounting purposes going forward, we will also be recognizing dividend withholding taxes, taxes levied by other countries as we repatriate cash through intercompany dividends. We recognize in these as current period liabilities in the period when earnings are generated. There's a small negative P&G impact from the minimum tax on foreign earnings that is stipulated by the Act and there are other operating impacts which reduce the rate benefit. One example is the potential need to gross up reimbursements for relocation costs which under the Act become personal income to relocating employees. All told, the core earnings benefit of the Tax Act is about $135 million in the December quarter and for the fiscal year. The benefit will more than double to about $300 million in fiscal 2019 and double again to about $600 million per year on a going basis. This phase-in of benefits reflects both the period of the fiscal year for which the new rates are in effect, and the amount of credit benefit that had been built into our base plans by fiscal year. Last, but certainly not least, is cash, the cash benefit will be about $250 million this fiscal year, $200 million next fiscal year, and $450 million per year ongoing. The ongoing cash benefit is somewhat lower than the earnings benefit because of the cash payments for the one-time tax on historic retained foreign earnings which occur over the next eight years. So those are the numbers in a vacuum. The most significant benefit, as I said earlier, of U.S. tax reform for P&G is the positive impact that has on our long-term competitiveness on the 60% of our business that's currently conducted overseas and the reduced barriers for capital flow across markets. I'll talk the impact on earnings guidance and cash utilization subsequently in the guidance section of this update. I'll go now to earnings per share results for the quarter. All-in earnings per share were $0.93. This includes $0.02 per share of non-core restructuring costs and $0.24 per share of non-core charges due to the Tax Act that we just talked about. All-in earnings per share declined 68% versus the prior year. This comparison reflects the one-time tax charge in the current period and the very large gain from the beauty RMT transaction in the base period. Core earnings per share were $1.19, up 10%. Excluding the $0.05 benefit from the Tax Act, core earnings per share were $1.14, up 6%. Foreign exchange added about four points to earnings per share growth and higher commodity costs were four point headwind. Commodity prices have continued to move higher as the year has progressed approaching a $350 million after-tax impact versus year ago for the fiscal year. We knew we'd see higher pulp costs going into the year. These costs have continued to increase beyond initial forecast ranges with strong demand and some recent supply disruption. Ethylene, propylene, kerosene, and polyethylene and polypropylene resins have increased recently primarily as a result of the fall hurricanes in the Gulf, but also due to recent increases in crude pricing. Delivery costs have also been rising as demand for drivers outstrip supply. As a result, core gross margin declined 80 basis points versus year ago. 150 basis points of productivity savings were more than offset by headwinds of 90 points from higher commodity costs, 70 basis points of mixed impact, 50 basis points from pricing primarily Gillette, and 40 basis points of reinvestment in product and packaging innovation. Core SG&A cost as a percentage of sales declined 80 basis points driven by productivity savings of 40 basis points from the combination of reduced overhead, agency fee and ad production costs, and approximately 40 basis points of top-line leverage. As a result, core operating profit margin declined 10 basis points for the quarter, productivity savings were 190 basis points benefit within this. The core effective tax rate was 21% including the impacts from the Tax Act. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 91%. We repurchased $1.8 billion of shares and distributed $1.8 billion in dividends, in total $3.6 billion of value returned to shareowners this quarter. Net pre-tax act core results in line with our going-in expectations and result with the Tax Act that are ahead. We continue to accelerate top-line growth, we're continuing to increase the number of major category country combinations that are holding or growing share, we're continuing to deliver productivity savings and strong cash flow. I'm going to move now to progress against our strategic priorities. As you know, we've chosen to focus our efforts on daily use categories, where products solve problems and performance drives brand choice. In these categories, we're doubling down on meaningful superiority, products, packaging, brand communication, retail execution, and superior value in each price tier where we compete. We've raised our standard for competitive advantage in each of these areas to drive market growth and market share. We're making progress against this new higher bar judgmentally achieving it across all five touch points 40% of the time, up from 30% last year. We'll make further progress in the back half of the year with a strong innovation lineup recently and soon to be launched. I'll touch on a few examples where progress against the standard is driving both market and share growth. Fabric Care continues to drive category growth with four steps to the perfect wash. Reframing the category experience from laundry and fabric enhancers to four steps that are better together : laundry, liquid fabric enhancers, feeds, and dryer sheets. This initiative combines strong innovation across the forms and improved in-store execution, visually showcasing the better together product line up at shelf and online with renewed consumer communication.  The U.S. detergent market continues to grow fueled by P&G and primarily by unit dose. New advertising, incremental distribution and in-store communication on the four steps to the perfect wash has driven fabric enhancer category growth to almost 6% with P&G growing over 10%. We continue to strengthen our offerings to drive the fastest growing segment of the diapers category which is pants. This segment makes up 25% of the overall diapers category globally and is growing over 15%. The majority of the category growth over the next five years will be driven by the pants segment. Pampers Pants has held the number one global share position for 10 consecutive months, led by sales growth of 30% over the past 12 months behind innovation that has been brought to consumers across the world. Olay in China achieved its third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, delivering superiority across all touch points. We completely revamped our Olay Beauty Counselor program and upgraded the in-store counters with higher and tighter standards. A few months ago we launched Olay Cell Science, Olay's first ever Super peptide formula delivering visible skin transformation in 28 days. We've upgraded Olay packaging to prestige like quality and attractiveness. Our fearless of age campaign with an empowering message for consumers has further driven consumption has contributed to strong ecommerce sales that are up 80% fiscal year-to-date and is growing Olay's market share raising our game in products, package, communication point-of-sale and consumer value all leading to strong double-digit growth for Olay in China. Always Discreet has grown more than 20% reaching new record share levels across all markets behind the successful launch of Discreet Boutique Underwear that look, fit, and feel like real underwear. This superior product and strong in-store execution has driven discreet global value share above 11% up one-and-a-half points over the last three months. Boutique has reached 20% of our underwear business is 100% incremental to Always Discreet earning two share points where it is distributed. In the U.S. the adult incontinence category growth both volume and value has accelerated since the boutique launch with boutique driving 60% of that growth. We continue to develop new naturals offerings to increase the relevance of our brands and products with the naturals consumer and the increasingly environmentally concerned shopper, whether she is a millennial or a baby boomer. Meeting consumer needs related to sustainability and naturals is not new at P&G. Take laundry as an example. P&G was the first multinational company to remove phosphates from all laundry detergents without a compromising cleaning. In 2005, we introduced Tide Coldwater to promote energy efficiency with a specifically formulated detergent that helped consumers reduce energy usage by up to 50% per load, while delivering against the superior performance expectations of Tide. In 2011, we launched the ultimate detergent sustainability offering super concentrated single unit dose. Before the Tide PODS launched this segment made up 2% of the laundry category, it now represents over 15% of the laundry market and accounts for 90% of laundry category growth. We're currently launching the three chamber unit dose product in both Japan and China. Two years ago we introduced the first biobased detergent with the cleaning power of Tide in Tide Purclean with 65% biobased ingredients produced with 100% renewable wind power, electricity, in a facility operating with zero manufacturing waste to landfill. Today, Tide Purclean is growing over 50% four times faster than the natural detergent segment. This year we expanded our biobased offerings across the detergent portfolio to include GAIN BOTANICALS and Dreft Purtouch. We're doing the same in other categories. In late September, we launched Whisper pure cotton in China, our new premium pad with 100% natural cotton top sheet. Results are strong with sales double that of going-in expectations. We have launched additional feminine care natural test and learn offerings across key markets. In Baby Care, we're entering the natural segment with an offering that will include diapers and wipes. Today this segment represents over 5% of category dollars and is growing double-digits. Early testing of the offerings show a preference versus other leading natural products and broad consumer appeal. In beauty, we launched Herbal Bio renew last year made with a blend of antioxidants, aloe and sea kelp, and free of parabens, dyes, and gluten. We launched Rejoice Micellar water in China, a non silicon shampoo and conditioner. This month we're launching Pantene Micellar to bring the same benefits of a gentle cleansing shampoo and conditioner that removes impurities with no silicones, parabens, or dyes. We've also announced the acquisition of the Native natural deodorant lineup to broaden our antiperspirant and deodorants portfolio in the naturals segment. We're making packaging more sustainable with projects that expand our use of post consumer recycle plastics. One of our first applications is using reclaimed beach plastic for Head and Shoulders bottles as supply of these materials grows we will look to expand their use to other categories. In healthcare, we're launching ZzzQuil PURE Zzzs, a melatonin based sleep aid naturally free of artificial flavors, gluten, lactose, and gelatin. Our supply network transformation further enables improvements in environmental sustainability as we move manufacturing and distribution closer to consumption. Since 2010, we've reduced truck transportation kilometers by more than 25%. Over the same time period our plant sites have reduced water usage by 24% and increased our use of renewable energy to 10% with a goal of 30% in the next four years. As we reported in our most recent Citizenship Report published in November, we recently achieved our 2020 goal of reducing energy consumption at P&G facilities by 20%, four years ahead of schedule and recently we set a goal for zero manufacturing waste to landfill from all production sites by 2020. Annual sales of P&G Naturals and significantly more environmentally sustainable products like Tide and Gain unit-dosed detergents and Tide Coldwater are well over a $1 billion with many additional products just launching and more in the innovation pipeline. Innovation drives superiority and builds brand relevance across age groups including millennials. Over the past year 13 of our leading brands were market share leaders among millennial consumers including Always, Bounty, Cascade, Charmin, Crest, Dawn, Dowty, Downy, Gillette, Olay, Old Spice, Swiffer, Tampax, and Tide. Millennials do a lot of their shopping online. Last year P&G sales in ecommerce exceeded $3 billion. The goal this year is to build ecommerce sales to nearly $4.5 billion. Fiscal year-to-date our ecommerce sales growth is up nearly 40% with all of our top markets in 8 out of 10 product categories growing or holding market share. We're making good progress but we're not yet where we need to be in all categories and markets. Mainline tape diapers in China are a challenge. We've made tough choices to improve our position in grooming. We face highly capable competitors who continue to innovate their products and business models. Addressing these challenges and extending our product package demand creation superiority will continue to require investment which underscores the importance of productivity. We will continue to drive productivity improvements to lower costs and generate cash. As you know, we completed a $10 billion productivity program in fiscal 2016 and have doubled down another $10 billion starting next fiscal year. We continue to progress our supply chain transformation. Next month, we expect to start production of the first of several categories at our new state-of-the-art multi-category manufacturing facility in West Virginia. The sustainability efforts I recited earlier obviously go hand in glove with our productivity efforts contributing significantly to reductions in costs. We've been talking a lot about media transparency which has been improving. As this improves, it's clear and clear to us that there is more opportunity to eliminate waste by reducing excess frequency within and across channels, eliminating non-viewable ads, and stopping ads served to bots or adjacent to inappropriate content. Through these efforts we've been able to eliminate waste and cut losses, while simultaneously increasing reach the number of consumers we're actually connecting with by about 10%. Looking ahead, we see further cost reduction opportunity through more private market placed deals with media companies and precision media buying, fueled by data and digital technology. We continue to reinvent our agency relationships consolidating and upgrading P&G's agency capabilities to deliver the best brand building creativity. We've already reduced the number of agencies nearly 60% from 6,000 to 2,500, saved $750 million in agency and production costs, and improved cash flow by over $400 million additional through 75 day payment terms. In the next phase, we're targeting to save another $400 million reducing the number of agencies by another 50% and implementing new advertising and media agency models. We need the contribution of creative talent and are prepared to pay for that. We don't need some of the other components of the cost. We will move to more fixed and flow arrangements with more open sourcing of creative talent and production capability, driving greater local relevance, speed, and quality at lower costs. We will automate more media planning, buying, and distribution bringing more of it in-house. We are focused not just on cost productivity but also cash. An important cash productivity project has been supply chain financing which we continue to expand. This program which is a win for suppliers and for P&G has yielded over $4 billion in cash in the four years we've been driving it. Productivity improvements have been critical to offsetting the headwinds from foreign exchange and to increase in our industry-leading margins. Our aggregate 22% core operating profit margin is the third highest in the industry; we hold further advantages in below-the-line costs. We borrow at some of the most favorable rates in the industry and we have a tax rate that is among the industry's lowest leaving us with a second highest after-tax profit margin in the industry with three-and-a-half out of five years of the next productivity program still ahead of us. Productivity improvement will be critical to fund investments for sales and market share growth, while continuing to expand profit margins. Alongside all the other work we continue to evolve our organization structure and culture. We're now about six months into the implementation of the end-to-end and freedom within a framework organization models, simplifying the structure and clarifying responsibility and accountability. We're managing careers to increase mastery and supplementing our internal talent development system with skilled experienced external hiring. We are strengthening our compensation and incentive programs. We're increasing the granularity of bonus awards trying to put them much closer to the results individuals deliver. Based in part on shareholder input, the board's compensation and leadership committee has modified the performance stock program to include relative sales growth metrics and a total shareholder return modifier to ensure awards reflect performance versus external competitive benchmarks. David will talk more about each of these areas : superiority, productivity, organization and culture when we're together in a few weeks at CAGNY. Let me move now to guidance for fiscal 2018. We're maintaining the organic sales growth guidance range of 2% to 3% which will require further top-line acceleration in the back half of the year in a highly competitive and dynamic marketplace. We expect fiscal 2018 all-in sales growth of around 3%. This includes a modest net benefit from the combination of foreign exchange and acquisitions and divestitures. We're raising the top end of our core earnings per share guidance range shifting from a range of 5% to 7% to a range of 5% to 8%. We're raising the upper end of the range by a point to reflect the benefit from the Tax Act which I outlined earlier. It's not entirely clear what competitive dynamics are going to be in response to the Act. We're maintaining the bottom end of the range to reflect that uncertainty that still exists around these dynamics in our categories. We now expect the core effective tax rate on the year to be in the range of 22.5% to 23%. Looking further forward, we expect ongoing core effective tax rate in the range of 21% to 22% starting in fiscal 2019. As I've indicated earlier, the changes included in the Tax Act are broad and complex. The charges we have booked for the non-core impacts and the core effective rate may ultimately differ from our current estimates and require true-up. There is still potential for changes and regulatory interpretation of Tax Act Provisions. There may be legislative actions that arise because of the Act and our estimates of the impacts may change as we refine our calculations for earnings and exchange rates for our foreign subsidiaries. Now as you think about top-line for the remaining two quarters, please remember that the Gillette price reductions won't anniversary until Q4. We're also facing several additional near term top-line pressures including the Algerian ban on finished product imports that I mentioned, and recent VAT increase, an increase in reduced subsidies for energy and utilities in Saudi Arabia, one of our top 15 markets which will pressure near term consumption as we have clearly seen in the month of January. As you think about our earnings per share for the remaining two quarters, there will be little to no impact, little to no benefit from tax reform. The benefit from the phased-in tax rate will be offset by lost credits and deductions in higher interest and operating expenses. On a before tax basis we expect much stronger earnings growth in Q4 than in Q3. Recall that the third quarter base period benefited from several non-recurring gains including the sales of an office building in Mexico and transition services income from the beauty divestiture. We plan to deliver another year of 90% or better adjusted free cash flow productivity. This includes CapEx in the range of 5% to 5.5% of sales. We will continue our strong track record of cash returned to shareholders. We expect to pay nearly $7.5 billion in dividends this year. We're increasing our fiscal '18 share repurchase outlook from a range of $4 billion to $7 billion to a range of $6 billion to $8 billion, reflecting strong operating cash flow, continued working capital progress, and the cash benefit enabled by the Tax Act. Combined we will return between $13.5 billion and $15.5 billion of value to shareowners this fiscal following $22 billion last year. Our efforts to focus on strengthening our portfolio to extend our margin of competitive superiority to transform our supply chain to enhance our industry-leading margins to simplify our organizational structure and increase accountability are all aimed at delivering balanced top and bottom line growth that creates value over the short, mid, and long-term. Our results for the second quarter were in line with our expectations and keep us on track for the fiscal year. As I just mentioned we're maintaining top-line guidance reflecting the help from the Tax Act and the guidance range on the bottom line and are increasing our share repurchase assumptions. With that, I would now be happy to take questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citi. Wendy Nicholson : Hi good morning. Could you address the Baby Care business specifically, the weakness there surprised me because at least in track channels, your market share has actually looked pretty good. So I'm wondering number one was the weakness more international specifically can you talk about how the diaper launch is doing in China and what your plans are specifically in Baby Care to get volume growth growing again? Thank you. Jon Moeller : Sure, Wendy. Let me start with China. Our plans there behind the new initiatives are largely on track. We built share during the quarter in the Premium segment of the tape form and we continue to do very well both in the premium priced tier and the mid priced tiers with the pants business. We've grown from number five player on pants to the number one player on pants which is by far the fastest growing form of the category. As you know in China, we had a large mid-tier business and that business is declining versus year ago. We've taken some actions recently to adjust the rate of that decline but we've made some specific choices in terms of putting our priority in those premium segments and in the pant segment which are growing real faster over the long-term and are more profitable. In the U.S., as we've talked before which is obviously the largest market for us in diapers along with China, there continues to be significant retail competition which is forcing prices down to consumers while that doesn't change the price that we necessarily sell products through to these retail channels it starts driving price points in the marketplace lower which affects businesses like Luvs. So Luvs has much more competition than it has historically had and that's been coupled as well by strong pricing, strong price points on the behalf of branded competitors. So we've made some changes in our Luvs pricing as well to respond to those realities. We have a pretty exciting second half in terms of innovation in Baby Care. I talked during the call about the Pampers Pure launch which we're very excited about and we're continuing to drive innovation in the Pant segment across the world. So work still to do, I think the China dynamic will remain with us for some time, we will continue to grow faster at the top end in pants. Over time, offset in mid-tier particularly with some of the actions we've taken will diminish. We hope to be growing that business by the end of the fiscal year and clearly we hope to be growing Pampers on a global basis as we complete the year. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Olivia Tong : Good morning, thanks. With respect to the tax benefit in the past you said you aren't suffering from a lack of ideas. So I\u2019m a bit surprised that you're increasing the share repurchase plan. So as you think about it what sort of the plan longer-term for some of the benefits that you get from a lower tax rate because as I think about where you could potentially put that and price actually turned negative for the first time in a while, so you're not under investing in price and then also within that, I'm just curious where M&A potentially fits in as well? Thank you. Jon Moeller : Thanks, Olivia. We've been very clear about our intention to invest in superiority across the five touch points which we talked earlier today. That's primarily going to be focused on product, package, communication, and in-store, but where we need to sharpen value equations either at the consumer at the retail level that could also be a target for investment. We intend to continue to keep the bottom-line growing and to be growing margins through productivity which will both provide the fuel for reinvestment and for margin improvement. We really, as I've talked about many, many times before don't view pricing and promotion as high on the list in terms of our options to grow the business. We'll do it when we need to do it but there's nothing proprietary in promotion, there's nothing proprietary in price. We would much rather invest in items that where we can derive proprietary benefits over long periods of time. You mentioned the price impact on the quarter, we've held or grown price inclusive of promotion for 28 consecutive quarters until the one we just completed and for 13 consecutive years. So the preponderance of the evidence in terms of our intentionality around pricing remains. Most of the impact in the quarter we just completed was Gillette which as you know, anniversaries itself in April. And then I talked as well in the answer to Wendy\u2019s question about the pricing that we've taken on Luvs. But generally we're going to be continuing to invest in the business, driving superiority, driving sustainable competitive advantage, doing it in a responsible way, driving margin simultaneously. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Bill Chappell : Thanks, good morning. Hey Jon going back, could you just talk a little bit more about the impact in the quarter on growth, I think you talked about a retail destocking in Algeria, just maybe a little more color on those two issues. Would they have any impact as we move into 3Q or 4Q and do you see any other especially on the inventory destock affecting 3Q or 4Q? Jon Moeller : Sure. So the first thing we mentioned was the pricing impact for Gillette which as you know will roll off in Q4 and that was 30 basis points of impact within the quarter. It would still be with us next quarter but then it will anniversary itself. The second thing we've talked about was 40 basis points impact of U.S. retail inventory reductions. And I obviously won't get into specific customers but in one of our large customers for example spell through another words sale of their products in P&G, P&G Brands was up 1% in the month of December sales to that customer were down 3.5%. So you see a significant contraction in inventory that's happening there and we're seeing that fairly broadly across the board. We expect that will continue into the next quarter because most of the retailer's fiscal year ends are in January. Obviously that's not a well that's I wouldn't expect that trend to disappear, it's not it's largely a one-time item and shouldn\u2019t be affecting us at that level of magnitude going forward. So there should be some pickup there. The Algerian situation isn't a retail inventory situation, it's a government regulation situation where they have forbidden the import of finished product in our categories and most of our business in Algeria supplied through import. We expect that situation but we're obviously working many alternatives and working very productively with the authorities but we expect that to continue to be a constraint in the third quarter. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Steve Powers : Great, thanks good morning. Jon I was hoping you could just unpack the negative margin mix a bit more in the quarter with China presumably better, Skin Care, SK-II better, baby worse are expected out of expected margins should be a bit better? Grooming declines notwithstanding. So could you just I guess elaborate on where the incremental mix headwinds are coming from perhaps as it relates to the U.S. inventory reductions but I'm just really trying to understand how mixes could evolve over the balance of the year and I guess above and beyond that whether what you called out as negative mix is maybe better described as another form of reinvestment above and beyond the pricing adjustments and the investments in innovation that you've mentioned. So just I guess in a nutshell where is the negative mix coming from and how is it likely to evolve from here? Thanks. Jon Moeller : Sure, Steve. The simplest way to think about it is at the level of geographic mix. We delivered over 2% organic sales growth on the quarter. The U.S. was about 1%, slightly over 1% with the balance obviously growing faster than that and as you know our margins in the U.S. are much higher than the balance. We expect in the prior question I talked about, most of those headwinds being U.S. centric i.e. Gillette pricing and the retail inventory reductions. So we would expect absent any other changes to accelerate our growth rate in the U.S. in the back half which should mitigate may not eliminate but mitigate the margin difference. Remember historically whenever we've been in a position where the balance of the world is growing at a faster rate than the U.S., there typically is a negative some element of negative margin mix. Now we're working hard obviously from a productivity standpoint and in pricing where it's appropriate behind more superior offerings clearly doing that in China to mitigate that impact going forward. But in large part it was for the quarter geographic mix. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the Gillette innovation. I'm more surprised there is kind of no mention of it, so a lot of new products are unprecedented coming to market, if you could talk a little bit about retailers to port marketing plans when we should start to see that and particularly in terms of retailer anyone that's particularly getting behind it and what we should be watching for? Thanks. Jon Moeller : So first of all, let me just talk about the business in total in the U.S. in grooming, generally the intervention plan that we've put in place is working very well. We grew volume for the third straight quarter on the U.S. male shave care business, quarter we just completed volume was up 6% for the category with male shave up 8% and the volume share trends are also improving with share growing 0.6 points in the last quarter. We've just brought the new items to market and are beginning to the commercialization activities behind them; retailer uptake on those items has been encouraging, but really nothing to report from an off-take standpoint yet. Operator : Next we'll go to Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj : Hi guys. So I wanted to go back to pricing again and I totally appreciate we got to see the 28 quarters of flat to positive pricing. But the pricing trend has clearly been a bit downwards and arguably you've been pricing below your combined kind of market inflation rates for years now? And then of course this quarter is a negative price, while commodities are going up. And so this kind of pricing down and commodities up to be fair, isn't inconsistent with what we're seeing from your competitors either right, so I'm not blaming you just to be clear at least not this time. Your CPG pricing not keeping up with inflation seems to be kind of the trend now. So I'm trying to get a better sense of from an industry perspective as you guys see it, what's driving that, I mean is it the retailers especially in the U.S. really pushing back, is that the consumer saying gosh these are commoditized. Is it fragmentation or commoditization it's going to be combination of those but if you can elaborate and do you kind of think that's the new world we're living in here that's the new reality for CPG that that investor should be concerned about pricing power much less than it was before or do you think this is a transition and we're just going to get through this and everything's going to be fine later on. So thank you for that. Jon Moeller : Sure. There is a lot within that. Let me go piece by piece. As it relates to the relationship between pricing and commodities, well commodity costs are increasing and they are clearly affecting both our gross margin, our bottom line as we outlined. They have not increased to the point where typically pricing can be taken and hold and held. We're still at a point where if we were to reflect the commodity costs and pricing they would result in price increases that would be relatively modest and that typically wouldn't either A be followed or B be pass-through on shelf. So that's part of the dynamic that you're seeing there and I would assume that's true for other companies though that I won't -- I won't comment on that. In general, slow market growth which we currently face also leads to more competitive behavior in terms of pricing. And that's why in many -- in many ways we've chosen to focus our portfolio where we have which is in categories where performance drives brand choice and why we're doubling down on advantage within those categories to ensure that that performance advantage is clear and noticeable to consumers. We see in many parts of the world, including the U.S., including China, significant growth still at the high end of the market and many categories more growth at the high end than in the low end. So I think you're absolutely right to point to this as a pain point kind of in the immediate present. I think our strategy is designed to find the best path to a better place which is higher category growth driven by products that deliver higher benefit for consumers and I don't see pricing as it's having gone through the sea shift that should reflect your view on the industry long-term. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : Hey good morning. So Jon, if you look at divisional profit ex-corporate expense, it was flat year-over-year in Q2 after a decline in Q1. As you just talked about pricing was negative in the quarter for the first time in more than seven years, so I think commodity pressure as you look going forward you guys have spent a lot of time, money and effort in turning around market share and driving improved performance there, is there any shift going forward in terms of how you drive profit growth. Any strategy tweaks in terms of accelerating cost cutting, taking greater pricing et cetera, how should we think about sort of the balance between market share focus and profit growth going forward? Jon Moeller : We believe as you know in a balanced approach, we think it's the only way to sustainably build value in this industry over periods of time, we need to be growing our top-line both our markets and our market shares. At the same time, we need to be growing margin. These strategic initiatives and focus areas that I talked about earlier both productivity and the doubling down on competitive advantage and superiority both works in our favor in that regard going forward. So everything that we're doing as I mentioned in the prepared remarks is designed to drive both in a balanced way. We have more work to do as your question obviously points out, I mentioned for example going even much further in the area of advertising, strengthening our programs, increasing reach, but really making a serious effort to eliminate costs that just aren't serving anybody's purpose in that space. We're doing that across the income statement, across the balance sheet, but it continues to be a very, very significant focus. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Bonnie Herzog : Thank you, good morning. I have a question on your market share Jon, it does sound like broadly your market share losses continue to persist. So could you update us on your thoughts as to when you expect to stabilize your shares and then ultimately to increase them, is it realistic to expect to see this by the end of FY '18? And then you did talk a lot about continued investments, so it does seem like you need to increase investments in R&D and then advertising to begin to gain market share and just if that is in fact true, could you just give us a sense to the expected increases for both? Thank you. Jon Moeller : We did increase advertising in the quarter to be clear, we're up about 2%, I continue to expect that we're going to be investing in both R&D and advertising, we're obviously just constructing our plans for next fiscal year. So I don't really have any specifics to share with you there. But its part and parcel of again a very focused around on daily use categories more performance solves -- drives brand choice and product solve problems. We want to be in a superior position both from a communications standpoint and from a product efficacy standpoint in each of those. And as I've indicated, I do believe that our productivity efforts give us the ability to do just that while simultaneously building margins. In terms of market share, we expect to be growing, if you just look at the guidance we've delivered call it 1.5% organic sales growth to-date to get to the 2% to 3% guidance range for the year requires acceleration in the back half. Our markets are growing about 2.5% on an average, so we would expect to get there in the back half of the year. Obviously though what you're going to see which you're painfully aware of may look something somewhat different than that not in terms of aggregate results but in the track channel numbers simply because there's so much more growth occurring in the non-tracked channels where we're building a disproportionate share. But of course we our objective is to hold and build share in all channels. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : Thanks, good morning, Jon. I wanted to pick up on the last question with respect to category growth which it sounds like you still expect 2.5% so that's unchanged in the prior call? Could you talk a little bit about emerging markets broadly, it sounds like some of your competitors are talking about perhaps we found a bottom here if not some slight improvement but that doesn't sound like your expectation. So maybe you can talk a little bit about that and then just secondarily do you expect any benefit from a consumer perspective with respect to individual tax rates moving lower and given the company's premium SKUs. So any commentary there would be helpful? Thanks. Jon Moeller : Sure. If you look at developing market category growth, it's around last quarter was around 5.5% and that's up a little bit, we saw an increase an uptick in December. We saw the same thing in developed markets. So I'm hopeful though I don't have any kind of a crystal ball here in front of me that that maybe we have seen the nadir in terms of market growth rates. With the growth of the global economy is pretty much everywhere which of course can come unhinged at any moment. That also bodes well but we're basically forecasting market growth in line with most recent history i.e. the last couple of quarters and will be beneficiaries if it comes in better than that. But I don't get too excited obviously over a move in one month i.e. the month of December but if you had to state the future on that one month, it is a slightly better picture than I've done the case previously. Obviously to the extent that disposable income increases as a result of the Tax Act for some consumers, we would hope that that plays through into higher consumption and we do think that that there's a chance we could disproportionately benefit from that given as you rightly point out that many of our products do require slightly higher outlay. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge Research. Jonathan Feeney : Good morning, thanks very much. It\u2019s with great reputation that say I\u2019m following up on Ali's question but going after pricing a little bit, I wanted -- you look at your strategy it seems to be kind of somewhat of a counterpoint to a strategy that's prevalent in food and particularly 3G and Kraft Heinz, which has been whole wave. Many other areas are staples too. You could look at and Anheuser-Busch taking price at the expense of volumes, segmenting the market reaching more for premium consumers and trying to get people to pay more and there is a lot in there, there's relationship with retailers. Why I ask right now is this segmentation which it appears to be in U.S. grooming seems to set you up to do something like that in that particular category and I'm wondering if that's a fair interpretation where you can now maybe price a little bit better, it may reach and try to grab more of that value to consumers presumably you're bringing a lot more value to and are there other pockets of your maybe portfolio where similar strategy is warranted or maybe I'm even off base in interpreting that way? Any comments you have would be helpful on all those lines. Thank you. Jon Moeller : I don't think you're at all off base and again our strategy which focuses on building advantage should allow us to do exactly which you described and you see that playing out through many parts of the product portfolio. If you just look at some of the examples we talked about earlier that's Tide PODS or scent beads or dryer sheets those are all premium offerings on a price per use basis. The same is true with the item that we're dramatically changing the category growth rate within adult incontinence which is this new boutique underwear, I mean that's a clear move to further capture more value in the category. So the strategy sets us up very well to do exactly what you describe we need to do it in an intelligent way, we need to do it in a way which builds value for shareholders, the combination of price and performance and we'll continue to get out that. I mean you don't build price for 28 consecutive quarters and then walk away from it, that's not we're headed here but there will be times when again in response to other moves that have been made, we need to maintain our competitiveness in the market and we're just not going to accept significant share loss from not doing that. Operator : Next we'll go to Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : Hi, good morning. So Jon, I just want to go back to exactly this question. And just to balance the top-line growth and the margin and can you please comment on the additional cash investments on that line on pricing and price mix. From your new EPS guidance that now includes a much lower tax rate, it seems that you became more conservative on how the cost saves will flow into the bottom line. So especially in the core operating margin perspective as you take out obviously as you decompose your guidance, is that a reflection of this competitive environment U.S. Baby and the destocking from retailer that you just mentioned, so or EM is taking longer to show results despite a pickup in beauty. So I just want to -- so I just want to think about strategically as you step back and you're going to invest more in prices in other categories should recovery share besides what you did for grooming and Luvs. So wanted to kind of elaborate more on that? Thank you. Jon Moeller : First of all any Tax Act related impact is future focused, this is only effective as of January 1st and we're sitting here today talking about results through December 31. If you just think about where we've taken our guidance as a result of the tax change, we took it from 5% to 7% to 5% to 8% up so there is no change in terms of the inherent amount of reinvestment that's planned. All we've changed in our guidance number is reflects the fact that there's a lower tax rate. Our strategy has not changed in terms of how we intend to compete, how we want to be building markets not diluting markets, nothing there has changed. Broadly the competitive environment is not significantly changed. I mean for example just look at private label as a metric as to whether there's a big trade down that's occurring within the consumer set, private label last three years in Europe has been flat as a pancake. That's the largest private label market in the world, there are categories where it increases from time to time but generally we're not seeing a reason to chase lower prices as a result of private label. In North America, over those three year periods private label is up 0.2 share points, it's up in three categories currently and in two of those categories we're building share. So I do not see, I do not expect at all a change in our focus and strategy to deliver value accretive offerings which drive market growth and our market share disproportionately as part of that, all while increasing margins. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello with Raymond James. Joe Altobello : Hey guys, good morning. Just a couple of quick ones, I guess first on China, I'm not sure Jon if you gave us a growth number for this quarter. I think last quarter was up eight but that had about two points of pull forward ahead of the Singles' Day? And then secondly in beauty clearly a standout this quarter, how sustainable is the positive mix benefit you're seeing in the beauty segment? Thanks. Jon Moeller : So China up, you rightly pointed out was up eight last quarter, it was up six in the quarter that we just completed and some really strong so well on track for our mid-single-digits estimate for the year. Some really strong progress in parts of the beauty business, some really strong progress in grooming, strong progress in laundry, feminine care was up double-digits, so overall very, very good. In terms of the positive mix or let me take the question a different way, do we think that SK-II growth is sustainable certainly at attractive levels? Yes. More importantly, the balance of the beauty business continues to be very healthy. I mentioned Olay growth -- or I may not but Olay grew 3% in China for the quarter. Overall global skincare growth was up every part of our beauty business was up versus year ago, hair care was up 3% as an example with all brands up with one exception which was Vidal. So very broad progress in beauty across geographies. So I think that that is sustainable, the main inflection point going forward is to address a couple of the items that that we've talked about on this call and that you've asked about which are grooming and the big help from an index standpoint there just ahead of us and to address some of the issues in baby care which we're being very proactive about. Operator : And your final question comes from Jon Andersen with William Blair. Jon Andersen : Hey good morning. Thank you for the question. I think you indicated earlier that you're building share disproportionately in non-tracked channels and I'm wondering one you said did I interpret that right is that accurate and then if so what have you been able -- how have you been able to kind of accomplish that? I mean, what is it about the way you're positioning your brands, the investments you're making in non-tracked channels or the consumer within those channels that's kind of enabling you to do that and I know there's an online component and there may be some other non-tracked channels that are large that you're having success in. Thanks. Jon Moeller : First as it relates to ecommerce, we're building share broadly across our large markets in ecommerce and we've built share in 8 out of 10 categories in the last quarter. So that continues to grow disproportionately. I mentioned, I think in the prepared remarks for example Olay growing 80% in ecommerce in China for the quarter. More broadly as you talk about non-track channels and we've talked about some of this before, If you look at this, let's just take the U.S. as an example what's really happening from a retail standpoint or one could argue is happening from a retail standpoint is that shopping is moving to more limited assortment channels. So the club channels growing very quickly, the discounter channel, small format stores and online which we would argue is a very limited assortment shopping experience, there's obviously a broad array of assortment that's available but the amount of that assortment that's actually access and considered in a typical ecommerce shopping trip is extraordinarily low. And generally, we do well in low assortment environments, you want to feel, if you're going to carry a low assortment or if your shopper is going to expose themselves to a relatively limited assortment, you want it to be that assortment which drives your business as a retailer and that tends to be leading brands. So you see in ecommerce, a disproportionate appearance in the first and second page of a search for leading brands in many of our categories. You see in discount channels a willingness to carry branded products in some categories but typically only, only one or two brands or the market leader. So I would expect and that doesn't mean that we have any inherent right to win in those channels, we need to be very, very competitive and are focused in doing that wherever consumers want to shop. But those dynamics have tended to work in our favor and I would expect would continue going forward. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation, you may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

P&G would like to remind you that today's discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10K, 10Q and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from these projections. Also as required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the Company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on the underlying growth trends of the business and has posted on its Investor Relations website www.pginvestor.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP and other financial measures. Now, I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller. Jon Moeller : Good morning, I'm pleased to be joined this morning by David Taylor, P&G's Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, and John Chevalier our Vice President, Investor Relations. I'm going to start this morning with a brief review of the Company's results for the January/March quarter and our outlook for the fiscal year. David will provide additional perspective on the year and update on key strategic focus areas and perspective on the announcements we made this morning regarding the planned acquisition of Merck KGaA's OTC healthcare portfolio and the dissolution of our over-the-counter healthcare joint venture with Teva. We will then open up the call for questions. This was a challenging quarter in a very tough environment. We grew through the challenges delivering modest top and bottom line growth. We continued improving productivity while investing in our brands. As a result, we remain on track to deliver our fiscal year objectives, but we must and will do better than this. The ecosystems in which we operate around the world are being disrupted and transformed. We must change at an even faster rate winning through superiority, stronger cost and cash productivity and a strengthened organization and culture. Good news, we increased the dividend by 4%, the 62nd consecutive year the P&G dividend has been increased. We also announced this morning significant moves that will strengthen our hand in OTC healthcare positively contributing to the Company's growth and profitability. Overall volume of value share trends continued to improve. Volume shares now in line with prior year levels improving in both developed and developing markets. Seven of 10 global categories are now growing or holding volume share. Value share is down 30 basis points all in and adjusting for intra-category mix impact is down just 10 basis points. Several large businesses are moving to positive share trends. Feminine Care and Skin and Personal Care shares are growing. Global Shave Care value share is now in line with prior year on both a three and a six month basis. Fabric Care, Home Care and Personal Health Care are all growing share. Sales growth has been challenging in a very difficult market environment. We have large businesses in several difficult markets Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Nigeria, Brazil collectively more than a 30-basis point top-line headwind. Retail trade transformation in the U.S. is reshaping our categories. Rapid shifts to e-commerce and aggressive inventory management, trade inventory reductions, primarily in the U.S. drove strong organic sales down by roughly a point this quarter. From a business standpoint, we're not where we need to be on two large businesses, Baby Care and grooming. David will discuss both. The balance of the Company portfolio is growing organic sales over 3% fiscal year-to-date. We have opportunities continued to improve noticeable product, packaging, communication, go-to-market, and value superiority of our offerings across the portfolio and to fuel this with even increased levels of productivity, each of which we are committed to do. All-in sales were up 4% including about 3 point benefit from the net of foreign exchange acquisitions and divestitures, organic sales grew 1%. Organic sales growth was again volume driven with volume up 2%. We delivered solid organic sales growth in Fabric Care, Home Care, Feminine Care, Personal Health Care and Skin and Personal Care. Looking geographically, we delivered mid single-digit growth in Greater China, Japan, France and the Philippines; high single growth in Russia; double-digit organic sales growth in India and Turkey. E-commerce sales continue to be very strong, up more than 30% fiscal year-to-date. We are holding or growing e-commerce market share in 8 of our 10 product categories. This growth was partially offset by results in Baby Care and Grooming, both of which were down this quarter versus the prior year. Mix mainly from strong growth of premium priced products added 1 point to organic sales growth. Pricing rounded to a 2 point headwind on organic sales. On its face, the rounded number may appear like a substantial increase in pricing investment, unrounded it\u2019s about 1.5 points, about 30 basis points different than last quarter with some factors driving the pricing now starting to annualize. U.S. Gillette pricing interventions reduced organic sales by about 30 basis points. We annualized the price change at the start of this month and we expect stronger sales going forward. The U.S. Oral Care business recently rescinded the list price increase they've taken last year in the U.S., which left us operated at an unsustainable price premium. This dynamic is causing a short-term negative price impact as well that would start annualize in July. Fabric and Home Care pricing is lower due to promotional investments to maintain competitiveness in the U.S. and Europe. These two will annualize later this calendar year. Looking forward, we will continue to ensure our brands inclusive of product performance, remain an excellent competitive value for consumers. This will include price increases and mix improvement as we bring new meaningful benefits to market. We will also price to offset rising commodity costs when the degree of the cost impact warrants it and competitive realities allow it. With this plus the annualization of key investments, we currently expect to return to positive price trends some time next fiscal year. On the bottom line, all-in earnings per share were $0.95, up 2% versus the prior year. This includes $0.04 per share of non-core restructuring costs and $0.01 of non-core charges related to the tax act. Core earnings per share were $1, up 4%. Our operating margin declined to 100 basis points. Our gross margin declined to 110 basis points due mainly to higher commodity and freight costs. Core SG&A cost decreased 10 basis points as a percentage of sales. Productivity savings and cost of goods and SG&A were a 310 basis point benefit for the quarter. The core effective tax rate was 21%; 2 points below the year ago level due mainly to the impact of the U.S. tax act. This benefit was partially offset by increased interest expense and currency swap cost as we optimized international cash management under the new U.S. tax laws. The rate was somewhat lower than we anticipated last quarter as we continue to gain a deeper understanding of the provisions enacted as part of the tax act. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was a strong 95%. We will continue to make good improvements in working capital as we leverage our supply chain financing initiatives. We repurchased $1.4 billion of shares and distributed $1.8 billion in dividends in total $3.2 billion of value returned to shareowners this quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we increased the dividend by 4%, the 62nd consecutive annual increase and a 128th consecutive years P&G has paid a dividend. Moving to guidance for fiscal 2018, we're maintaining our guidance range for organic sales growth of 2% or 3%. We're at 1.4% fiscal year-to-date leaving as at the low end of this range potentially rounded up to 2% for the full year. We expect fiscal 2018 all in sales growth of about 3%. This includes a net benefit from the combination of foreign exchange acquisitions and divestitures. We're raising our outlook for core earnings per share growth from a range of 5% to 8% to a range of 6% to 8%. Commodities are projected to be a $350 million after tax headwind for the year consistent with the outlook we provided last quarter. Transportation costs are now a $200 million headwind for the year. Foreign exchange is roughly $175 million after tax benefit. The combined impact of commodities, transportation and foreign exchange are $0.14 per share impact on core earnings per share, a four point drag on core earnings per share growth. Despite these headwinds, we expect a return to gross margin and operating margin improvement in the fourth quarter, driven by strong productivity progress while maintaining investments in our brands. We now expect the core effective tax rate for the year to be in the range of 22% to 22.5% about a half point lower than our previous outlook. As we discussed last quarter, the changes included in the U.S. tax act are broad and complex. The charges we booked for the non-core impacts and the core effective rate may ultimately differ from our current estimates and require further true up. There's still potential for changes and regulatory interpretation of tax act provisions. There may be legislative actions that arise because of the act and our estimates of the impacts may change as we refine our calculations for earnings and exchange rates for our foreign subsidiaries. We're also increasing our guidance for adjusted free cash flow productivity from 90% to approximately 95%, reflecting strong year-to-date results in our outlook for the fourth quarter. This guidance includes capital spending in the range of 5 to 5.5% of sales. Fiscal 2018 will be another year of significant cash return to shareholders. We expect to pay nearly $7.5 billion dollars in dividends and repurchase shares in the range of $6 billion to $8 billion this year. Combined return between 13.5 to 15.5 billion dollars of value to shareowners, following 22 billion last fiscal year and 16 billion in fiscal 2016. In summary, we're growing the top and bottom line in a difficult environment with improving market share trends. We're driving cost and cash productivity, returning cash to shareowners, investing for the long-term health and competitiveness of our brands and strengthening our OTC healthcare hand. I'll now turn over to David, who'll talk more about our strategic priorities, the baby and grooming businesses and the acquisitions we announced this morning. David Taylor : Thanks Jon. Before I talk about the longer term strategic choices we've made, I want to be very clear about something. This is not business as usual at P&G. We will make additional changes needed to accelerate progress. The strategy needed to deliver balanced top and bottom-line growth requires accelerated progress against the five elements of superiority, product, packaging, brand communication, retail execution and value, both consumer and customer as well as stronger progress in productivity to fund these changes. We also recognized and are taken additional actions to make the needed organizational changes to enable greater speed, local agility and accountability. While our plan is to clearly showing evidence of progress in many areas, we have not yet tied it all together to deliver the industry leading balanced growth in value creation we expect of ourselves. Before I go further, I want to underscore a point that Jon just made, about how we\u2019re managing this fiscal year. We\u2019ve made a deliberate choice to keep investing in product and package improvements, sales resources, marketing and consumer value despite profit pressure from commodity cost and sluggish sales growth to continue to strengthen the long-term and health and competitiveness of our brands. Now one example of the additional interventions made include the additional $200 to $300 million of savings to mitigate a portion of the investments needed and deliver our fiscal year objectives, but more is needed to fuel the top plan and deliver share growth and what has been a more challenging environment. What we won\u2019t do is sacrifice the long-term health of the business by cutting import investments. As you know our portfolio is daily used categories were products solve problems that consumers care about and perform drives brand choice. We understand what it takes to win in all 10 of our core categories. In brand country combinations where we judge ourselves to be noticeably superior in at least four to five elements that we\u2019ve talked, we\u2019re seeing consistent meaningful improvement in the financial measures to success household penetration, which is beginning new users, market growth, value share growth, sales growth and profit. However, there is still too many brand country combinations where we aren\u2019t superior in at least four of the elements and then these parts of the business we\u2019re not growing at the rate we need to. I\u2019m going to give some very clear examples where we\u2019ve not delivered yet and we\u2019re taking additional steps to address this. First, Baby Care, Baby Care is our largest improvement opportunity. The challenges we faced are market specific and are very well understood. We\u2019re addressing them quickly and they\u2019ve taken longer than planned to resolve, but recent trends in China on our global pants in naturals launch illustrate that we can make progress with important growing segments. Now, we need to get the total brand growing across the key markets that is the next step. I\u2019ll give you a little more detail on China baby because I know it\u2019s a high interest area. Overall, diaper organic sales in China were up 2% this quarter. This is important turning point, not the end point, but the first quarter of growth in 16 quarters. We\u2019re getting our portfolio adjusted and we\u2019re getting the capacity and plans in place to win. This compares to a 12% decline at the first half of the year. Clearly, we\u2019re making progress and what\u2019s driving the progress and improvements is pant style diapers and premium taped diapers. We\u2019re starting to win at the fastest growing segments. Now, they\u2019ll all say the declines in mid tier tapped diapers while our mid tier tape diapers account for about half of our diaper sales in the segment itself is declining into double digit rate. We need to make and are making the needed the interventions to stabilize that segment. But clearly success needs to be winning big on the growing forms whilst stabilizing mainline. If not to plan is it working but clearly its taking more time to stabilize the mainline this distant plan. Let me move to the U.S., here we faced a very different set of challenges. The market is changing and some customers are aggressively pursuing private label with aggressive pricing. The lower private label pricing has been a real challenge particularly for our Loves brands. While we've taken some steps to restore Loves' competitiveness, it hasn\u2019t had the desired effect yet. For perspective, prices are down almost 20% in some areas. We are taking more action including marketing, in-store presence, and where needed value adjustments. Looking around the world, Pampers is a large brand in many difficult markets that Jon mentioned earlier in Middle-East, Africa and Brazil. We are going to start to annualize some of these market specific dynamics over the next few quarters. We've also had a tough period in Europe, which has started to reverse. A clear bright spot for Baby Care is the continued progress of Pampers' pants. This segment makes up 25% of the global diaper category and is growing at a mid-teen rate. Pants style diapers now account for 27% of all diaper changes, up 3.5 points in the last year. Majority of global diaper market growth over the next five years will be driven by pants style products, so it's absolutely critical that we win here. Pampers pants is held the number one global value share position for more than a year currently at about 28% of the form and is extended its lead against the highly capable set of competitors. Another business that's been difficult to grow at our target rates is our Grooming business. We made a very instead of tough choices to improve our position in grooming in the U.S. a year-ago and we're seeing some positive progress. The U.S. male shave care business grew volume for the fourth straight quarter with male shaving systems up 10% this quarter. We expect the strong shipment growth -- shipment volume growth we've delivered over the last year to translate in the stronger sales growth now that the price changes annualizing this quarter. This is starting to play out as we're growing volume share and value share in the past one and three month basis in the U.S. Ultimately, our objective is to grow the number of users of Gillette blades and razors. The volume trends to be all encouraging. This is a big improvement following years of declines as of many as 2 million users, and we know we're now facing a new challenge on Gillette in the U.S. where value to your competitors expanding the in-store distribution this quarter, and some of the competitors are expanding their direct-to-consumer proposition to new markets in Europe. We see these. They are not surprises and we have strong plans in place to support Gillette. When we get the superiority model in place, we stimulate market growth and market share growth. I shared a quiet of few of these examples when we talked at the CAGNY Conference in February. Our Fabric Care business in the U.S., Japan and several markets in Europe are Always Discreet Incontinence products SK-II, Olay in China, and Fairy and Dawn Hand dishwashing liquids. I also shared that we need to respond to a changing world and the changing consumer set of needs. One obvious area is increased demand for natural and sustainable products. First, the couple of comments on the sustainability consumers, here we've had a number of innovations. They include products like Tide, Gain and Ariel unit those detergents. The most compacted detergents available. On the natural side, we are getting to gain and getting new with conviction with brands like Tide Purclean, Gain Botanicals and Dreft Purtouch, they're bio-based olefins and deliver outstanding cleaning performance to consumers want in addition to the naturals profile. In FemCare, we've launched Whisper pure cotton in the China with the 100% natural cotton top sheet. Pure cotton is off to a very strong start with sales more than double our ingoing expectations. In Baby Care, we're expanding distribution of Pampers' pure protection diapers made with no fragrance, parabens or chlorine bleach. And Pampers' Aqua Pure Wipes made with 99% water and premium cotton. So far the retailer support has been very good and early consumer reviews are encouraging. For perspective, already our share of in-store is passing several category incumbents in this space that had been in the market much longer. Consumers want performance and more natural ingredients and less of an environmental footprint. P&G brands can deliver that to them. One other example is our recently launched ZzzQuil PURE Zzzs. This is a melatonin based sleep aid, free of artificial flavors, gluten, lactose, and gelatin also with good distribution results. These organic innovations strengthen our brand equities and attract new users to brands they already know, but now for the combination of performance and added natural and sustainability benefits they want. In many cases, a strong brand can carry this segment. In other cases, we\u2019ll need additional brands. We\u2019ve augmented these organic innovations with recent acquisitions international space. Native, a natural deodorant, and Snowberry Skin Care, a Naturals' brand based in New Zealand. We remained open to whatever it takes to make sure that we win in this fast growing segment. Next, I would like to comment a little bit on the strengthening of the Personal Health Care portfolio, a category we have previously identified as very attractive to us. Today, we are announcing to be a meaningful step forward. I am sure you\u2019ve all read, we\u2019ve agreed with Teva to terminate our PGT partnership effective July 1. We operated a very successful JV with Teva for nearly seven years. We grew organic sales at a compound average rate of almost 8%. However, we and Teva have concluded that our strategies and priorities going forward are no longer aligned. The partnership accomplished everything we intended and I want to thank Teva's management, employees who work side-by-side with us to make it such a success. We are moving post Teva to strengthen our OTC capabilities and growth opportunities to with the acquisition of Merck's consumer healthcare business. Merck's talent and portfolio is a near perfect replacement for the capability and scale lost by dissolving the PGT JV, bringing the significant technical and commercial capability in-house that will complement the capabilities that already reside in P&G\u2019s global consumer health care business. This deal adds a portfolio of about $1 billion in annual sales primarily in Europe, Latin America and Asia. It has been growing mid-to-high single digits. Another benefit of this acquisition is that Merck's OTC brands bring benefit to new therapeutic areas. They cover a range of treatment areas including relieving muscle, joint, and back pain; colds and headaches as well as supporting physical activity and mobility. Many of treatments -- treatment areas are not currently addressed in our current P&G portfolio. Currently P&G\u2019s OTC business generates over $2 billion in annual sales and has been a growth and value creation leader for P&G, delivering profitable mid single-digit growth. Our portfolio includes the single largest consumer health care brand in the world Vicks, with over $1 billion in annual sales. With Vicks, we are leader in OTC cough cold treatments and in digestive health with the Metamucil, Pepto-Bismol and Align brands. We see several areas where Merck's capabilities can accelerate P&G\u2019s brands and businesses. We believe Personal Health Care will continue to be a financially attractive category. It\u2019s a huge category at about $230 billion in sales and with strong profit margins. The three megatrends that are supported growth of OTC healthcare for the last decade, and they should continue for many years to come. First the aging population, today they're about 650 million people age 65 or over. This is projected to more than double to about 1.6 billion people by 2050. Over the same time period, the global average lifespan is projected to increase by almost 8 years. Second, as people age, they are focusing more on wellness instead of associating old with a number. People are associating age with how they feel and the quality of their life. And the third big one is consumers are taking more control of their health and wellness, proactively seeking information on products and services that improve their quality of life. In addition, both public and private sectors are trying to mitigate rising healthcare costs. Given this demographic and societal context, consumers in developed markets already spent a substantial amount of discretionary income on health and wellness. And as incomes grow in emerging markets, they are also spending more to manage their family's health. As a result, we continue to believe that companies with the best consumer insights with meaningful consumer driven innovations deliver on trusted brands will be best positioned to capitalize on these trends. Leveraging leading capabilities, technologies and brand assets to solve problems for consumers and improve their lives, completely consistent with the strategy for the whole of P&G. Now, I hope you can see, OTC healthcare is a very attractive market and we're excited to add Merck's brands and talent to P&G. Now, I'll turn it over to Jon to give you some more details on the financial implications for P&G of these transactions including the dissolution of the PGT joint venture with Teva. Jon Moeller : The Procter & Gamble-Teva joint venture will continue to operate through June, the end of our fiscal year; and the Merck deal will close outside of the fiscal year. So, there's no impact from either transaction on fiscal 2018 forecasts or results. Completion of the Merck consumer health care transaction is of course subject to customary, antitrust, reviews and approvals, while we don't anticipate issues it's difficult to predict precisely when that transaction will close. If we assume the Merck transaction closes at the end of the calendar year, we expect that we will add about $500 million to P&G all in sales and will be neutral to organic sales, core earnings per share and all in earnings per share growth in fiscal 2019. It will be accretive after that, growing at a faster rate and the balance of the Company at very attractive margins. We don't expect significant impacts to capital allocation choices and obviously have full line of sight to the deal, as we made the decision to increase the dividend by more than we did in the prior year. David Taylor : Thanks Jon. We're excited about the potential of this combination creates to continue strong profitable growth of our personal health care business and the balance of the portfolio we're expanding into new relevant benefit areas, amidst these several organic expansions in the natural space. We're solving more problems for consumers Always Discreet in female incontinence except these in fabric enhancers, and we're innovating quicker and more cost-effectively using lean innovation techniques. We're making progress but we face highly capable competitors who continued to innovate their products and business models, addressing these challenges and extending our product package and demand creation superiority will require investment which underscores the importance of productivity. We will continue to drive productivity improvement to lower cost and generate cash. This must accelerate even from today's pace. We completed a $10 billion productivity program in fiscal 2015 when the second year of a five year program targeting to deliver up to another $10 billion of the savings. I\u2019ll give you another example of where it's not business as usual for P&G and we\u2019re going to accelerate or pace of change, includes our supply chain transformation and the work we\u2019re going to do reinvent the media supply chain. We\u2019ve talked with you before about the progress we\u2019re making to transform our supply chain. We\u2019re starting production of the first of several categories at our new state-of-the-art multi-category manufacturing facility West Virginia. You\u2019ve probably heard about the changes we\u2019re making in the media supply chain and our work with agencies. We\u2019re taking big steps to reinvent the media supply chain and how our brands work with agencies. And we\u2019re pioneering a new approach is to dramatically improve our brand building. Agency reinvention is attempting to raise the bar in superior brand communication with greater productivity on non-working marketing spending we create the means to reinvest in maybe and sampling to drive growth. We started with upgrading and consolidating agencies from 6,000 to 2,500. They\u2019ve been 750 million through 2017. The next phase which goes to 2021 consolidates further to 1,250 agencies and saves another 400 to reinventing agency models. I mentioned just a few of the biggest changes. They include a fixed inflow model where we structure a fixed retainer with the core agency for work like large campaign supplemented with open sourcing agencies on an in and out basis for a flow to the work model. People first approach where we identified the star creative talent we want in our businesses from across agencies and bringing them together for better creativity importantly at the speed of the market and in-sourcing work like media planning that can be done at greater value inside P&G. New media, new support models, some with, some without the TV led communication plan. Our key principal is to connect our brands to consumers in that people empowered, agile and accountable with more resource collocated closer to the consumers they served. While we\u2019ve made progress, further changes will be made to accelerate improvement. We\u2019re reducing production cost and ensuring that ads we buy are reaching intended consumers at the appropriate time and place. We\u2019re driving media transparency to reduce waste and lower costs. We estimate we've eliminated significant media waste over the past year and we invested those savings to increase reach by 10% in trial program by about 50%. At the same time, we continue to reexamine our organization structure to identify new opportunities to improve productivity, reducing corporate, central staff in reinvesting in resources closer to consumers and customers. We\u2019re focused not just on cost productivity but also on cash. And an important cash productivity project has been supply chain financing which we continue to expand. This program which is a win for suppliers and P&G has yielded nearly $5 billion in cash in the five years we\u2019ve been driving it. Productivity improvement will be critical to fund investments for sales in market share growth while continuing to expand profit margins. Alongside the productivity work, we continue to evolve our organizational structure and culture to position us to whether the changing retail and competitive landscape. Clearly, we have learnt and we\u2019re acting on having more resources closer to consumers we serve with higher accountability, more agility and greater speed. Excuse me -- we\u2019re now nine months into the implementation of the end-to-end and freedom within a framework organizational model, simplifying the structure and clarifying responsibility and accountability. We're still in the early stages of the new design, learning, improving and reapplying success models as we go. Now to give you just the best evidence that I have that is making a difference is what we've done in greater China. We moved from minus 5% sales growth two years ago to plus 6% as clear to date, and I certainly recognize that we plan more changes will be made to ensure we're winning across the broader share of markets. We've talked to you several times about the changes for making in mastery, supplementing on internal talent with skilled, experience external hiring will strengthen our compensation and incentive programs. We've talked about how we are increasing the granularity of bonus programs, tying them much closer results individuals deliver, and based in part on shareholder input, the board's compensation and leadership development committee has modified the performance stock program to include relative sales growth metrics and a total shareholder return modifier to ensure awards reflect performance versus external competitive benchmarks. We also explore an additional opportunities to adjust incentive comp to drive greater accountability, including increase the amount of compensation at risk and more closely linking incentives to team and individual performance. And while the current environment presents several challenges we are making progress, we are delivering our financial objectives and we remain committed to improve results in baby and grooming while advancing our strategic priorities and continuing to drive productivity. Again, it is not business as usual and we are taking the additional steps to drive change. Our efforts to focus and strengthen our portfolio to extend our margin of competitive superiority to transform our supply chain to enhance our industry-leading margins and to simplify our organizational structure and increased accountability are all clearly aimed at delivering balanced top and bottom-line growth to create value over the short, mid and long-term. And with that, Jon and I would be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Steve Powers : Clearly, there are a number of near-term dynamics at play that I'm sure will be in focus throughout the call, pricing and the Merck acquisition probably front and center. But David, I wanted to take advantage of you being here and just step back for a minute, building on some of the comments you just made because when I think back to when you came as the CEO in late '15, you have a definite vision to return P&G to stable, profitable and market share positive growth at the risk of over oversimplify. I think calendar '16 was to be investment year, '17 a year of stabilization, and '18 a year of acceleration toward sustainability going forward. I mean even just six months to nine months ago, the plan was very publicly said to be working and we were supposed to be accelerating into the fiscal year end. So while I appreciate the incremental call to action today, it just feels that with the results today and the updated outlook, we're just a good ways away from that outcome? And I guess the question is 2.5 years in, how do you -- how does the board, how is the rest of the management team assess just the overall state of P&Gs turnaround? And from here, what's the definition of success and how long should investors expect to wait just to get there? So I think we all get the external challenges and we definitely appreciated the organization's efforts today, but at the same time we've been expecting more from the investments made these past two years. I'd just love your perspective. David Taylor : Just a couple of comments. One I would say, we had -- we have today a meaningful acceleration on eight of our businesses, and I feel good about those. Eight of our businesses are now growing over 3% and the profits are very strong. Core EPS on those selected that part of the business would be strong. We had two that have clearly been a bigger challenge than we anticipated that I anticipated. The steps that we are taking are showing signs, but it\u2019s taking longer. And that\u2019s going to require more change and more interventions, and we are taking those in each one of the brand country combinations in both baby and grooming to get them turned. What I\u2019ve seen though that I think reinforces that P&G is turning is just the breadth of brands, countries that are showing now strong growth, and it is showing up in share with the exception of in those two categories. I don\u2019t think investors should wait very long. I expect next year that we will turn. And I think right now the critical part is to ensure that Baby Care and Grooming execute their plans and the interventions that are planned and that we also continue to make and we will continue to make changes as needed as new market realities come forward. The last six months we\u2019ve seen improvements in many really important areas and as P&G getting in a very real way into the natural segment. P&G addresses some of the fastest growing segments. Now, it\u2019s in the first time in many years where we\u2019re starting to see majority of our top 20 markets turning. China is growing now in the mid singles as we said it would, Japan, strong growth in the mid to high singles. Majority of our top 15 to 20 markets are turning. So we do have some issues, we understand them and we are making additional interventions to address them. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : I wanted to ask a little bit about the ongoing inventory destocking and that\u2019s seemingly not just in the U.S. We're compings some big destocking, it was an issue last quarter as well. Clearly we keep track of what retailers are having to say. Those are wondering to what degree this is reflecting specific dynamics with some elements of your P&G specific portfolio, not just overall industry destock, whether it\u2019s like you mentioned -- you mentioned Harry's by name but Harry's getting distribution at Walmart, if there\u2019s some shelf base loss for Gillette. Retailers making efforts with private label, what happening with shelf space there? And maybe even in beauty where you\u2019ve got retailers like sourcing their own product in terms of disruptor and upstart brands and may be pressuring some legacy shelf space. So I just was curious about that as a dynamic more than just retailer trying to manage inventory for their own efficiency but it\u2019s really a statement around how the brands are performing and what takeaway is looking like? David Taylor : I\u2019ll give a comment and Jon, if you have any to jump in there. If I look just at the U.S., recently we\u2019ve turned to kind of right at flat and actually its plus 0.1. Your comments there were very fair. We have seen a couple of dynamics that I think you\u2019re hearing from us and probably some others, the pressure on retailer trade much is real. The pressure in increased emphasis on private label is very real. The dissolution of that is innovation that grows categories and that I think we\u2019re actually well positioned, but we have to do even more. And as we\u2019ve done it, we have certainly seeing progress. I don\u2019t believe that the end of just the modest inventory reductions is everybody works very hard to improve the supply chains, and we anticipate that and we're looking at that next year. We have seen more adjustments than planned this year as we commented on. The key to me though in each one of these categories is where we've demonstrated we can bring new ideas, not mentioned before the Fabric Care example where we come in with whether it\u2019s unstoppable so whether it's coming with just based laundry upgrades or new line extensions, we've been able to grow the category growth share, the challenge is in all these categories to do the same. After several years, we've seen Olay really start to take hold both in U.S. and China, but what's required was a rethinking of the communication model of our in-store presentation and in many cases new items that appeal to consumers. The most recent launch is doing extremely well. So, I believe category by category, you have to look at and while there is some inventory destocking, I believe the fundamental winning and losing will be determined by do you have a consumer proposition that is preferred and do you have a customer propositions that grows the category and helps create more margin. And there's a lot of pressure on that right now as the profit pool is being pressured because the dynamics that exist that you're well aware of both from discounters and from the e-commerce side and we'll have to deal with that. Jon Moeller : There is one other thing, Lauren, that we're actually well proactively contributing to this inventory reduction and that's the supply chain transformation that David talked about, and with our ability now to source, to have 80% of our sales source within 24 hours from production to shelf, there's less system inventory that's required and that's a good thing over periods of time. So, there is that element of contributing as well. And that's certainly U.S. dynamic but increasingly a dynamic in other parts of the world, as we transform the supply chain to better serve our customer base. Operator : Next, we'll go to Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : So David, your comment in the release about the ecosystems in which you operate being disrupted and transformed, and some of commentary on the call and your presence all seems to be highlighting a change in tone. And I guess my question to you would be, do you think there's been a material change in the profit growth outlook for the categories that P&G competes in, in the U.S. and globally versus what you would have expected a couple years ago? I mean you're pointing to some problems in baby and grooming, but you had negative pricing in every single division this quarter that's despite a commodity spike. That's not the way branded CPG companies are supposed to operate, you know organic sales is weakening despite a lot of that great internal work you've done to strengthen the organization over the last few years. And what I'd argue is that theoretically great macro environment for the U.S. consumer in what's a key geography for you? So I just want to understand would you agree there has been a change in the sort of profit growth algorithm for the industry or the categories you're in? And then, how does that affect your expectations for P&G's longer term EPS growth? B, willingness to invest behind the business? And C, the capital allocation decisions in terms of if M&A and diversification plays a greater role going forward? I know I'm cheating and asking multiple questions, but I think they're all related and important for your shareholders, so thank you. David Taylor : You did ask many big questions, I'll give comments. Jon will comment and we'll see, if we can some of this. What is clear is what it takes to win has gotten more difficult, do I believe that the profit availability has changed dramatically? No, and then look at some of our probably highest margin and part of the business to invest, but there is SK-II in West Coast where our total beauty business is making very good progress. Our Fabric Care business globally and in the U.S. is making very good progress. And I think what it takes it's got more difficult and then I mean that should actually favor overtime companies that have tremendous technology and can differentiate through a dimensioned superiority that matters to consumers on the five elements. But I\u2019ve got my eyes wide open that it\u2019s going to take additional funding to make that happen and that\u2019s why we do have to change faster. I am on the call because; one, I think the healthcare change is a meaningful positive step; and secondly, I want to be very clear it is not business as usual P&G. But it's not because anyway does it take away from the future it actually just reinforce how we\u2019ve made the choice that we\u2019re going to make additional changes to accelerate and get back on positive share growth, top line growth and bottom line growth. There are many things that are working very well on the Company a few are not in those, we\u2019re not going to work that kind of that we\u2019re growing through some tough challenges right now. But the fundamental strategy owing through some tough challenges right now with the fundamental strategy and the profit potential, I think are very much still there, just requires faster moves and we\u2019re one of the common on this and just illustrates. We have many questions a year ago on China because we come off a very difficult time and there we did have to move in a different way than the past a number of capabilities directly in the market and what we see there is almost instant reaction from the minus five to plus one to the plus six. In the U.S., we\u2019ve got many categories also turning. You have a dynamic in Baby Care that is very difficult and we\u2019re addressing it. We haven\u2019t had a dynamic a year ago and Shape Care and we\u2019re addressing that and you will start to see the last one to three months meaningful improvements. If you got consumers coming in and you\u2019ve got innovation that is the write down, we\u2019ve seen consumers are willing to pay interestingly the fastest growing segment is around most parts of the world are premium, super premium, new forms and naturals. All of those till that carry very good profit margins and very good growth rates. We do have to continue to transform our portfolio to increase the percent of our business in those forms and one example that\u2019s playing out across the world is pants and diapers, even though it\u2019s been a difficult category I am very pleased that we\u2019re leading a fastest growing segment the consumers around the world are choosing for their babies. Jon Moeller : I think the only thing I would add to that, Dara, is our two points. David made a point in his prepared remarks, so I think is very important the talks to the benefits of noticeable superiority, packaging products and communication of the market et cetera, and where we have that right. We\u2019re delivering our business objectives all the way from household penetration to market share to profit growth the vast majority of the time. And where we don\u2019t have that right is very clear we\u2019re not delivering against those objectives. So that\u2019s not a macro dynamic and that scenario that\u2019s holding us back, its increasing the level of advantage that we need to with our current portfolio which as David said we\u2019re going to use productivity to help fund. The other perspective I give you and this is not in any way an excuse, its perspective on whether it\u2019s a systemic issue here on not in any way an excuse its perspective on whether there is a systemic issue here or not from a market level standpoint to the point of the your question. If you look at as David mentioned this earlier as well. If you look at sales growth, excluding baby and drilling where we know we have work to do we\u2019re 3% fiscal year-to-date, profit growth 9% fiscal year-to-date. So, there is nothing as we look at the totality of the portfolio that indicates to us that those kind of results aren't available on a broader basis. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Nik Modi : So, I guess the question and maybe Jon you can answer this on category growth. How that's looking relative to where we were the last time you have the call three months ago? And if there's any way you can give us context between volume and pricing because it looks like pricing has broadly been deteriorating across the entire industry? And just related to that, I know you've talked a lot about the competition and it seems like the immerging markets, the local players are becoming much more sophisticated and much more of a nuisance for you guys and other multinational companies. So just wanted to understand either changing anyway you're making decisions to help compete against those local companies a bit more effectively? David Taylor : So let me comment on the market growth dynamics and will have David, comment on how were responding to evolving competitive realities. Market growth in the last quarter was essentially unchanged in aggregate from when we last talked last quarter. It's about 2.5% in our categories that's comprised of mid-singles and developing markets and low singles in developed markets. So, that's the status on market growth, of pricing, as I talked briefly about in my prepared remarks has also essentially unchanged versus when we last talked that is 30 basis points of additional price. But I don't think and clearly I mean I guess the retail dynamics that are recurring there is pressure on price, but where we can bring meaningful benefits superiority to market, we're seeing the ability to price. Pods or a premium priced item, these are premium priced. The Naturals elements items that we're bringing to market are premium price. So to the innovator, there continues to be a pricing opportunity. Jon Moeller : And let me point a little bit on the emerging markets, we are always trying because this is the biggest one that have the most comprehensive data on that, and I would just spend some time going through that markets carefully with the team. We have and if I look at to kind of where we are losing share we will gain share, you're absolutely right the greatest share losses and difficult periods have been kind of all other companies are local and regional competitors. But even that I have seen change over the last, if I go back two years ago the year ago to more recently, and it takes almost category-by-category FemCare definitely was being hit by Hang On which is a local competitor and some other local competitors. We were indexing from four years between 94 and 95 index, in fiscal '16, '17, we grew modestly to 105. We're right now tracking this fiscal year above the 115. Why? We put the pure cotton product out there. We've got the right -- it's the whole lineup is right now and the team has just done a beautiful job one by one understanding the consumer we had to re-staff in a way we are in addition to a strong team adding the capability to make decisions on the ground and that included another more fully functional capability there and we assign people from this center to the market. The same thing happened in Olay which were for many years, if go back to '14 to '15 and '15 to '16 with index in the 90s. This year's can be above 110, and it's showing it can accelerate now what's happened is that it had new some things additional to what we're doing in the rest of the market because you are right, local and regional competitors are doing a lot of stuff in the market. I will draw a distinction between where they may be some share gains and where people are creating value and sustaining that. We are showing, again, whether it\u2019s FemCare, Oral Care or Personal Care business, one by one getting better and which is why in aggregate is 6 and actually Mainland China is a little better than that. That's our Greater China unit. Mainland China is 1 point above that, as we can win against a very aggressive set of competitors. What\u2019s different is the innovation cycle is much shorter. The speed of decisions has to be faster and we\u2019ve had to reorganize to make that happen. That\u2019s part of the end-to-end but go much more aggressively in China. India, which is another market, is very, very difficult. And you see the India market where the whole world went through the too big transitions last year, we\u2019re now double-digit this year doing the same thing, making sure we have the right go-to-market capability for that specific market and then making sure we\u2019ve got superior consumer preferred both products. And one of the biggest changes is getting more latitude to the market to adjust the communication to meet and communicate with the local consumer. So actually I do believe that has been but I\u2019ve got a lot of evidence we can win in China and India, the two biggest markets who are now starting to grow and growing at an accelerating pace as we go through the fiscal year. Jon Moeller : And I think as well just reflecting on China for a second to your question, Nik about price potential on a global basis. I mean that\u2019s a market we\u2019re at a market level. The premium and super premium tiers are more than 100% of the growth of the market, which continues to be very attractive in total. And our business as well in that market David mentioned Feminine Care is growing fastest at the premium portion of the market. So as we look globally, there continues to be significant opportunities for growth from a sales standpoint and doing that very profitably. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citi. Wendy Nicholson : Hi, I had a couple of questions but they are short and discrete, probably that\u2019s okay. First of all, the private label growth in the diaper market in U.S., are you seeing that more in-store or is that an Amazon phenomenon? Number two, is the fact that you\u2019re buying the Merck business, does that mean or imply or suggest that you won\u2019t be buying a big piece of the Pfizer business? And then third question is just on the guidance for pricing to remain negative and aggregate for the next several quarters but the gross margin is supposed to be up in the fourth quarter if I heard that right. Does it seem strange to me not only given the negative pricing but all the commodity inflation we\u2019re seeing. So can you explain from a productivity initiative perspective like what\u2019s the light switch that goes on in the fourth quarter that\u2019s going to get gross margins up? David Taylor : On private label? Jon Moeller : Yes, private label what we are seeing is an acceleration of support, I am seeing more but actually in-store in some of our retailers and I think in part due to defending versus the lead on holiday launches that have continued to expand. And because of the importance of that consumer, both all the retailers recognized getting the young mom is important for the basket. And because the profitability pressure, there is a lot of movement there. What we have to do in our doing is making sure our products preferred and that\u2019s the way best to win versus private label and we\u2019ve demonstrated that in Europe over a decade and we\u2019re going to have to sharpen and speed up in terms of some of the changes that we are making to make sure we win with the U.S. consumer. But it is I think a reaction to two dynamics both online and the discounter moves that occurred in the last year, but baby diapers specifically it\u2019s disproportionate off-line versus online. So Amazon, for example, is not a huge dynamic in that category other than as David said it's influencing the behavior of other retailers. In terms of your question on pricing and commodity inflation and productivity and gross margin, pricing will remain a negative impact to top line for the next quarter that's as far as we guided at this point other than I do expect it to turn positive sometime next year. The amount of the impact should lessen over time and one of the big drivers Wendy is simply that we annualize the big Gillette U.S. pricing reduction starting now. Also productivity as we've talked about tends to be back-loaded so increases as the year progresses and bring on additional savings, David mentioned for example the start of production in West Virginia and so I feel reasonably confident that we can grow gross margins in the face of a continued price impact on the top line albeit at lower levels. Sorry, you also asked, this is the trouble with multipart questions is I forget. You also asked about acquisitions and as you will readily appreciate positively or negatively that's not a topic we comment on. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English : I've got some few potential questions on the table, but I want to come back to the pricing one. The narrative of premium tiers driving growth isn't really new nor is the narrative of you upgrading your portfolio and intervening into those premium tiers? And yet, it clearly results your price mix is eroding and if you look at Nielsen down the U.S., you sold more promotion the U.S. last quarter than any time last five years. And obviously costs, your European competitors facing FX historically this has been fairly counter your pricing. So from the outside looking in, it seems like you're chasing a price value equation lower in the wake of all this disruption that you're talking about on the retail side, the competitive front as well, none of that disruption looks like it's poised to abate anytime soon. So why should we expect price to improve going forward? Why shouldn't we be assuming that this is sort of a new reality and maybe looking to address the business model the cost structure more aggressively to adapt to this new reality? David Taylor : I'd say there is some element of new reality there, Jason. I think that's a very valid point. And as David said, this is not business as usual, so were changing everything to adapt to that new reality, whether it's entering segments that are new segments that also carry premium prices that are going fast like the natural segment. We talked about ever-increasing levels of productivity to be able to allow us to continue to invest while holding and building margins $200 million to $300 million ahead of our going in target this year and I expect we will have a very aggressive plan next year as well. So we want to be prepared to win in a scenario where this is a continuing dynamic, but again in many parts of the world it\u2019s a very different market reality and in those markets we need to position ourselves to win with those consumers. Jason English : The only thing reinforced and maybe I haven\u2019t, it is clearly communicated as I want to, we do recognize changes must be made and the cost structure demands are real into more than the past period. That\u2019s real and what we had anticipated is not sufficient therefore we need to do more. I do believe that the strategy is right. What is going to take to bring it to life and deliver the outcome we want, means we\u2019re going to have to do more things differently than we\u2019ve done before and we look at some choices we\u2019ve made to make sure that we\u2019re making immediate progress over the timeframe we\u2019re talking and to me right now that is going on in the Company and will continue to go the Company because there is a reality that you\u2019d got whether it's in the discount or is the e-commerce and retailers are working hard to make sure they get their share of the value created in an industry and the winners is going to the ones that have products consumers. Weren\u2019t more than anything and once they can help grow margins and to do that we\u2019re going to have to have more investment available and that\u2019s got to come through our cost structure? David Taylor : And this also isn\u2019t a dynamic that\u2019s new. We\u2019ve talked before about for example what happens when the discounter expanded in Europe and private label shares grew significantly as a percentage of the market in Europe over the last 20 years and our business has went through peace in valleys and it wasn\u2019t an easy adjustment but we made the adjustments we needed to make and our business has performed very well in that context building share and the vast majority of our big brands and categories in Europe over that period of time. That\u2019s no guarantee for success with the current dynamic in the U.S. We certainly don\u2019t approach it that way but it's also a reason to believe that it can be done. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Olivia Tong : David, you went through a number of initiatives around baby, grooming and a few other categories. Most of the moves they're seemed to be around pricing and promotion, less around products. So as a market leader in the majority of your categories, why do you think that these are the right moves? And why do you believe they\u2019re not potentially contributing to taking even more dollars out of these categories? And if I could just follow up on earlier question on margins, lot of pressure right now on gross margin obviously and those pressures seem to be growing maybe pricing less than July action slab but you\u2019ve got negative mix, the freight issue et cetera that you\u2019re dealing with. Do you think that there is enough productivity benefits next year to offset these to get gross margin expansion as we look at the fiscal \u201919? David Taylor : Well first, we will make pricing adjustments where we\u2019re lost consumer value but that is not how we lead, that\u2019s not our lead strategy. Our strategy is to drive consumer and actually trade consumers up and then in Baby Care the fastest growing segments are pants and premium trait. What we have to do and are doing is innovating on those platforms what has taken more time then I would want is to get a platforms in place in the cost optimize as we get winning products out. In pants, the product is winning and we\u2019re growing share in the categories growing fast. We\u2019ve got a large inst all business on mainline across many countries and that segment is under tremendous pressure and you are right, that part of the business is very price sensitive. And as we get more and more of our portfolio in the premium and super premium segments, we actually insulate ourselves from some of the issues that you\u2019re talking. The same is true on Gillette as we continue to trade people up than we have stronger profitability where we were missing and what required this intervention was we were losing too many users and over the long-term that is a real problem and so we had to strengthen our innovation on all three tiers, disposables the mid-tier systems which is marked and the premium systems which is the fusion. Family, each of those have innovations in the past we only invented at the high end the risk in that as you lose users and losing users overtime was the issue that lead to the intervention that on, but on categories our pricing interventions are meant to be very competitive our strategy to win is on premium super premium superior products. Jon Moeller : And on your question on margins, we're just in the beginning phases of putting our plans together for next year, Olivia, so I don't want to provide specific guidance, but our objective clearly will be to continue our margin growth on both the gross and operating margin line and we will be just as we did this year looking to increase the level of productivity savings that we can bring to bear in that situation, and I expect as well if the commodity trends continue that there will be pricing in some categories and some markets to help offset this as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj : So because there are two for topics M&A and obviously kind of your core business, maybe I'll indulge with the two questions. One is on the M&A, why is this the right time to do the Merck OTC deal in both Merck KG OTC deal? So many other thing is going on it was not a cheap valuation as some would argue, it doesn't really move the needle. Was it really that the kind of Teva either pulling out or you guys are excited that JV doesn\u2019t work is that really kind of precipitate this is the first question? And then the second question, building on some the things we've been talking about. I guess I'm wondering what plan B and you may say it's too early to talk about that, but look less as there is little bit drama but acquisition for sure and it comes up to be more smaller compelling pack of change if any guy do a really good job your market organization in terms of talking about change but why not if we can make much films about it and the actual numbers aren't good, right. You're pricing guides were down 2% and this is after a quarters and quarters and quarters the accommodation and no price wars when we heard children that this question we really just ask this question. And by the way it only becomes positive it sounds like sometime in that fiscal year and towards the pricing but that doesn\u2019t feel good. You said look we are 8 out of 10 are good, and two of them are not good into your categories but there is always through they are not good right. I mean it just seems like there is always something at P&G as some calorie combinations are doing well which impacts the whole business it hasn\u2019t come together we get that but I guess why will it now continues to be the question we ask and if you look at as that business is neutral but we have heard some form and that business is real for at least five years. So I guess what if the strategy doesn\u2019t work, what if the world is actually two dramatically different HPC you start look like packaged foods for investors perspective what is Plan B. One of the things you guys think about as a record option as I just don\u2019t innovate is it shakes your headcounts by 80% not 25%. Are you just going to have excess and we're going to have expected all of your earning. I really want to get underneath this Plan B part as well please? David Taylor : So, let me take this last questions and commentary there. First on is this the right time. This was a very good transition that Teva and you\u2019re probably with the situation right now with Teva and our discussion with Teva, it was clear that the ongoing future of the JV needed change and that\u2019s been one of the strongest parts of the business. At the same time, Merck complements what we have and strengthens what is left once we separate from Teva. It gives us a better geographic footprint. It gives us some additional therapeutic areas. They are growing in the mid to high single-digits. When you put the two together, and this transition, it gives us a stronger business in a category that\u2019s got attractive margins and strong growth rate. It\u2019s a positive mix for the Company. If you looked on a go forward basis, and these things happen when they happen and those opportunity and I am very pleased we got this done. I think it\u2019s very positive for P&G shareholders in the future. And we don\u2019t pick the timing on when all these things happen, there\u2019s other parties involved. But when it does, you get it done, you get done it right. The second one is you have many, many questions and some comments and there just a comment on there\u2019s always some business certainly recognize that and to our history there\u2019s always been some businesses up and down. We have two particularly large businesses that have had particularly meaningful perks. The changes over the last couple of years show a level of breadth that indicates P&G can win across a wide range of markets and a wide range of categories. I completely accept that we must improve to aggregate P&G company top, bottom and share, cash performance has been very strong. And we are making the interventions to do that. Will we look at more significant interventions and how we\u2019re organized in taking cost out? We\u2019ve already addressed that. Yes, we will in ways to create the productivity savings in order to make the interventions needed. I don\u2019t think there is a broad HPC industry can\u2019t win or can\u2019t generate value, I don\u2019t buy that scenario. And I believe it\u2019s just incumbent upon the leaders in the categories to come up in the innovation that does create value. And there\u2019s periods you go through in a category they're difficult, and the winners are the ones that come out with fundamentals that are strong consumer preferred products. And it has to be done even more than in the past in a way where the retailer sees category growth and margin growth. And that requires again additional productivity to fund it. And what we are doing is adjusting and in some cases going to have to do a meaningful additional effort to make that happen. David Taylor : And just back to timing on Merck, we\u2019ve been trying to communicate this morning that we realized that we are operating in a world that is changing and we need to change with it. And we can\u2019t in that context ignore work or complexity that we take on in order to make those changes. And one of those changes has been and will continue to be increasingly attractiveness of the footprint of the portfolio. And OTC is a very attractive space for us. This opportunity became available. We embrace the change opportunity that it represented, both the sun-setting of the JV, which has been very successful and this new opportunity. And we\u2019ll continue across our activity system to take on necessary change to improve outcomes. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : David just sticking with the topic of M&A and of course I appreciate you won't comment on specific asset that was brought up earlier, but in light of this acquisition and many of the challenges that have been discussed does M&A play an increasing role in the capital allocation strategy to move into categories that are growing faster particularly than some that are challenging the existing portfolio. I was hoping you could touch on your M&A criteria maybe the appetite for potentially larger deals. Maybe that's not what the Company needs at this point I think there's some merit to that argument and then potential categories, geographies of interest and just the last part of that just given the significant amount of portfolio pruning which has happened over the past several years. Can you just confirm that the areas of interest are only within Proctor's existing ten that are in the portfolio at this point of time? David Taylor : What I would say you know there's so much I could say about future and about M&A, the core growth will come from organic sales and profit growth within our existing portfolio. We are open as demonstrated by the announcement today, where we see an opportunity create value, especially if it causes us to play in a category that is very attractive to demographics and the structural profitability and I'd just we stay very open. I think you also said, we're looking a lot outside our ten categories. The key is to stay focused on the 10 but look for ways and they're maybe some adjacencies that leverage core capabilities of the Company and for those I would be open as well. But again, it's not a C shift to say primarily driven by growth by inorganic approaches, no but a level of openness probably that's more in the past because we finished the portfolio pruning, and now we believe each category ought to be active managers in the portfolio. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Bonnie Herzog : I just have a quick question regarding you know macro indicators such as consumer confidence really are at or near highs but category growth still remains quite weak, so could you guys help reconcile this for us and better understand the disconnect between these factors. David Taylor : The category growth varies widely, it stayed strong in China it's picked up in India. The U.S. has been difficult and part of that is aggressive pricing action is taken place with some of the dynamics we talked before, between online and offline and a couple of big highly contested categories with Baby Care being the best example I can think of where many are after that consumer and have been willing to price pretty aggressively even different from what we may sell to them. And that kind of goes up and down. I do believe in most markets around the world we're seeing actually stable to anything slightly improving and that's because of the progress in India has been a big plus. A couple markets and Jon mentioned one earlier that has been a real challenge, markets like Saudi, it contracted a great deal and that's by a choice by the government to focus on the Saudization and the diversification of the economy and we've seen that hit both Saudi and it's had the impact on the Gulf states. And there's always been volatility in Africa, but if a look at Europe, stable, if anything slightly improving. The U.S. in terms of volume is stable and in some categories improving. Pricing is difficult right now. And Brazil, the outlook by most would be improving in the future, difficult the last few years coming out of two years of a severe recession. Mexico is stable and pretty solid. And who knows, I think Russia is impacted pretty heavily by some external events that are going on right now. But I don\u2019t see a weakening of the global consumer demand, if anything probably just sequentially a modest improvement outside of the U.S. and stably in U.S. Operator : Next we will go to Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Unidentified Analyst : This is actually Grant on for Bill. We just had a question on the Grooming segment and kind of the entrants of that value-tiered player into large U.S. retailer. Here\u2019s our question is more on to that player entered into another U.S. retailer this past year. And I was wondering what impact of that was on your business then, maybe if there\u2019s any additional pricing pressure forward -- going forward due to that entrant in that retailer? David Taylor : The entrant that is going through a novel and is right, already present, when they first came was coincident or actually right before, we took the pricing action. And the issue was we were not serving consumers in the below $10 price range. We didn\u2019t have what we needed at the $799 to $999 price point, so then came into one of the large U.S. retailers and it did have an impact. Post the intervention we\u2019ve made as we said our volume has picked up. Though we enter this next phase, while it still will be a challenge, we have the portfolio now where we have key price points covered. We have got innovation going in across disposables to mid tiers to bring in systems and we are in a much better place to compete. And we are also taking aggressive defensive actions to make sure that we communicate with our consumers. In fact the volume is improving is a positive sign. The fact that even the past one in three month value shares have improved is positive. We will have another challenge when they first enter and -- but we\u2019re in a very different competitive place in grooming and our eyes are wide open this time to make sure we defend our business aggressively. The same is true on some of the online entrants in Europe. This time we are going to defend our business and work to keep our consumers and certainly attract consumers that are interested in online experiences. We recognize that competitive environment will continue to be challenging, all that just means acceleration, make changes that are needed and if what you\u2019re doing doesn\u2019t work, be open to new ideas and we are. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge. Jonathan Feeney : David, you mentioned the user base in grooming a couple of times and I\u2019ve to come to you in the Q&A, the need to hold on to these users. I mean what if it's a case that fragmentation is just natural here and kind of users who want a more low end experience just are your -- aren't great 20-year Gillette and that there\u2019s going to be a next wave of innovation that takes care of this and what you need is higher prices and higher value and to pull consumers up. I mean I know that sounds like pie in the sky at this pint with all these entrants. But I also observe that doing this for 17 years in food, beverage, HPC, I can\u2019t think of a time when absolutely dominant and global leader with a price premium has kind of heal by category by taking price and profit out of it. But that's scared that's basically restored order and by the way what's happening. What is if that makes you walk the user base to be higher at the expense of profit? And what data do you see that makes you think that's the right answer? David Taylor : I think there is a good set of data if you in Gillette specifically, if the consumers enter Gillette, I'll call it that their portfolio ladder has been lot of evidenced that they experience better and what they were using before at whatever price here and then we can expose them to the next level up in performance and consumers move up. And so what was problematic was if you're losing too many new consumers, certainly a time where there is some societal trends around the frequency of shaving. You put those two together and said we're not going to sit by and watch the significant portion of new users, more millennial consumers not been exposed to Gillette and get on habits that one don\u2019t given the best consumer experience and secondly would compromise the brand. So their maybe interventions it did bring the volume back and again we've got a lot of evidenced overtime and you think about almost any category you get in, if you are pleased with the performance of the product when you enter you opening to ideas from that ideas and products from that brand. It is to be a losing strategy to have a smaller and smaller group of consumers playing more and more and believe that will continue and grow your business at acceptable rate. And that's why we want to play in the premium and super premium, but we also have an appropriate entry in most of our categories to bring consumers in and then given the delightful experiences that they are happy to pay more. And that's true and than in the 8 of the 10 categories working. It's also why we start early in with pampers with great products, but we also have Loves or mid-tier as we want to be present to bring consumers in, but then once they are into anyone of our brand franchises have a meaningfully better experience, and give them the choice as the world is trading up and we have a lot of average overtime, a lot of categories that they will, but you have to be price competitive at the point the consumer invest in the category. Operator : And now your final question comes from the line of Joe Altobello with Raymond James. Joe Altobello : Just want to go back to the shift in emphasis to private label on the part of retailers in certain categories I actually get the fact that you see better margins for them, but it's always been brands that really drive traffic. Is that a commentary on the impact on this of innovation by branded players like yourself in certain categories? Or does the consumer simply value product performance differently today than they did three or five years ago? David Taylor : I don\u2019t think there is a fundamental difference in the consumers valuing from seeing private-label different and I think private label has improve their quality, and I think we have to maintain the level of advantage and justify as the price premium and it is simple as that. When we do that and do that well and we got all kinds of examples. We're able to earn the consumer's trust and the additional cost is actually a good value for them. I expect the private-label manufacturers will continue to and what they generally do is look what the large manufactures are doing or the branded players and they will add new features and we need to be innovative in bringing new ideas and meaningfully better performance. It is so fundamental to why the strategy of meaningful superiority has to be implemented. In the categories where we've done that we're seeing just what you want to see and we want to see. The top line growth that grow share, bottom line growth that creates value in higher single digits, we've got a few where that isn't the case and if you have a very long and that has weighted down the Company, but when achieved the strategy works. The challenge is to achieve it more consistently, in more brands, across more countries. And while we have those, we have a few big rocks still to move and we've been very open about what those are and we're willing to take additional actions and we will take additional actions to make sure we have the funding and the capability to make that happen. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

LLC Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC Operator : Good morning, and welcome to Procter & Gamble's quarter-end conference call. P&G would like to remind you that today's discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections. Additionally, the company has posted on its Investor Relations website, www.pginvestor.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP and other financial measures. Now I will turn the call over to P&G's Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: - joining me this morning. I'm going to provide an update on company results. David will update us on key strategy and focus areas. We'll close with guidance and then turn to your questions. We continue to make important progress : strong volume and consumption growth, earnings per share at or above target, cash above target, market share is improving. Progress, though room for improvement on all metrics, most notably the top line. Organic volume grew 2% for the year, 3% in Q4. Organic sales growth fell just shy of rounding up to 2%. Eight of 10 global categories grew organic sales. In aggregate, these categories grew at over a 3% pace. Online sales grew 30% for the year to nearly $4.5 billion in sales, approaching 7% of our total business, roughly the size of the next two largest consumer e-commerce businesses combined. We added nearly $1.2 billion of e-commerce sales in fiscal 2018 after adding about $1 billion in sales in fiscal 2017. All-channel consumption grew at a faster rate than sales, between 2% and 3%. As a result, our share positions improved. Fiscal 2018 market share trends improved in eight of the 15 largest countries versus the prior year, with fourth quarter trends better than fiscal year average in 10 of 15. Market share trends advanced in seven of 10 global product categories, with improvement as the year progressed. We held or built e-commerce value share in eight of 10 product categories. We made good progress in our two largest markets. U.S. all-outlet value share improved from a 30 basis point decline in fiscal 2017 to flat for fiscal 2018 to 30 basis points share growth in April-June. Seven of 10 product categories grew all-outlet value share in Q4. Seven of 10 categories improved their share trends on a past-six-months versus 12-month basis, and on a past-three-month versus six-month basis. All-outlet unit consumption grew 2.5% for the full year in the U.S. and was up more than 3% in the fourth quarter. We continued the strong turnaround in China, improving from a 5% sales decline in fiscal 2016 to 1% growth in 2017 to 7% organic sales growth last year. Sales growth accelerated as the year progressed, growing 6% in the first half and 8% in the second half, including 10% organic sales growth in Q4. Six of seven categories are holding or growing sales, up from one of seven categories two years ago. We generated about $1.6 billion in e-commerce sales, nearly 30% of the China business. Our global top line was challenged by several unexpected disruptions. In Brazil the worst transportation strike in more than 20 years, virtually shutting down shipments for two weeks; Saudi Arabia and the Gulf markets contracted significantly due to sharp increases in utility and gas prices, higher taxes, and an exodus of foreign workers; renewed trade restrictions with Iran; Algerian bans on imported products; severe consumption contraction in Egypt and Nigeria due to high inflation; and decreasing affordability following more than 100% currency devaluation. Organic sales in these markets declined 13%, off a $2.2 billion base, a 40 basis points drag on companywide organic sales growth. Global retail inventory reductions took an additional 30 to 40 basis points out of sales as customers managed cash and purchases shifted to e-commerce. As you know, we've been pointing to challenges in two categories : Grooming and Baby Care. While there's still more work to do, we've made significant progress on both. Global Shave Care share was in line with prior year, with Braun share up 0.5 point. We improved U.S. male blades and razors value share from a 4-point decline in fiscal 2017 to nearly flat for fiscal 2018, to over a 1-point increase in the fourth quarter. We launched Gillette 3 and Gillette 5 razors in the U.S. last quarter to strengthen our position at opening price points for male shaving systems. We've revamped and strengthened our online program, Gillette On Demand, increasing the rate of new user recruitment and retention. We're currently growing volume share and value share on a past three- and six-month basis. U.S. Male Shave Care delivered 3% volume growth last fiscal year with male shaving systems up 5%. Venus all-outlet share of female blades and razors in the U.S. grew 0.5 point last year and 1.5 points in the fourth quarter. We face new challenges on Gillette, as a value-share competitor is expanding in-store distribution in the U.S., and its competitors are expanding their direct-to-consumer propositions in Europe. We're funding strong plans to protect the business, but competitive actions are likely to have at least some impact. Baby Care had a challenging year, but we significantly strengthened our long-term position. China sales and share trends improved sequentially through the year. In the fourth quarter, the business grew organic sales mid-single digits, and share progress accelerated, returning Pampers to overall share leadership in Mainland China. Pampers more than doubled its share of premium-tier diapers last year, extended its share lead on pants, and took value share leadership in e-commerce. Baby Care sales in India, an important growth market for the future, grew 34%. U.S. Baby Care was challenged by aggressive private-label pricing that primarily impacted the Luvs brand, retail inventory adjustments, smaller retail-funded promotions, and a comparison against a base period that included the successful relaunch of Pampers Easy Ups Training Pants. We've strengthened our consumer value proposition on Luvs, with value share starting to stabilize. We introduced Pampers Pure Protection, diapers and Aqua Pure Wipes in April. In just a few weeks, we achieved share leadership in the naturals segment and tracked channels. Consumer reviews of Pampers Pure have been very strong, and we expect momentum to grow as we drive awareness and trial. We continue to build on the success of our diaper pant products. Pampers is the global share leader in pant-style diapers, with nearly a 30% share of a form growing at a double-digit rate, positioning us well as the market continues to shift towards pants. New premium-tier innovation and new pack sizes are launching this quarter that include a price increase on most items, equivalent to a 4% increase across the North America Pampers diaper business. Challenges remain on both Grooming and Baby Care and competition's strong, but we're much better positioned as we enter fiscal 2019 than we were heading into 2018. Moving to the bottom line, our going-in fiscal year guidance called for core earnings per share growth of 5% to 7%. Despite significant cost challenges nearly double what we expected at the start of the year, increased transportation costs, and increased investments in consumer and customer value, core earnings per share was $4.22 for the fiscal year, up 8% above the high end of the going-in guidance range and at the high end of our mid-year revised range. Commodities and transportation costs were a $500 million after-tax headwind, a 5-point drag on core earnings per share growth. Foreign exchange was a modest earnings help for the year. Tax reform was around a $150 million benefit. Core operating margin contracted 50 basis points as pricing lagged commodity cost increases. We've grown core operating margin 270 basis points over the preceding four fiscal years, 610 points excluding foreign exchange, and expect to resume margin growth as pricing is implemented to offset commodity costs and as more productivity savings come online. Productivity improvements generated 260 basis points of savings for the year that we just completed. Our current 21.6% core operating profit margin is among the highest in the industry, and we continue to hold advantages in below-the-line costs. We borrow at some of the most favorable rates in the industry. We have a tax rate that is among the industry's lowest. All of this leaves us with a core after-tax profit margin of nearly 17%, one of the highest after-tax margins in the industry, with three years of the current productivity program still ahead of us. Cash flow remains dependably strong, with adjusted free cash flow productivity of 104%, well above our going-in target of 90%. We raised the dividend 4%, growing it for the 62nd consecutive year. We paid out more than $7 billion in dividends and repurchased $7 billion of stock, returning more than $14 billion in value to shareowners. Over the last 10 years, we've returned more than $120 billion in dividends and share repurchase, greater than 100% of adjusted net earnings. Our current dividend yield of 3.6% is nearly a full point higher than the Consumer Staples SPDR Fund average. Detailed fourth quarter results are provided in our press release, so I'll just hit a few of the highlights. Organic volume up 3%. Organic sales were up over 1%. Core earnings per share were $0.94, up 11% for the quarter. All-in earnings per share was $0.72, including $0.14 per share of non-core restructuring charges and $0.09 per share of early debt retirement costs. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 158%. In summary, core earnings per share growth above the going-in guidance range and at the high end of the revised range despite significant commodity and transportation cost increases; cash ahead of target; strong consumption with improving share trends; sales growing but modestly below our target range; progress in many areas, but again importantly room to improve on all metrics, particularly organic sales growth. David? David S. Taylor - Procter & Gamble Co.: I'd like to add some perspective on our results, especially the top line sales and share growth, as sales growth was softer than we want but share is showing why I am confident the interventions are working and moving us forward in a sustainable way. We have more brands, categories, and countries growing than we did last year or the year before. The trends over time are very clear. Importantly, the improvements are driven by the strategic interventions and plans, starting with interventions to improve the superiority of our products, packages, communications, go-to-market, and value, both consumer and customer. I'd like to provide some highlights on the progress on brands and markets, and then go into more detail on the actions and the impact of our choices. First some quick highlights. As Jon, said eight of 10 product categories in 18 of our top 25 brands held or grew organic sales in fiscal 2018. SK-II grew more than 30%. Downy grew sales double digits, driving mid-single digit growth on the fabric enhancer category and over a point of value share growth over the past three, six, and 12 months. Eight brands grew organic sales mid to high single digits, including Ariel, Always, Olay, Oral-B, Old Spice, Braun, Febreze, and Swiffer. Twelve of our top 15 countries held or grew organic sales in fiscal 2018, with six of those growing mid-single digits or faster. Turkey and India each delivered strong double-digit growth, with all categories in each country growing sales. Japan grew mid-single digits, with value share up over 0.5 point for the year and up more than a point the past six and three months. Mexico grew organic sales in mid-single digits. Twenty-six of our largest category-country combinations held or grew market share, up from 21 of 50 last year. As Jon has said, we have more work to do to accelerate results. We clearly are operating in a very dynamic environment. Changing government policies including tax, trade, and privacy; retail transformation; disruption of the media ecosystem; rising input and transportation costs; and foreign exchange headwinds; with highly capable multinational and local competitors determined to win. We are accelerating changes to meet these challenges and further improve results. This will enable us to spot and capitalize on opportunities, and identify and fix issues faster than we ever had in the past. We will be the disruptors in our industry. We're investing to improve superiority, our margin of advantage. We're making P&G ever more productive. We are structuring an organization and building a culture that continues to put us in front of change, riding the wave of this dynamic environment versus being hit by it. We're leading disruption across the value chain, innovation, supply systems, consumer communication, retail execution, customer and consumer value, to consistently and sustainably grow sales, margins, and cash. And next I'd like to offer a few points on superiority, which is really our basis to win. We've made a deliberate choice to invest in the superiority of our products and packages, retail execution, marketing, and value, and not just in the premium tier, but in each price tier where we compete. We need to strengthen the long-term health and competitiveness of our brands. To do this, we've raised our standards for each of these superiority drivers. In brand-country combinations where we judge ourself to be noticeably superior in at least four of the five elements, we deliver meaningful improvement in key business success measures, including household penetration, which is the number of people that buy our brands each year; market growth, critical to us and our retailers; value share growth; sales growth; and profit \u2013 all 80% of the time. When we are superior in just three or fewer of the superiority elements, we grow all of the business success measures 0% of the time. A few examples of where superiority is driving growth include our Fabric Care business, where in the U.S. we grew organic volumes 6% behind superior innovations like Tide PODS, Gain Flings, and fabric enhancer scent beads. These innovations have been the driving force of Fabric Care market growth. Unit-dose detergents and scent beads have driven Japan Fabric Care to a record organic sales growth of 9%. In Europe, Fabric Care organic sales grew 5% for the second consecutive year, driving category growth and delivering 27 consecutive months of share growth. Feminine Care has delivered 11 consecutive quarters of organic sales growth, with the combination of outstanding product innovations and packaging on Always pads and Always Discreet in adult incontinence. They've developed compelling marketing campaigns that are building brand equity and driving trial. They're growing the category, earning strong distribution and display of new items. They're driving trade-up to premium variants that consumers view as an excellent value for the product performance they receive. Turning to Skin Care, Olay and SK-II are serving different segments of the skin care markets, and both are delivering strong results by improving superiority. SK-II sales have grown for 15 consecutive quarters at an average rate of over 20%, including 30% last fiscal year. SK-II's superior product is based on a proprietary formula that works to dramatically rejuvenate the skin's appearance. It's a product that solves problems for consumers in a noticeable way. It's presented in prestige packaging that builds brand equity and consumer confidence in the product. SK-II's marketing campaign has accelerated growth of new users by connecting to them on a more emotional level while reinforcing product benefits. Excellent retail execution, in stores and online, leverage a rich consumer database in technology like our state-of-the-art skin analysis tool, which we call the Beauty Imaging System, to make a personal connection with consumers. The combination of these support SK-II's premium price and value for the consumer. Olay in China has delivered five consecutive quarters of double-digit organic sales growth behind superiority across all touch points. We launched Olay Cell Science last year, Olay's first-ever super peptide formula, delivering visible skin transformation in 28 days. We've upgraded Olay packaging to prestige-like quality and attractiveness. We've completely revamped our Olay beauty counselor program. We've reduced the number of beauty counters and upgraded the remaining counters with higher and tighter standards. Our \"Fearless of Age\" campaign, with an empowering message for consumers, has driven consumption and has contributed to strong e-commerce sales that are up 80% fiscal year to date and has grown Olay's market share. And we've talked about the work we're doing to respond to a changing world and changing consumer needs, including increased demand for natural and sustainable products. We've now introduced products in nearly every category that address these emerging consumer needs. Tide purclean, Gain Botanicals, Dreft purtouch, ZzzQuil PURE Zzzs, Febreze ONE, Whisper Pure Cotton, and more recently we just launched Pampers Pure Protection diapers and Aqua Pure Wipes. Our naturals segment offerings quadrupled sales in fiscal 2018. We expect to more than double sales again in 2019. We're in this game and in this important segment to win. We're augmenting organic innovations with acquisitions : Native, a natural deodorant, and Snowberry skin care, a naturals brand based in New Zealand. We recently announced our agreement to acquire First Aid Beauty, a full line of prestige-quality skin care products that deliver superior skin health solutions specifically designed for sensitive skin and skin conditions like redness, irritation, and eczema. We are leveraging lean innovation practices to create and extend product and packaging superiority faster and more cost-effectively than ever before. And Pampers Pure is a good example. It reached the market in half the time of a typical product innovation in a very capital-intensive diaper category. We're using the lean approach to explore how we can solve new problems for consumers, addressing new jobs to be done. We have several new products in various stages of market testing right now and we've brought them to that point at a fraction of the time and investment it would have taken us without this lean approach. We're making a big move to more deliberately consider and pursue external monetization of P&G innovation in noncompeting industries. And occasionally where we think the benefit of sharing the innovation will enhance value creation and the societal benefit can be meaningful, we may make the technology available within our competitive set. I'll give you an example : Air Assist packaging that we invented for e-commerce shipping of liquids that delivers significantly better visual impression and end use experience, and it reduces plastic usage by 50%. We just started licensing this technology broadly. We're doing the same with other P&G innovations that provide significant sustainability benefits. We invented a breakthrough technology to revolutionize the plastic recycling industry. It separates color, odor, and other contaminants from recycled polypropylene plastic to purify it into a nearly new-quality resin. By allowing others to utilize and commercialize this technology, we'll lower the cost, unlock value, and improve environmental sustainability of entire industries. In addition to products and packages, we're improving the superiority of consumer communication and retail execution, as well as consumer and customer value. At this year's Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, P&G and our agencies won 26 Lions for the outstanding work on P&G brand campaigns, including two of the Grand Prix honors for the \"It's a Tide Ad\" campaign, which launched during the Super Bowl, and \"The Talk,\" which started an important conversation about racial bias. We used the forum to announce further commitments to advancing diversity and gender equality in our advertising. Now, an external measure of our improved retail execution is the global Advantage Monitor Report, an independent retailer assessment of manufacturers across seven key focus areas. Our objective is to be ranked number one overall and the top third versus competition in all areas. For the third straight year, we were number one ranked globally, with the highest number of countries ranking P&G as the number one manufacturer. We also ranked number one in all seven practice areas for the second year in a row, with noticeable improvements in the categories of Business Relationship and Support, importantly Category Development, Supply Chain, and Customer Service. We've done this by improving our capability to take faster action with customers and align our people with the categories they sell. We've increased investments to improve retail execution, distribution assortment and display, and consumer and customer value, all important elements of our superiority strategy. We're making good progress on extending our margin of advantage and increasing the quality of execution, but we face highly capable competitors who continue to innovate their products and business models. Addressing these challenges and extending our product and package advantages, superior execution, and consumer and customer value will require continued investment. The need for this investment and the need to drive balanced top and bottom line growth, including margin expansion, underscores the importance of productivity. We are driving cost savings and efficiency improvement in all facets of our business, approaching the midpoint of our second five-year, $10 billion productivity program. We've consistently delivered $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion in annual cost of goods sold savings. I expect we'll be at the high end of the range again this fiscal year. Another area of savings is the elimination of substantial waste in the media supply chain. A year ago, we highlighted the need for media transparency, with five calls to action; one viewability standard; third-party measurement verification; transparent agency contracts; fraud elimination; and brand safety. The entire industry stepped up, including strong partnerships with Google and Facebook to take action on their platforms. The progress has been impressive, about 90% complete on delivering the appropriate standards and measurements. These efforts enabled us to cut waste and reduce media cost by 20%. In addition, we have eliminated waste related to excessive frequency. A deeper look at third-party data indicated that some consumers were being reached by our ads 10 to 20 times in a month, significantly higher than our suggested average of three. We reduced excess frequency and reinvested these savings to increase media reach, the number of consumers seeing our ads, by about 10% and trial building activities by 50%. We see further opportunity moving from wasteful mass marketing to mass one-to-one brand-building enabled by data and technology. In China, where 70% of our media is digital and 30% of our sales are in e-commerce, we have one of the largest data management platforms in the country, which we use for consumer analytics. We can effectively manage frequency and engage people when and where it matters. We saved 30% on digital spending in China while increasing digital reach by 60%. We're reinventing advertising from mass clutter to less doing more. For example, Olay China was running up to six different ads at a time and changing ads every two months. We now focus on one highly effective ad and stick with it over time. With fewer ads and lower frequency, we focus on creating deeper one-to-one engagement by improving in-store presence. With these interventions, Olay China has delivered its fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, with media spending down 50% over the past two years. With our access to data and analytics and experienced purchasing professionals, we can bring more media buys in house. We're returning to one-stop shops where it makes sense, reuniting media and creative. We're implementing a fixed and flow model, reducing the number of agencies on fixed retainers, while flowing creative resources in and out on an as-needed basis. These changes not only reduce the number of agencies and save money, but lead to better quality, greater creativity, and faster ad development cycle times. We've delivered nearly $1 billion of savings in advertising agency fees and production costs over the last four years. We see more savings potential in these areas, along with more efficiency in media delivery. We expect the majority of these savings to be reinvested in more effective delivery of ads to more consumers. We're continuing to drive savings in the organization, redeploying resources closer to customers and customers, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of our business to operate at the speed of the market. We're focused on cost productivity and cash. We've made great progress on working capital. Over the past five years, we've improved receivables by three days, inventory by 10 days, and payables by more than 30 days. We're driving out cost in inventory with our supply network transformation. We're making progress toward our vision of synchronizing the supply chain with real-time, point-of-sales data with the consumer purchase triggering updates to our manufacturing schedules and orders of materials to suppliers. Our six new mixing centers in North America are enabling faster customer response times and optimize mixed product loads to improve customer service levels. P&G consistently holds best-in-class receivables positions. We're making further improvements by leveraging technology, using robotic process automation to digitize key elements of our work process. Over the last three years in North America, we've delivered $100 million in savings and improved cash flow by reducing days outstanding by more than a day while simultaneously improving productivity, reducing roll-off (29:19) by 30% and organizational cost by 50%. An important cash productivity project has been supply chain financing, which we continue to expand. This program, which is a win for suppliers and for P&G, has yielded nearly $5 billion in cash in the five years we've been driving it. We improved payables by five full days last year on a constant currency basis. Now, alongside the productivity work, we're making needed organization structure and culture changes to position us to win in the changing retail and competitive landscape. We're moving more resources into the businesses and closer to the consumers we serve with higher accountability, more agility, and greater speed. We're simplifying organization structure and clarifying responsibility and accountability. We're tailoring the organization to win by category and by market. One great example is Greater China, moving from minus 5% sales in fiscal 2016, all the way to plus 7% in fiscal 2018, behind China-specific innovations, more on-the-ground resources, and better execution across all trade channels at the speed of China. We can't afford this level of on-the-ground resources by category in all markets. The direction in smaller markets has changed from every category managing low-level activities in each country, to each category building a framework at the start of the year and enabling the local market experts to run the business consistent with those plans. The Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, and distributor markets group is a great example. The group has accelerated organic sales growth from double-digit declines to strong growth over the last year. We're supplementing our internal talent with skilled, experienced external hiring to improve category mastery. We're strengthening compensation and incentive programs. A year ago, we increased the granularity of annual bonus awards, moving from about 20 bonus pools to over 100, tying incentives closer to results individuals deliver. Last December, we announced that the board's Compensation & Leadership Development Committee modified the performance stock program available to our top 200 or so leaders to include relative sales growth metrics and a total shareholder return modifier to ensure awards reflect performance versus external competitive benchmarks. These changes go into effect this fiscal year. Last month we announced further adjustments to the annual bonus program, increasing the percentage of total compensation at risk, increasing the weighting of business unit results versus company results, now weighted 70% business and 30% company versus 50%-50% in the past. We've widened the payout factors for the business unit and the company components to 0% to 200% of target and increased the number of people participating in the program. Each of these organization and culture changes are aimed at creating a company designed to win in today's market, with today's consumer, at the speed of the market : more agile, more accountable, more efficient, more productive. Our focus on superiority, enabled by a strong productivity cost savings program and supported by an improved organization and culture, will yield faster growth, higher margins, and strong cash generation. I'll turn it back to Jon to cover the outlook for fiscal 2019. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: The dynamic macro environment from this past fiscal year \u2013 geopolitical impacts on markets, tariffs, intense competition, rising input costs, headwinds from FX \u2013 will continue to confront us in fiscal 2019. We've attempted to construct guidance ranges that reflect this reality at their midpoints and through the range. We expect to make further progress on market share, but there will widely continue to be a gap between retail sales and P&G sales as trade inventories continue to contract, until we annualize more of the investments we've made over the last year and until new price increases are reflected on our results. We're taking a price increase of around 4% on Pampers diapers in North America. Just yesterday, we began notifying customers across North America that we're taking a list price increase on Bounty, Charmin, and Puffs brands, which averages around 5% across the category on an annual basis. Bounty and Charmin pricing will be effective October 31, and Puffs in February. As commodity prices and foreign exchange rates continue to move, we'll take pricing when the degree of cost impact warrants it and competitive realities allow it. There is uncertainty and will be volatility with these pricing moves. They will negatively impact consumption. We'll have to adjust as we go and as we learn. Against this backdrop, we're currently expecting organic sales growth in the range of 2% to 3% for fiscal 2019. We expect organic sales growth to be driven by organic volume growth. Pricing will start the year as a drag on sales growth but should turn positive by the end of the fiscal year. All-in sales growth is forecast in the range of in line to up 1% versus last year. This includes a headwind of about 2 points from the combination of foreign exchange and acquisitions and divestitures. The all-in outlook also includes the impact of lost sales from the dissolution of the personal healthcare joint venture with Teva at the start of the fiscal year and the assumption that we'll close the acquisition of Merck's OTC business at the end of the calendar year. Our bottom line guidance is for core earnings per share growth of 3% to 8%. This range includes a $900 million after-tax headwind from the combination of foreign exchange rates and commodity costs, $0.5 billion from FX, and the balance from commodities. At the midpoint of the range, fiscal year core earnings per share guidance is $4.45 per share. Excluding the macro impacts, the low, mid, and top of the core earnings per share range each reflect double-digit earnings per share growth. Interest expense, interest income, and non-operating income will be a net drag of about 2.5 points on core earnings per share growth. We estimate the core effective tax rate will be in the range of 19% to 20% for the year, adding about 2.5 points to core earnings per share growth. This tax rate is just 2 points lower than we first projected when we discussed the impacts of U.S. tax reform, given we have now had the time to fully assess the nuances of the new laws. We expect diluted share count to be at 2 percentage points lower in fiscal 2019. We plan to deliver another year of 90% or better adjusted free cash flow productivity. This includes CapEx in a range of 5% to 5.5%. We'll continue our strong track record of cash return to shareholders. We increased our dividend in April, as I said earlier, for the 62nd consecutive year. We expect to pay over $7 billion in dividends and repurchase up to $5 billion of stock in fiscal 2019. The shares repurchase range factors in the cash required to complete the acquisition of Merck's OTC business during the year and cash spent on other deals. Our guidance is based on current market growth rates, commodity prices, and foreign exchange rates. Significant currency weakness, commodity cost increases, or additional geopolitical disruptions are not anticipated within this guidance range. As you consider the quarterly profile of your sales and earnings estimates, please keep in mind the pricing dynamics I described earlier. We'll mitigate more of the commodity and FX headwind in the second half of the year. Productivity savings should build as the year progresses. As a result we expect somewhat stronger organic sales growth in the second half. Bottom line results will be pressured most in Q1 and improve throughout the year. Now I'll hand it back to David for some quick closing comments. David S. Taylor - Procter & Gamble Co.: While the external environment presents many challenges, we're making important progress, and we're accelerating the pace of change. Our efforts to extend our margin of competitive superiority, to drive productivity savings to fund investments for growth and enhance our industry-leading margins, to simplify our organization structure and increase accountability are all aimed at one thing : delivering balanced top and bottom line growth that creates value of the short, mid, and long term. We know we have more work to do, but we're up to the challenge, and we're committed to take the actions needed to win. And with that, Jon and I are happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. Your question first comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks very much. Good morning. David S. Taylor - Procter & Gamble Co.: Good morning. Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I just want to talk a little bit about pricing overall, at least pricing as it flows through on the P&L being down call it roughly 2% this quarter. In the release and in the commentary today, you talked about a couple of different things. So investments made in consumer and customer value, retail execution, of course driving trial as you've talked about. So if you could maybe parse a little bit for us some of the investments you're making, what's showing up in store, the couponing element, because obviously it was a very big spread between what happened with the U.S. Nielsen data through the quarter and what the reported U.S. organic felt like. And then what your visibility is or confidence is that volume will continue to respond, that this shouldn't be placed in the bucket of they're buying volume and this too shall pass if you pull back on some of these investments that you've mentioned. Thanks. David S. Taylor - Procter & Gamble Co.: Okay. I'll make some comments, and then certainly Jon can jump in on a couple more thoughts. First, the interventions that we've made to date have made sure that we got back in pricing corridors that we know position our brands to win over time. And then the superiority then kicks in when you're in a reasonable range. We've made those across the business, and frankly I'm encouraged by the share results we're seeing. And I feel we've gotten to a very good place now. We'll have to see what happens going forward with competitive pricing and the pricing we're taking. But right now the trends to me are very positive, indicating the interventions on both customer and consumer product are making a big difference. We announced \u2013 or Jon mentioned a little bit about two of the categories that had been under the most pressure because of rising commodity cost, pricing is going into the market, one now on Pampers in Baby Care, and secondly later this fall on Family Care. These are aimed to address commodity costs the entire industry is experiencing. So I believe that the interventions that we've made, and the investments we've made, are showing up, whether it's the U.S. or China or across the world, the trends of share growth are indicating that P&G is getting more competitive on the key brands and key categories that really matter to the company's growth. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citi. Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. Could you talk a little bit more about China, because those numbers sounded actually terrific to me? 10% growth in the fourth quarter is great. So, number one, what was the cost of that growth? Did your margins go up or down, maybe for all of fiscal 2018 relative to 2017? What's your outlook for growth in China for fiscal 2019? And I know you said that Baby turned positive in the fourth quarter. But how much of that growth was driven just by SK-II and Olay? Are other categories like Oral Care or whatever else kicking in to the China growth? Just more color on that market would be great. Thanks. David S. Taylor - Procter & Gamble Co.: Sure. I'll make some comments on that. And we're very pleased with China. You know the trends. We talk to this at probably every investor conference, the minus 5% to plus 1% to plus 7%. We've improved across the majority of brands, and frankly the fourth quarter was very encouraging at plus 10%. And we've got six or seven categories that are growing or holding share. Baby's been the one exclusion, and it's turned in the fourth quarter to growing sales. And Baby in China started growing share in the hyper and online channels, which is critically important. And to me the breadth is strong. The fact that e-commerce, most of our brands now are holding or growing share, and in the hyper are growing share, is very encouraging to me. Yes, SK-II and Olay were very important, and they grew. But again, it's broad-based. Fem Care grew 18%. We've had very strong growth now for two years on power Oral Care, and that's turning. Fabric Care was, I think, mid to high single digits recently. So businesses that have struggled in the past, the superiority investments and importantly the organizational change that puts on the ground capability is now getting this operating at a speed that is showing tremendous progress. I think we mentioned earlier, front half 6%, back half 8%, all trending in the direction we want. So I'm very encouraged by it. Jon? Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: And with that, just briefly, both before-tax and after-tax margins increasing year on year. So it's been a productive investment, and we expect that to continue. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust. William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. Can you just, I guess, delve a little bit further into Grooming in terms of, I guess, what you were talking about on Harry's and what you're seeing? It did seem like there were some positive data points, or I guess you had talked about some positive data points, that maybe it had bottomed out intra-quarter. So have we seen the bottom? Are you seeing kind of increased competition as we move into the back half, and kind of how should we look at that over the next year? David S. Taylor - Procter & Gamble Co.: A couple comments. The interventions we made last year clearly have made a difference, and you've seen that in the U.S. share results. The fact that they turned positive over the last three and six months is a strong indication. We've got our eyes, though, very wide open. Harry's is expanding distribution in Walmart. We expect continued competition online, both in the U.S. and now in several markets in Europe. However, this time we're being much more attentive to making sure we support the business online and offline, both in the U.S. and in Europe, and frankly across the world. And it's reflected at the total positive trends on Grooming share if you look globally and in the U.S. I do, though, want to be very open about we expect the competitive environment to stay very heavy for a while, and the right actions would be get within pricing corridor, superior products, improve your in-store execution, and then we've stepped up our investment and capability online, both in U.S. and Europe. And most recently, we've been gaining new users at a faster rate than our competition the last couple months, even in the U.S. So we understand and see the opportunity, and we're going to address in each market, online or offline, what it takes to grow, because we clearly have the superior products, we clearly have the ladder that gives us the tools to win. And now that we're putting innovation in disposables mid-tier in the premium tier, I think we're well-positioned now to grow this business. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning, folks. Thank you for letting me ask a question. I wanted to stick on the topic of diving a little bit deeper into just some of the segments. Profitability or margins were particularly soft in Baby and in Fem. I presume that's predominantly the input cost environment, hence the pricing. Can you confirm that? And then can you go a little deeper in Fabric and Home? I was surprised to see the margin degradation there, and I was also surprised to see the reference to investments in consumer and customer value, given the strong innovation you've had in that segment. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: Thanks, Jason. You've just mentioned the three categories where the commodity cost impacts are the most significant, from both a pulp and energy basis on the paper businesses, and clearly from a petro-complex standpoint on the Fabric Care business. Those are also businesses where freight costs and delivery is a relatively high aspect of the cost structure, and as you know, the transportation market, particularly in the U.S., has presented us with some challenges as the year progressed. So that is indeed \u2013 you rightly cite the reason why margins are compressed in those businesses. As we make moves, both from an innovation standpoint and a pricing standpoint, we expect to recover that margin. We did make some investments in Fabric Care in the U.S. in both customer value and consumer value, and that's really just designed to continue the momentum in that business and continue pushing that market. And business has responded very well, with volume up 6%, value also increasing, and so we're reasonably happy with those choices. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yeah, thanks. Good morning, everyone. I was hoping you guys could reconcile this dynamic of \u2013 Jon, to your point, P&G has very good margins, industry-leading margins. But at the same time you have a lot of competitors that are money-losing, and it almost seems like capital is unlimited out there right now for startups. So I'm just wondering how you guys internally think about that dynamic because it doesn't look like \u2013 or it doesn't feel like that trend is going to slow down anytime soon. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: Well, I think, Nik \u2013 and Dave can comment on this as well \u2013 we've talked about the need to offer competitive value propositions across all price tiers that we choose to compete in, and that's versus multinational competitors. It's also versus local and regional competitors and startups. And we need to be more productive from a cost structure standpoint to do that and still generate the margins that we feel we need to earn. And so that's why we keep talking about the combination of three things. One is increasing advantage, which does allow us to price above the market at times; productivity, which funds the investments in advantage and also provides margin; and also consumer and customer value competitiveness. All three of those have to go together for us to win, whether that's versus a startup or an established multinational competitor. David S. Taylor - Procter & Gamble Co.: The only thing I'd add to that is what you say is very real. I mean, you face reality, there are some people coming into categories that are aggressively spending. What we're choosing to do is make sure we're being more competitive in protecting our businesses. And to me when we do that and leverage the tools that we have, I think we're in a good place to be able to sustain the appropriate support to build the brand over time. And that may call for us at some times, in some countries, and some brands to be more aggressive to make sure that we don't cede a good bit of market share when we truly have a better proposition for consumers and a sustainable proposition. And I think that's one of the opportunities, if I look back over the last couple of years, is when the first (49:24) is a very substantive competitive threat, to make sure each category and each country addresses the appropriate action. And that'll look very different depending on the category, the country, and the competitor. But clearly we believe that the combination of these five elements of superiority positions us well to be able to sustain both share and margin growth over time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning, guys. So I hate to belabor the pricing point. You guys mentioned progress in a number of areas in the last fiscal year ex organic sales, but margins and profit ended up being disappointing. I think you were only up 1% year over year. You'd originally expected 5% to 6%. I get that commodities ran up, so I'm not necessarily looking to go back through that. But what's surprising is when there is large commodity pressure you're also seeing negative pricing, and the pricing decelerated throughout the year. It doesn't sound like we should expect much recovery of that in fiscal 2019, and perhaps even commodity pressures above pricing yet again. So I'm just trying to understand the forward-looking strategy at a very high level, perhaps taking advantage of your presence on the call, David. Is this lack of pricing power just sort of more the reality of the marketplace now with the retailer pushback, a competitive branded competitor environment, private label pressure, et cetera? Is it more of a purposeful choice in your minds to drive P&G market share, as you articulated, and hopefully reinvigorate organic sales growth? I'm just sort of wondering, is this a new normal going forward where we shouldn't expect much pricing from P&G, and how you think about that at a very high level. David S. Taylor - Procter & Gamble Co.: Yeah. First, no, I do not think that the new normal is we don't have pricing power, at all. What I do believe is it varies by category when you take pricing and how much you take pricing. It is not unusual in several categories \u2013 so if I take the one that we announced yesterday on tissue-towel. It's not unusual for the industry to wait until the commodity costs build up to a certain level to be able to take pricing; then there's a threshold, you take it, and you do recover. If you look over time, over three, five years in many of these industries \u2013 and I've got a lot of familiarity with the tissue-towel industry \u2013 we've been able to recover those costs. And do I see anything fundamentally changing that tells me we could not recover those costs well? Not at all. I believe superior products at competitive prices will win, and I believe in time the industry has to address input costs. And it just sometimes doesn't happen in the first three to six months that you see those. The other thing that I very much believe is, when executed well, superior products command premium pricing. And we've got excellent examples of that, whether that's China or the U.S. And, again, it just causes us to have to up our game on the level of superiority, and it has to up our game on the productivity in the periods of time we have to bridge costs going up before we're able to address that, either with innovation or with pricing. But we do not accept that we've lost pricing power. We do not accept that any category doesn't have the responsibility over time to grow. But it's the over time, and there'll be smart times to do it. And we learned a lot from two or three years ago when we may have been too aggressive trying to recover and got ahead of the market. But over time, very committed to deliver the sustainable margin growth and sales and share growth that I think our investors expect of us. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Just to \u2013 David \u2013 follow up on that. And you mentioned over time want to focus on 2019 as time and get a sense of your confidence in the guidance. First, in terms of the acceleration in top line of 2% to 3% organic sales, what does that assume in terms of price/mix versus volume? Is it more kind of \"Marlboro Friday,\" \"Tide Thursday\" type pricing and couponing, so price/mix there? And then the 2% to 3% top line turns into a pretty wide range of EPS at the 3% to 8%. That suggests, obviously, a large range on margins. I understand all the uncertainties, but want to understand how much those uncertainties are macro uncertainties versus competitive or consumer uncertainties. So to understand the flexibility you need there. And then lastly \u2013 and don't take this the wrong way, but do you consider \u2013 did you consider \u2013 not giving guidance at all, particularly given some of the transformation you're going through, the fact that it's back-half weighted again, and what you've admitted to be a lot of uncertainties in the marketplace? Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: So let me take that one, and David can jump in. First of all, the relationship between volume and price and the top line guidance estimate, Ali, as I mentioned, we expect over the total fiscal year basis, the organic sales growth to be volume driven. So volume will drive most of that. I also mentioned in the prepared remarks that pricing will be a negative impact on the top line for the first half or so, and then become positive in the second half. So the relationship between volume and price will evolve as the year progresses. Even the price increases that we've talked today don't become effective until close to the end of the calendar year \u2013 actually one of them in October, and I think the other in February. So we're going to continue to see for the next couple quarters some price degradation. But as pricing is implemented in the marketplace, we should see that situation reverse itself. Relative to the bottom line guidance, I think you said it very well. And David talked about it in his remarks. We're operating in a very dynamic environment. We try to reflect that reality in terms of the width of the range. The combination of foreign exchange, currency, the real uncertainty associated with trade and the political environment, and even the potential spillover into consumer purchase choices, it's just a very dynamic time. And I think there are opportunities within that, which is why the high end of the guidance range reflects a meaningful progress, but there are also challenges within that. So we're just trying to be representative of the reality that we see as we sit here today. And generally we feel we have a responsibility to give investors an indication of in fact what we see in front of us and what we're working towards. And as you know we've moved away from two things relative to guidance over time. One is quarterly guidance, which we don't provide. So this is just a fiscal year slice. And we've also moved away from a lot of guidance on the internals in terms of individual margin components, for example, because with currency and commodities, those move all over the place. I will manage that but we don't need to distract you with that. So that's kind of how we're thinking about the guidance. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to focus again on price. I mean, the environment, whether it's macro, retail, has changed pretty considerably since the last time you guys needed to push through price. So it would be great if you could talk about the different ways you can try and realize price this time around, beyond just the diapers and tissue-towel that you mentioned. Are there other categories you're looking at? Have the levers changed? Do you think about not only straight list, but also reducing ounces in the tube or bottle or package count, which I assume was what you're doing in diapers and tissue-towel? And are there other areas, whether it be concessions for fuller truck loads, the focus on premium end? Just am trying to understand the potential leverage you may have to push through top line improvement and how that compares in developed versus emerging markets and how much volume you'd be willing to sacrifice in order to get price? Thanks. David S. Taylor - Procter & Gamble Co.: Sure. Let me make just a few comments on that, because we absolutely have many tools to address price. Certainly there's straight list prices, and we've got some that we just announced. The majority of times we do pricing, it's coupled with innovations. So the consumer value can actually improve, but the higher price, you can recover cost to commodities. We've done that for years in many of our businesses and done it successfully. Again, the timing may not line up perfectly with the input cost increase. We've done a lot of resizing when we think that works well and helps keep a critical price point. We've done a number with new pack sizes. We certainly can use innovations with new forms to create new price points and price expectations. There's also the tool of promotional spending, and again that varies widely by country, where it can often be a de-escalation of promotional spending is a way to get average price up, and again depending on the market dynamics can be a smart choice. One of the reasons we're trying to put more decision space into markets where appropriate is that they can be a little more agile. And if you take U.S. and China as the two probably best illustrations, what we want is each category to understand exactly what's required to grow both their sales, their top line, and their bottom line over time, and they'll have the appropriate strategy then to address what tool in the pricing toolbox to address that over time. And again I think that China is probably the most successful. The last two years we've seen sales growth, share trends moving very much in the right direction, and at the same time, as Jon mentioned, the structural financials have improved, and it's largely been superiority driven, supported by a lot of cost savings that allowed us to invest in the demand creation, as well as a lot of productivity to make sure the money we spent is very efficiently spent. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: Yeah, I would just add one tool to the arsenal, which will be familiar to you, and that's just being as \u2013 and David referred to this \u2013 as productive as we can across the cost structure so that we have the flexibility to adjust when competitive realities dictate that we do that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Powers with Deutsche Bank. Stephen Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, thanks. Good morning. So, David, last quarter you described things as not business as usual at P&G, underscoring the need to deliver more balanced top and bottom line progress and really issuing at least what I heard as an incremental call to action. But this quarter, on what seemed like pretty similar results to me at least, you seem a lot more upbeat. So I guess my question is what's driven the change in tone? And I definitely see that the market share trends at retail have improved, but it's obviously still coming at a cost. So just a little bit more expansion on why you believe future results will be more balanced. And I agree the volume and the market share trends are impressive. But to Lauren's initial question, as you pull back on the promotions and the couponing over the course of fiscal 2019, what gives you confidence that the volume and share momentum can be sustained? And if I could tack on a related point, maybe, just with regards to your SG&A efficiency this quarter, if you annualize the lower SG&A versus consensus expectations, it's like a $1 billion positive GAAP on a full year, and that's an amazing run rate if it's sustainable. But I guess the risk that I'm grappling with is, in pulling back so dramatically, is there a risk that you're jeopardizing long-term business health by cutting back on important investment? And I know you've said you're not, but the gap is just so sizable, I feel compelled to ask the question. So thanks a lot. David S. Taylor - Procter & Gamble Co.: All right. Steve, let me take the first part of that question and then ask Jon to cover some of the specifics on the SG&A efficiency and the annualization question that you have. Again, my comments and certainly the optimistic view going forward, it is underpinned heavily by the share growth and the fact that many of the things we've been working on over time to get the proposition \u2013 the total proposition \u2013 we talked of five elements. Those don't happen immediately, and they don't happen on every brand in every country. As more are falling in place, we're seeing things to me that are very positive. The global value share trends over the last two years are getting better and better, and just recently turned positive. It's the first time this year, last year, where the total company in June was positive, driven by strong North America growth. Go back two years ago, we said we had to fix U.S. and China. We had to address a number of key categories. Each of those sequentially is getting better. U.S. share meaningfully better, from losing 0.3 [percentage points] to losing 0.1 to flat, to past three months plus 0.3, past month plus 0.6, and it's driven by the right things. It's driven by products and packages and better and more efficient communication. That I think is sustainable. And what is happening now, and the phasing does affect certainly quarters, is recovering a lot of the input cost and T&W cost, transportation and warehousing cost, has taken time. And, yes, the competitive environment is very difficult, which is why we've said we're not business as usual. We know we have to take more cost out, and that's why we're doubling down and looking to accelerate many of the cost savings that we've planned over several years into tighter time frames. That's being worked. We don't disclose everything, but clearly accelerating productivity, put smart investments in the right area of the superiority, and recovering cost when it makes sense with the right tool and pricing does give me confidence. And the fact that the consumers are voting for us more and more often, volume growth is strong, we're seeing many of the brands' household penetration start to move, and then you see China, India \u2013 we didn't talk a lot about \u2013 double digit, and the outlook is very strong. And if you're starting to get the U.S. growing, you get China growing, India, Europe has had solid growth, you start to feel you've got more and more of the key countries that drive profit and share and volume positive. And for that reason I think we can double down, but we need to do it faster. And we need an organization that owns outcomes in each market, and that's what we're building. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: And relative to SG&A, going back to the importance of balanced top and bottom line growth, which we feel very strongly about, it wouldn't make sense to dial back on support for brand creation and the spending behind that, and we haven't done that. So media, for example, was up 4% in the quarter, even as we faced a very difficult year with lots of cost increases in the balance of the business. You wouldn't see the volume and consumption trends that you're seeing if we weren't continuing to support the business at relatively high levels. So the commitment to grow that top line and through the productivity efforts that David mentioned and the innovation efforts, which build margin, continue to build the bottom line, it remains fully present. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you; good morning. I just had a quick follow-on question regarding the pricing. Just hoping to hear more from you on what the retailers' response has been to the price increases that you've announced, and how have these increases possibly changed your different price gaps? And then a question on innovation. If you look back at your fiscal 2018, how would you characterize your pace of innovation and how successful it was, especially in the context of the organic sales growth? Did it meet your expectations? And then as you look forward into fiscal 2019, could you touch on your innovation pipeline and how different it may be from last year? Will there be more and/or will the innovation be more breakthrough type of innovation? Thanks. David S. Taylor - Procter & Gamble Co.: Okay. There's many questions in there. The first one is difficult to answer in that we don't talk specific retailer reactions other than if you step back and look at the industry, we're all pressed to recover cost. Transportation and warehousing costs are experienced not only by manufacturers but by retailers. And so I believe broadly, as long as it is cost-justified and/or innovation provides meaningfully new benefits, I believe retailers will work with us. And I think generally the industry has to recover a rising input cost. All participants are experiencing this all over the world. So that's all I really can say. I won't talk about individual retailers, and the one we've just announced today we're just announcing today, so I don't have any data there. And generally if I look around the world, not just the U.S., generally I believe when you have innovation and/or there's an environment that it's justified, we've been able to get pricing. And so that's all I'll comment on that. In terms of the pace of innovation, it has increased in terms of the impact, and that's what we really want is this magnitude of superiority. And if I take just the one example that we've talked many times, but it matters, is things like the scent beads. Growing that faster, moving it from a $250 million business to a $500 million business, adds real, profitable sales to the company. And we are driving those faster and harder, and driving things like household penetration, which is more users. Those are the most profitable additional cases you can get, because you've already got a sizable business, and you're leveraging the assets you've employed. We want more innovations, and what we're working on is more meaningful innovations. We learned a lot, if I go back several years ago, with over-proliferating very minor extensions. What we want is meaningful, consumer-significant innovations, and where smart, differentiated solutions that help our retailers. And we'll work with them as well. And that's an area I expect we'll do more going forward, because the combination of those two addresses the consumer and customer value, and that's a key part of our superiority strategy. Pipeline, I believe, is very strong. And the fact that we put additional effort into our upstream innovation several years ago, those will come out over time. And both Jon and I have mentioned that we have many tests going on to continue to make sure that we learn fast and then bring to the market consumer-meaningful innovation that will grow category size, which helps both us and our retailers. Operator : Next we'll go to Joe Altobello with Raymond James. Joseph N. Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I guess I just wanted to dig in a little more into your 2% to 3% organic sales growth outlook and from a different direction. What are you guys assuming in terms of the overall market growth rate for this year? And I assume, if it's still in that similar 2% to 3% range, with trade inventory reduction reductions still a modest headwind likely, I'm trying to understand how much in the way of market share gains you're assuming, or does that imply, in terms of your organic growth rate for this year. Thanks. David S. Taylor - Procter & Gamble Co.: Okay. Just a comment on the 2% to 3%, and I may need to get last part of your question \u2013 I wasn't sure I got it. The 2% to 3%, as far as market growth, it is in the, still the 2% to 3%. And understand, we have to grow a little faster because consumption tends to be ahead of what we experience because there have been inventories that have come down across the world as e-commerce grows, especially in the big, major markets. And I'm not seeing anything dramatically different. We'll see what happens in places where there's pricing, the benefit of pricing versus the impact on the consumer with volume. But right now to me the market is pretty steady. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: So we should \u2013 with the dynamics that David mentioned, if we grow organic sales 2% to 3%, we should be building share against our current assumption of market growth, because consumption will be slightly higher than that. Operator : Next we'll go to Jon Feeney with Consumer Edge. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Good morning. Thanks very much. You cited \u2013 real quick one \u2013 you cited 120 basis points of mix factors within your gross margin buildup, mix and other factors. I'm assuming, the way you wrote that, that's mostly mix. And could you \u2013 I know you're not going to guide on that, but could you give us a sense what the single largest buckets are of negative gross margin mix and maybe if there's a big positive one in there that's offsetting and what you're thinking about for 2019 as far as gross margin mix as a contributor based on current trends? Thanks. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: So I'll give you two examples of what are driving mix, one of which will hopefully reverse itself, the other will hopefully not, and I'll explain that. One example of negative mix is the decline year on year in sales in blades and razors, which is one of our most profitable businesses. So as that business grows at a lower rate or declines \u2013 or grows at lower rate than the balance of the business, that generates a negative gross margin mix hurt. That, I hope, resolves itself as we continue to strengthen results in that business. Another example that might be somewhat counterintuitive \u2013 and tongue in cheek, I hope it doesn't resolve itself \u2013 is when you grow a premium-priced item \u2013 David mentioned beads, for example \u2013 at a rate that's faster than the balance of the business, those items \u2013 and both Tide PODS unit dose and fabric enhancer beads are examples of this \u2013 have a higher price. They have a significantly higher penny profit, typically dollars higher than comparable items, but the combination of those yields mathematically a lower margin, meaning that when you sell more of those products, your gross margin declines. But it's a very good day, and we want to sell as many of those items as we can. So John can help you offline kind of tease out those components, but those are two of the largest drivers in the quarter that we've just completed, for example. Operator : And next we'll go to Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Thanks and good morning, everybody. Wanted to ask about where retailers are in increasing focus on private label. Less so as it kind of your relates to your ability to price and more to do with how brand-new companies compete when retailers seem to want to put more private label on shelves. An example of this would be your reductions in shaving and razor prices a year ago with a large wholesale club coming out with its own private label about a year after those reductions. And just sort of related to that, where do you believe your current shelf space is a year from now or so relative to current levels? David S. Taylor - Procter & Gamble Co.: Just a couple of comments on that. First, we've experienced retailers putting varying levels of focus on their retailer brand, private label. And we understand for most retailers it's an important part of their strategy, both from an equity standpoint and a margin revenue standpoint. We've also shown over time \u2013 and probably Europe is the best illustration, because it's most advanced there \u2013 the ability to win in that environment, where the leading brand and the retailer brand can mutually be successful. And it comes back to the same point. What you have to have is the brand consumers prefer, because then retailers want to carry it, because it builds the basket. And, yes, they will continue to put emphasis and at times add shelf space. And if we're doing our job and have the innovation, it comes at the expense of somebody else. It's one of the reasons you have to watch in the middle without a distinctive positioning in a brand that's meaningfully different to consumers. It is the reason why we believe that I think retailers will continue to put more emphasis, in many of the cases, on the retailer brands and we can accelerate our growth. But it means the advantages has to be enough that the consumer that's interested in the retailer brand is not the consumer that typically buys our brands. And when we really do our job, we're able to source from a variety of sources, but frankly usually it's the brands and the weaker businesses in the middle. So that part I think is still true. I don't believe the \u2013 you'll see a spike when a retailer makes a new push in either a category or broadly into retailer brands. But, again, we've seen this over time \u2013 Europe is the best illustration, but the same is true in the U.S., where there may be a spike and then it steadies out with what the consumer wants. And they will follow the shopper just as we do. And our job is to make sure more shoppers pick our brands. I believe we can earn shelf space over time with innovation, and that's certainly been our experience. You better be enough different. And, again, it's especially, to me, successful when you bring meaningful difference or a new form to the consumer or a new benefit area. It's one of the reasons PODS and beads have been able to grow both share, sales, profit, and space in most cases, because the retailer wants to feature it for the reason Jon mentioned, for us and for them, because the penny profit's higher for them, and to me, the absolute sales and total profit for us. And the consumer gets a product that's meaningfully better. And that's a good example of superiority in place, and shelf space can be earned. And frankly the expectation I'd have for each of our businesses is they need to have propositions that are able to earn shelf space from the retail partners because it's in their best interest. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC : So following up on pricing, are you going to continue to increase the gap between your own price points? And you just positioned Luvs diapers cheaper before, and now with the announced price increase in Pampers, should we expect the price realization gaps in between those two brands to continue to widen? And the same for Bounty and Charmin brands, I guess these brands own (1:17:04) basic and essential value extensions, basically going back to the point about private label as you mentioned in the last few quarters. And in the long run, should we continue to see P&G use high-low strategies with the premium products funding price reductions in the key categories, as happened in Grooming and now in diapers? Thank you. David S. Taylor - Procter & Gamble Co.: Okay. Just a couple comments on the pricing. Bounty and Charmin are pricing to recover the cost increases we and rest of the industry participants are experiencing. We have, for each of our brands and for each of our tiers, desired pricing corridors that we know the consumers believe provides good value. Over time, we'll take the actions that make sure we address that. I believe in many of the categories where we're taking pricing on our premium brands, there is pressure for all participants to understand what they think is right to deal with the rise in input costs. We'll have to respond to whatever each of the competitors choose, and we'll do so. And, again, we've learned very clearly what is the pricing corridor where we can grow share over time. We also know that we increase the margin of superiority, we often can grow that price point. And that, again, is one of the reasons why we're doubling down on the superiority. I believe, and again, we've gone through times where input costs went up significantly, where we've priced and we were able to build our business. And if something happens with another retailer that causes an issue \u2013 or rather another competitor \u2013 we'll have to be agile in each market, and we'll do so. Operator : And next we'll go to the line of Jon Andersen with William Blair. Jon R. Andersen - William Blair & Co. LLC: Good morning. Thank you for the question. I want to ask about e-commerce. Sorry if I missed it, but what percent of the total company sales were e-commerce related in fiscal 2018? How would you characterize your major brand market shares online versus offline at present? And also if you could talk briefly about margins, offline, online, where you stand today, and what some of the opportunities are ahead to improve that. Thank you. David S. Taylor - Procter & Gamble Co.: Sure. First, we're very pleased with the progress we've made in our total e-commerce business, led primarily by the two biggest, been U.S. and China, but also Europe as well and in other markets, Korea very strong. We're winning online with 30% growth this year. We're up to $4.5 billion (1:19:20) and in total, to answer specifically your question, it's about 7% of our global sales. And the other point I'd make generally, it varies widely by country and category, but our market shares and our margins online are roughly equal to offline. And for that reason we \u2013 and we want to keep it that way as best we can, because we're channel agnostic. We can go wherever the shopper wants to go and have our brands available. And then we work the cost structure and certainly our productivity programs to ensure we can do that. But again, that varies widely by category and country because we have to deal with whatever the competitive set is in that category and country. But broadly, 7% global sales and markets, shares, and margins roughly equal. Operator : And next we'll go to Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC : Thanks; good morning. First a housekeeping question if I can. Jon, so the tax rate guidance for fiscal 2019 at 19% to 20%. Is that permanently lower, and if so what's driving it? Is that also reflective of the cash tax rate? And then, David, the broader question on the Beauty and natural space. And you touched on the three tuck-in deals that you've transacted on so far this year, small but add to brands like Olay and SK-II. Can you compare and contrast the approach here, maybe versus past mistakes that Procter has made in the beauty space? Maybe how you'll integrate these differently, maybe let them sort of operate on a standalone basis? Views of managing the number of brands in the portfolio? The company obviously went through a period of rationalizing the portfolio and reducing the number of brands. Maybe talk about that now as you sort of enter back into more active M&A. And maybe touch on the pipeline a bit and broadly what can we expect going forward. Thank you. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: Okay. First on the taxes. Based on everything we know today, which will change tomorrow, we'd expect 19% to 20% to be a good estimate of a going tax rate, probably closer to 20% than 19%, Kevin. The cash tax rates, if you consider the cash that we're paying on the repatriation tax, which has already been recognized as a one-time charge to earnings, inclusive of that would be a little bit higher, but not significantly. David S. Taylor - Procter & Gamble Co.: I'll give just some comments on naturals. First, we're quite committed to winning there. And while, yes, I will talk a minute bit about the acquisitions, to me the biggest part of the growth is coming from organic innovation from our existing brands. I mentioned almost every brand now has deeply understood that consumer. And what they've been working \u2013 and the reason it's taken time in some of the cases is we want to solve the trade-off between often the \u2013 either free-of or full-of, depending on how it's expressed in each market benefit, as well as with the core functional benefit of the category. And the ones I mentioned at least, whether it's Tide purclean or Gain, Febreze ONE, Whisper Pure Cotton, and recently Pampers Pure Protection, all of these are showing very good growth in the market because they're addressing the consumer need. And, yes, we will supplement when we see an opportunity that gives us either people capabilities or a key brand that we think we can turn from a small brand into a bigger brand and grow over time. How I'd contrast this with potentially the past is we're not looking to proliferate a ton of brands and we want a huge number of small brands. What we want to do is grow our big brands, and we believe it's very important that we plant seeds in high-growth areas, either organically or through acquisition, and make them bigger brands by bringing our capability be it product, package technology, communication, and/or supply chain, which often is what enables you to turn these brands from small, unprofitable brands to mid-sized to bigger profitable businesses. And that's exciting, because almost every category, there is a meaningful consumer segment, and it is growing fast. And now we've got our organic innovation coming in the market and supplements. And then the last thing, you asked what are we doing on the ones that we have purchased, is at this time we are leaving them where they are right down and giving them time. We want to learn from them and then make available the capabilities that P&G has without imposing anything that would slow down the rate of growth or our rate of learning. And to me, I'm quite excited about what we're learning from Native and Snowberry, and what we will learn from First Aid Beauty, and frankly what we'll learn from our healthcare acquisition, because we have talent coming in, and we have products and brands that we think are catalysts for accelerated growth. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Steve Strycula with UBS. Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Two quick questions on the portfolio. First with Fabric Care. Can you speak, Jon, a little bit more about the acuteness of where we saw the price/mix investments and what catalyzed the behavior? And should this be a trend that was contained to the fourth quarter, or should we expect it to linger on through fiscal 2019? And then for the second part, I can appreciate that there's a number of different items happening in Grooming right now competitively. But all in, should we expect revenues for that business segment to be down in fiscal 2019? Thank you. Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.: So on laundry in the U.S., we made several investments to deliver price competitiveness consistent with the comment David made earlier about maintaining pricing within proven quarters for growth. And you saw that generate some solid growth. Where we go from here will depend a lot on the competitive environment. We want to drive as much top line revenue as possible, but we know we need to be price competitive to do that sustainably. David S. Taylor - Procter & Gamble Co.: And the other, we don't give guidance by business, but no, I have not accepted and we have not accepted that any of our core categories are not going to grow in fiscal 2019. We'll have to deal with what happens in each market, and for Grooming, our aspiration is to grow that business. And we're putting the innovation and plans in place just to do just that. David S. Taylor - Procter & Gamble Co.: I think that wraps up the call. Thank you very much. We appreciate the questions. And again, I'd just close with we're quite committed to making the changes, and the strategy to me is showing the right signs in terms of positive share trends, and we're quite committed to delivering balanced top and bottom line growth. Thank you all. Operator : That does conclude today's conference. We thank everyone again for their participation.",

P&G would like to remind you that today\u2019s discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G\u2019s most recent 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the Company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from these projections. Additionally, the Company has posted on its Investor Relations website, www.pginvestor.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP and other financial measures. Now, I will turn the call over to P&G\u2019s Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller. Jon Moeller : Good morning. John Chevalier joins me her. We\u2019re going to keep prepared remarks brief, reflecting a fairly straight forward quarter and Investor Day right around the corner. I\u2019ll provide headlines on the quarter\u2019s results, just a few comments on strategic focus areas and update fiscal year guidance before turning the call to your questions. We continue enabled by superiority periodicity, and creating a more focused, agile and accountable organization and culture to make important progress towards our objective of delivering balanced growth, top line, bottom line and cash. We\u2019re accelerating organic sales growth driven by strong volume and consumption growth with market shares improving and now growing on an aggregate basis. Organic sales grew 4% driven by strong organic volume growth of over 3%. Pricing was neutral to the quarter, with mix of positive 1 point impact to top line growth. 9 of 10 global categories grew organic sales. Skin and Personal Care grew in the teens, Personal Health Care double-digits, Fabric Care, Home Care, Feminine Care, Family Care and Grooming each grew organic sales mid-single-digits. All-channel consumption, very strong up in line with organic sale, and ahead of the underlying market, driving as I said, a return to aggregate market share growth. 33 of our top 50 category country combinations held or grew value share, up from 26 last fiscal year, 23 the year before that and 17 in the year before that. So, reversing that progression 17, 23, 26, 33 of our category country combinations holding or growing value share. Similar progress in our largest market, the U.S. In September of 2016, one category growing share over the past 12 months; September of \u201817, 3 categories; currently, 8 categories. 40 basis points of share growth overall in Q1. While making good sequential and absolute progress, we do continue to face several top-line challenges. We\u2019ve previously highlighted market level issues in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf markets, Iran, Algeria, Egypt and Nigeria. We have large businesses in the Middle East and Africa, nearly $3 billion in sales. Organic sales in the region were down nearly 10% for the quarter, about half-point drag on Company organic sales growth. We had a very good quarter in Grooming with organic sales up 4%, but we\u2019re going to continue to face challenges on this business. As I said, we\u2019re making good progress, look at the U.S. for example. U.S. male blades and razors value share up from a 4-point decline in fiscal \u201817 to down 30 basis points in fiscal \u201818, to nearly a full-point increase over the last 6 months, which includes the impact of a major competitive launch during the period. We\u2019re growing all outlet volume share on a past 1, 3, 6 and 12-month basis. But, we are going to continue to face challenges from value share competition in store and online in several markets. While we expect trends to improve, Baby Care sales were down for the quarter. We continue to build on the success of our diaper pant products. Pampers is a global share leader in pant style diapers with nearly a 30% share of the form, which is growing at a double digit rate. Taped diapers have been the soft spot, mainly in the mid value tiers. So, top-line challenges remain and improvement won\u2019t come in the form of a straight line, but consumption volume, sales and share are each progressing nicely. Moving to the bottom line, core earnings per share were $1.12, up 3% versus the prior year. Foreign exchange was $260 million earnings headwind, about $0.10 a share. On a constant currency basis, core earnings per share up 11%. This against the backdrop of significant commodity and transportation cost challenges, about an additional 5 points, net strong underlying earnings progress. Core gross margin contracted 150 basis points as 170 basis points of productivity improvement were offset by 100 points of commodity cost increases, 60 points of foreign exchange headwinds and 160 points from mix, innovation investments and other impacts. Adjusting for currency and commodities, underlying gross margin was up slightly. Core SG&A costs decreased 80 basis points as a percentage of sales, down 150 basis points excluding FX impacts, driven by sales leverage and strong productivity improvement. As a result, core operating margin decreased 80 basis points including 250 basis points of productivity savings. Constant currency core operating margin increased 50 basis points. Excluding currency and commodities, core operating margin was up 150 basis points. Cash flow remains dependably strong with adjusted free cash flow productivity of 95%. We returned over $3.1 billion of cash to shareowners, nearly $1.3 billion in share repurchase and $1.9 billion of dividends. In summary, a very strong quarter, solid consumption, volume and organic sales growth driving positive market share trends across categories and geographies. Strong constant currency core earnings per share growth and continued high levels of cash generated and returned to shareowners, all in the most dynamic and challenging environment we faced in a very long time. We\u2019re accelerating change to meet these increasing challenges and to further improve results. As you know, we\u2019ve made a deliberate choice to invest in the superiority of products, packages, retail execution, marketing, and value, not just in the premium tier, but in each price tier where we compete, strengthening the long-term health and competitiveness of our brands. We\u2019re making solid progress on extending our margin of advantage and increasing the quality of our execution, which shows in these results. Additional investment will be needed to continue this progress. The need for this investment, the need to offset macro cost headwinds and the need to drive balanced top and bottom line growth, including margin expansion underscores the importance of productivity. We\u2019re driving cost savings and efficiency improvements in all facets of our business, approaching the midpoint of our second 5-year $10 billion productivity program. We\u2019ve consistently delivered $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion in annual cost of goods sold savings. We expect to be towards the high end of that range again this fiscal year. We\u2019re eliminating substantial waste in the media supply chain, delivering nearly $1 billion of savings and agency fees and ad production costs over the last 4 years. We see more savings potential in these areas along with more efficiency and media delivery. We\u2019re continuing to drive savings and organization cost. Total enrollment now down nearly 30% since the start of our first productivity program, closer to 35%, when including contractor roles. We\u2019re focused on cost productivity and cash. We\u2019ve made significant progress in all areas of working capital. Over the past five years, we\u2019ve improved receivables by 3 days, inventory by 10 days, and payables by more than 30 days, enabling us to fund capital spending needed to transform our supply chain. Over the last seven fiscal years, we\u2019ve averaged nearly 100% adjusted free cash flow productivity, returning an average of over 110% of reported net earnings to share owners through dividends and share repurchase.  We\u2019re making needed organizational structure and culture changes to position us to win. We\u2019re taking steps to simplify the organization structure, clarify responsibility, increase accountability. We\u2019re supplementing internal talent with skilled, experienced, external hires, and approving category dedication and mastery. We\u2019re strengthening compensation and incentive programs, increasing the granularity of annual bonus awards, expanding participation in both the annual and three-year bonus programs, changing evaluation metrics to focus more on performance relative to competition and performance of local teams. We\u2019re increasing the amount of total compensation at risk and widening the payout range to deliver greater upside reward and downside consequence from over or under performance. Each of these organization and culture changes are aimed at creating a company designed to win in today\u2019s market with today\u2019s consumer at the speed of the market, more agile, more accountable, more efficient, more productive. We\u2019re committed to lead constructive disruption in our industry across all areas of the value chain, innovation, supply systems, consumer communication and brand building, retail execution, sustainability. Constructive disruption will be the central theme of our discussion on Investor Day. Moving to guidance. With one quarter of the year complete, we are maintaining organic sales growth guidance of 2% to 3%. Pricings return progressively more positive as we go through the year, but this will increase volume uncertainty and volatility. We now expect all-in sales growth in the range of down 2% to in line versus last year, reflecting 3 to 4 negative points of foreign exchange. We\u2019re maintaining core earnings per share guidance of 3% to 8%. Where we land in this range will be significantly impacted by FX, by commodity costs, by the competitive and consumer response to plan pricing and by our own productivity efforts. We\u2019re not currently at the high end of this range. In less than the three months since our last earnings release, the foreign exchange headwind on earnings increased by $400 million after tax, $900 million in total for the fiscal year. The Turkish lira devalued 25%, the Argentine peso more than 40%, the Indian rupee nearly 10%. Commodity costs are expected to be $400 million headwind. Crude oil, a key feedstock for many raw materials is up more than 50% than this time last year. Trucking costs will likely be up 25% or more versus last year\u2019s insulated levels. Combined, FX and commodities are now $1.3 billion after tax or $0.50 per share headwind versus last fiscal. This excludes elevated transportation costs. As commodity prices and foreign exchange rates move, we will take pricing when the degree of cost impact warrants it and competitive realities allow it. We\u2019ve already announced pricing in U.S. Baby Care and Family Care, we\u2019ve also informed retailers that we will increase prices on several products in Home Care, Oral Care and Personal Care, coupled with innovation launches early next calendar year. We\u2019ve announced pricing in several developing markets including Argentina, Turkey, and Russia to offset at least a portion of the FX impacts. There will be volatility with these pricing moves. Competition may attempt to take advantage of our moves for short-term market share gains. Overall category consumption may be negatively impacted. We\u2019ll simply have to adjust as we go and as we learn. Importantly, excluding the macro impacts, every point of our core earnings per share guidance range reflects strong double-digit constant currency earnings per share growth. Our priority going forward will remain protecting superiority building, value accretive investments in the business. We won\u2019t allow short-term pressures to derail the progress we\u2019re making towards sustained, profitable top-line growth. We continue to expect another year of 90% or better adjusted free cash flow productivity and another year of strong cash return to shareholders. We expect to pay over $7 billion in dividends and repurchase shares worth up to $5 billion. This, factors in the cash required to complete the acquisition of Merck\u2019s OTC business during the year and cash benefit and other deals. Our guidance is based on current market growth rates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Significant additional currency weakness, commodity cost increases or additional geopolitical disruptions are not anticipated within this guidance. As you consider your quarterly estimates, keep in mind that pricing to offset FX and commodity pressures will begin to go into effect only later in Q2 and accelerate in the back half of the year. So, costs and FX challenges will persist and likely worsen as we move into Q2. While we expect to continue making progress on consumption and share, the top line organic sales comp in Q2 is more difficult than we faced in Q1, which will have an impact on reported growth rates. To sum up, while the external environment presents many challenges, we\u2019re making important progress and are accelerating the pace of change. Efforts to extend our margin of competitive superiority, to drive productivity savings to fund investments for growth and enhance our industry-leading margins, to simplify our organization structure and increase accountability are and will continue driving improved results. We\u2019re leading disruption across the value chain to consistently and sustainably grow sales, margins and cash. We\u2019ll talk more about all of these efforts at our Investor Day on November 8th, in Cincinnati. We\u2019ll also insure you have ample opportunity to interact with Company leadership. We hope you\u2019re able to join us, either in person or the webcast. I personally look forward to seeing and catching up with each of you. With that, we\u2019d be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : Hey. Good morning. So, this the best organic sales growth you guys have had in five years, clearly it\u2019s probably better than you originally expected, and perhaps even early September at the conference circuit. But, at the same time, it\u2019s only one quarter, the comp was easier. You mentioned some caveat. So, just taking a step back at a high level, as you look at the underlying drivers behind this quarter\u2019s top line results, how confident are you that you\u2019ve regained some top line and market share momentum here and the drivers in the quarter and more sustainable and the combination of your efforts over the last few years as opposed to just specific to this quarter? And also, within that answer, the sequential progress you made in the quarter on the organic sales front. Can you talk about what geographies drove that and how much of that you think is more P&G market share improvement as opposed to improved category draw? Thanks. Jon Moeller : All fair and good questions, though many. I feel very good -- we feel very good about the quality of the top line growth in the quarter and the quality of the number that we\u2019re reporting. We feel good about that for several reasons. As I mentioned, consumption is up in line with our top line progress, which is very encouraging. That\u2019s reflected in improvements in market share, which I talked about both in the U.S. and globally. The breadth of the growth is encouraging with 9 of 10 categories growing sales in the quarter. I mentioned some of the growth rates in our prepared remarks. Importantly, also just the early read in October, roughly 55% of the way through that month, a month means even less than a quarter, but we haven\u2019t seen a drop off that you would expect to see in terms of shipments or consumption if the quality of the first quarter number was lacking. Also important is the growth in our largest market, largest and most profitable market, the U.S., where we were up 4% and volume growth of 5%. Also, the impact of pricing, both in the U.S. and broadly now neutral versus negative. So, all of that leads to our confidence in the numbers for the quarter and the results that we\u2019re seeing. There are though some things that are very important to note as we try to project that forward. One, we face very-strong competition, both multinational and local who are very active in the marketplace. Two, the pricing that we need to implement to offset commodity and foreign exchange cost is largely not in the marketplace today. There is very little that\u2019s actually on the shelf. As I mentioned, that will come into play later in Q2 and as we go through Q3 and Q4. And we know that that will introduce volume volatility and uncertainty. So, we\u2019re happy with the numbers. I don\u2019t think there is anything that\u2019s suspect within those results, but we still have a lot of work to do as we go through the balance of the fiscal year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Olivia Tong : Thanks. Good morning. Following on that question, I mean, maybe we can turn a little bit to the emerging markets. Because clearly you saw the strong acceleration in organic sales, I imagine in emerging markets too, which sort of contracts with the fears in the market over GDP growth slowing and the impact of FX depreciation. So, can you walk through what you think drove the improvement in that particular area? Are you mixing up or -- upwards, have you started to take pricing in some cases where inflation has warranted it? And are there particular markets or categories that have surprised for the better, and what are doing to keep that momentum going? Thanks. Jon Moeller : Thanks, Olivia. Against the backdrop of the broad question on the strength of emerging markets, as always, those markets are extraordinarily dynamic. I mentioned some of the challenges we\u2019re facing, for instance in the Middle East and Africa. And I would be not serving you well to overlook those. Having said that, the large developing markets where significant future growth should present itself, continue to perform fairly well, double-digit growth -- high-double digit growth in a market like India, Brazil doing well in the quarter. China, if you still consider that a developing market, up 7% the past 12 months, which is a significant acceleration from where we were at negative 5%, just two years ago. Encouragingly, that progress in those markets reflects the Company progress across the breadth of the portfolio. So, it\u2019s not just one category driving sales. I guess, the question quite frequently, what if we excluded SK-II and what impact would that have? There isn\u2019t a piece of our beauty business that isn\u2019t growing right now, most of it growing at very attractive rates. Several of our categories in China are growing at double-digit rates and a couple at high singles. So, I continue to believe that -- and this could change tomorrow, but as we said here today, the setup in developing markets is relatively strong, absent those markets with significant geopolitical disruption and absent the markets where we\u2019ve seen significant devaluation, and their pricing will be obviously required. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj : Hey, guys. So, how should investors think about the profit pool of your whole HBC sector right now? So, pricing is not keeping up with inflation. And even going forward with incremental pricing, it sounds like you want to take -- you won\u2019t keep up with inflation. So, gross margins will be down. But gladly, for you guys, you have cut, [ph] you\u2019re doing well on productivity, you can deliver on the bottom line pretty well. But, how do you foresee that looking for kind of the HBC category overall, your competitors in terms of the profit pool? I guess, many of us are trying to figure out, if you\u2019re -- again, kind of this nicest [ph] house on a deteriorating HBC neighborhood, and would just love to hear your perspective on that. Jon Moeller : As I think about it in aggregate, I\u2019m not in a terribly different position looking forward now than I would have been this time last year or this time three or four years ago. There\u2019s -- in terms of pricing relative to inflation, that\u2019s just beginning to be brought into the marketplace, not just by us, but you\u2019ve heard most of our competitors, both multinational and local, talk about the same thing. And that will work its way through the income statement as we go through the balance of the next calendar year and the end of this calendar year. I don\u2019t know how that\u2019s going to play out, but I don\u2019t have any definitive indication that it\u2019s going to play out negatively. Innovation continues to be a significant source of margin and profit expansion within the industry. That is alive and well. And you see it in items like unit dose detergents, in fabric enhancer, beads, you see it in adult incontinence, you see it in some of the natural launches, pure, Pampers as an example. So, I continue to believe that that is a significant source and important source of both category growth for us and retailers, and margin opportunity for both us and our retail partners. You mentioned productivity. There are additional tools available today to us and others that offer unprecedented opportunities in terms of automation and digitization to improve cost, both on the manufacturing floor and on the office floor. Tax rates for U.S. companies. Tax outlook is significantly better than it\u2019s ever been with lower rates than have been the case. We\u2019re seeing, and this is important, I think, modest increases in market growth rates, including and most importantly in the U.S. And that has a big impact on behavior, both across the manufacturing environment and the retail environment, as you would expect. There are definitely headwinds. Interest rates are a headwind for U.S. borrowers. That differential in interest rates between the U.S. and other countries is leading as we all know to significant strengthening of the dollar, which is a real challenge that we\u2019ve talked about. And commodity costs and transportation costs are up significantly. Well, if I look back over the past decade in different years, all of those factors have been present. So, there is nothing unique other than perhaps the very significant macro impacts which hopefully will be short-term in nature that preclude HBC companies from building value for shareholders as we go forward. All of the long-term fundamentals that you have to believe in that support market growth, which is the most critical driver of growth, top-line and bottom-line are in place, population growth, income growth in industry that largely continues to focus on innovation as a way to grow its business. And it\u2019s early in the earnings cycle, but if I just look at other competitors that have reported, J&J and Unilever as two examples, I\u2019m very happy to see significant progress on the top-line in those companies as well. That is not indicative of an environment that is problematic for any of us. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citi. Wendy Nicholson : Hi. Good morning. Just, first a housekeeping question on Gillette. Those numbers, the Grooming segment was a lot stronger than I\u2019d anticipated based on the track channel in the U.S. So, can you talk about the Gillette performance in the U.S. specifically, and how much is the Gillette shave club growing versus what we\u2019re seeing in track channels? And then, another question if I can. The pricing conversations you\u2019re having with retailers, there has been a lot of skepticism I guess among investors I talked to about whether you\u2019re going to be able to get those prices through, whether retailers are going to push back, whether you\u2019re going to have to do more promotion to offset that et cetera, et cetera. But if you\u2019re taking more pricing in Home Care and Personal Care, maybe the conversations you\u2019re having with retailers are more productive. So, can you comment on that just at a high level? How easy is it going to be for you to realize that pricing in the market? Thank you. Jon Moeller : The grooming business in the U.S., let me just -- first of all, it continues -- it is very strong, plus 10% sales growth in the quarter on volume growth that\u2019s higher than that in the face of the competitive expansion. As I was very careful and hopefully clear to describe in our prepared remarks, there will be challenges ahead. But, it gives us a lot of confidence that the strategies we\u2019re putting into marketplace are in fact working as we expected them to. As it relates to offline versus online, that\u2019s much more than a Gillette shave club dynamic. That\u2019s a broader channel switching dynamic. And we continue to do reasonably well though we have more work to do offline in that business -- excuse me, online in that business versus offline. We believe based on the data that we have -- we\u2019re seeing significant growth in Gillette shave club users, and believe based on the data that we\u2019re the only one growing users in the U.S. That\u2019s not a global comment. So, generally, I mean, we\u2019re very cautious. We have a lot more work to do. The competitive activity in the space is very strong and early in its life cycle. But, we take a lot of encouragement from the progress we saw in the quarter. Operator : And next, we\u2019ll go to Nik Modi with RBC. Nik Modi : Yes. Thanks. John, I was hoping you can talk about just the Skin Care business in general. I mean, that\u2019s an area that outside of China and SK-IIhas struggled for a number of years. And I was hoping, you could just kind of touch on it in the context of A, what\u2019s going on with the skin care category in China, because it\u2019s not just you guys, it seems to be a lot of the beauty players are having some pretty nice success there right now. So, just curious about what you are seeing from the consumer standpoint? And then, maybe you can touch on Olay Whips and kind of what that has meant to the overall Olay franchise? Jon Moeller : Nik, I\u2019m going to come to that. I\u2019m actually going to step back. I apologize. I\u2019m not good at keeping track in my head of multi-part questions. But, this isn\u2019t your fault, this is my fault. So, I neglected Wendy\u2019s -- to answer Wendy\u2019s question on pricing. I want to come back to that. And then, I\u2019ll come to Skin Care and Olay, Nik. Sorry about that Wendy.  In terms of support for pricing, the commodity cost impacts we\u2019re talking about are significant. So, I talked about oil as important feedstock for many of our raw materials being up 50% year-on-year, transportation costs being up 25% after a year where they were up significantly before that. And those are all costs that retailers see and understand, in large part because they face the same cost increases in their private label brands, and certainly from a transportation standpoint, they\u2019re seeing all the impacts that we are in and more. The questions that investors are raising relative -- all the questions that you mentioned relative to the pricing are the right ones to raise, and I wouldn\u2019t dismiss any of them. But, the conversations to-date have been encouraging. What we don\u2019t have visibility on, today, are the whole array of competitive activities. So, it\u2019s certainly not sitting here today declaring victory. There\u2019s a lot of work and volatility ahead of us. But, so far, nothing, as I said earlier, that\u2019s definitive that has made overly concerned. Now, Nik going back to your questions. The Skin Care, if you look at Skin and Personal Care, which is how we look at the business, organic sales increased in the quarter double-digits about 13%. And very, very encouragingly, that growth is broad based. So, SK-II, up over 20%, the balance of the Skin Care portfolio, up close to 20%, Personal Care, up mid to high-single-digits, deodorants growing as well. If you take the 7% beauty segment growth and exclude SK-II, you would have seen growth of 5% in Q1. So, again, that\u2019s reflective of very broad growth in the beauty portfolio. We\u2019re growing share across that total business with all segments, either growing or holding share. In terms of China, we delivered across the Skin and Personal Care portfolio 22% growth, in Q1, SK-II did lead that as you would expect. But, Olay was close to 20% growth. Olay Skin has now delivered 6 quarters of double-digit growth in China, led by both, innovation, things likeOlay Whips but also the revitalization of the in-store experience and the Olay beauty counters. So, we also are seeing good growth not just offline but online in the Skin business, where e-commerce sales, if you look at the past 12 months in Skin Care up 60%. They\u2019re up 50% calendar year-to-date ahead of the market. So, it\u2019s a broad success story, not simply SK-II. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Stephen Powers with Deutsche Bank. Stephen Powers : Hey. Good morning. Thanks. Maybe just to build Jon on your response to Wendy\u2019s question on pricing. I want to drill down a little as it relates to Baby and Family, if I could. Just because that\u2019s been where I think the pricing discussions been mostly focused, given your pricing announcements last quarter. And on the one hand, I think we\u2019re all expecting some improvement there, which is obviously constructive. But on the other hand, as you called out, there continues to be investment in value to your products and in particular Luvs for you. So, I was hoping you can address any potential tension that you\u2019re seeing there, and how you see aggregate net pricing trends unfolding as a result, both in Baby and Family and in other categories as you take incremental pricing. I\u2019m just curious, if this is something specific to Baby that we should think about or if this is sort of tug-of-war if that\u2019s the right label, is something we should extrapolate to other categories. Thanks. Jon Moeller : Steve, my answer will likely frustrate, and I apologize for that in advance. But, it\u2019s really too early to sort this out in a meaningful way for you. All signs -- early signs are positive, both in terms of retailer acceptance of the price increases and importantly of competitive announcements, both branded and private label manufacturers and their intent to take pricing. But, it\u2019s not in the marketplace broadly. There are -- some of the Baby Care pricing is in the market, but it\u2019s really, really early. We\u2019ll know a little bit more by Analyst Day, but not a lot, given that\u2019s only three or four weeks away. So, this is a conversation we\u2019re going to continue to want to have as we go through the end of the calendar year and the beginning of next calendar year. I apologize for what may rightly appear like a non-answer but it is just because I don\u2019t have one yet. Operator : All right. Next, we\u2019ll go to Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to just ask again about the U.S. because at our conference in September, Jon, I feel like you really went out of your way in several forms to discuss a disconnect between the strength that we were seeing in Nielsen and what you expected to see in terms of reported results. So, mentioning things like long-term inventory destocking and the retail trade, dynamics in year-over-year kind of couponing, cost to implement some of the in-store activity that you\u2019re doing in the improved display and support for your innovation. So, if you can just talk about what changed frankly between early September where again you really made a point of saying, don\u2019t look at the scanner, and how things shaped up. And as we look forward, those three, really the two dynamics, the long-term inventory destocking at retail and cost to have a better presence in store to support your innovation. How you expect that to impact U.S. trends going forward. Thank you. Jon Moeller : Fair question, Lauren. Part of the discussion that we had on retail inventory destocking, you\u2019ll recall, was -- and frankly the largest part of the question had to do with channel mix and the relative mix of online versus offline, with online being generally lower inventory carrying channel. And of the things that occurred as we went through the quarter is that some of the significant investment that online retailers were making in consumer acquisition, decreased relatively significantly. And so, while still growing ahead of offline, the growth rates in online at a market level, as the quarter worked its way through, ended up being significantly less than had then the case, for instance, the quarter before, the quarter before that. And that\u2019s one of the drivers of the impact. There was also a fair amount of channel mix beyond just the offline online dynamic that changed as we went through the quarter, which had an impact on where we actually came out. We were -- we tried to be very clear that the investments we were making with retailers were in assets, not just additional trade spending, and that we hoped that those investments in assets, whether that was displays, whether that\u2019s placement, would earn the return that we expected it to, and that that has largely occurred. And we had even greater strength than we expected on some of our innovation launches, Pampers Pure for example, which now leads the naturals segment and diapers in track channels. So, a number of relatively favorable things came into play. Can those reverse themselves over time? Certainly. But, I also look at the progress that we made in market share as indicative of relative strength that should continue working for us as we go forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello with Raymond James. Joe Altobello : Thanks. Hey, guys. Good morning. So, I guess, first, Jon, you did allude to a modest acceleration in market growth, both here as well as internationally. I was curious what was driving that? Is it more volume-driven? Are you seeing more trade-up or is this more reflective of less emotional activity? And then, maybe secondly on Grooming, obviously that stood out. And I know it\u2019s one quarter. I know you\u2019ve got to great pains this morning to say it\u2019s one quarter. But, what would we need to see for you guys to declare that that business is fixed? Thanks. Jon Moeller : Drivers of the increase in market growth are all of the above, Joe. So, if you just look at our business as representative, the 4% volume growth -- sorry, 4% sales growth in the U.S. was on the back of 5% volume growth. So, there is some acceleration in unit consumption. We continue to see the premium parts of the portfolio in many cases growing at a faster rate than the balance of the portfolio. So, it\u2019s innovation and mix up, that\u2019s occurring. The promotion levels aren\u2019t significantly different quarter-to-quarter or year-on-year. I mean, you have the Nielsen data. The percentage of our volume that moved on consumption on promotion is not significantly different from either the prior quarter or the year-ago quarter. And fundamentally, we have as we all know, a very low unemployment rates, some increases in wage rates, generally strong consumer confidence. And it\u2019s playing through across all the drivers at a very modest level of acceleration in market growth that you would expect to see. On Gillette, I\u2019d like to see 4 to 6 to 8 quarters of continued progress, and that\u2019s certainly what we\u2019re working to achieve. Operator : And next, we\u2019ll go to Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Bonnie Herzog : Thank you. I wanted to circle back to China with a couple of quick questions. What was your total organic sales growth in the quarter? And then, how did that compare to category growth? And then, as you look out how sustainable do you think category growth in China is? And wondering, if you guys have any concerns about consumer pushback on U.S. brands and manufacturers due to tariffs. Thanks. Jon Moeller : We haven\u2019t seen any appreciable impact of tariff situation on consumer attitudes towards brands. We certainly didn\u2019t see that in the quarter, again with very strong growth rates across several of our brands. There is nothing that we\u2019ve seen that would indicate a significant drop in the market growth rate across categories, either consumption levels or appetite for premium products. In fact, the categories again that we continue to do best on or the categories that we\u2019re best positioned from a premium offering standpoint and the categories that we\u2019re struggling more with, that\u2019s less the case. The organic sales growth in China for the quarter was 4%. Again, if you flash back to minus 5% couple of years ago to plus 1%, plus 7% last year, there is a fair amount of volatility within the quarters. If we look at underlying consumptions and market share growth, market share actually improved quarter-to-quarter in China. So, I expect over couple of quarter period, we\u2019re still solidly in the mid singles to high single digit growth rate there. I know there is a lot of concern that\u2019s been expressed, not just with regard to our categories but more broadly. I understand the GDP figures were down that were released today, but GDP at 6.5% still offers significant opportunity. So, there is nothing that we are aware of today that has significantly changed our outlook for our business in China. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : Hi, Jon. So, just following up on pricing and couponing. So, you spoke about the plans to increase pricing before on a few more categories but you\u2019re also planning on reducing couponing in the U.S. going forward as you probably got more of conversion ratio than I think you probably expected. And so, how are you thinking of net pricing premium against your branded competitors and private label going forward? And related to that, are you concerned on pantry stocking because of couponing, in particular in the Costco couponing in the month of September and also on SK-II in Asia? Thank you. Jon Moeller : Well, I don\u2019t want to get into a lot of details. The business in October and the momentum that it continues to indicate is not indicative of a situation where that will lead you to the believe that the July-September results were driven by a lot of pantry stocking, either here or in China across the brand portfolio. I don\u2019t think that that is the case. In terms of our spread versus others on price, net price, I don\u2019t expect a significant change. You are right. We have reduced couponing in a couple of categories; and you\u2019re right that was because those coupons over redeemed and we wanted to pull that -- dial that back a little bit. There, we\u2019re also -- we go through cycles and it\u2019s different by category, by market where we\u2019re introducing new products for example, and you\u2019ll see an increase in the rate of couponing and promotion to drive trial. But, there\u2019s nothing that is systemic, either up or down that I see relative to our desired net price premiums vis-\u00e0-vis our competitive set. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark Astrachan : Yes. Thanks and good morning everybody. I wanted to ask about private label or retailer brands, however you want to think about that. It seems like 12 months ago or more, there was certainly a lot of talk increasing amounts of shelf space, emphasis being put on the category partly just because it made under-indexed, especially in the U.S. and partly because it can put pressure on pricing. And fast forward to today, it seems like it\u2019s far as less pronounced. I guess, one, do you see that from a retailer standpoint in your conversations? And two, if yes, what do you think has driven that, and do you believe that that can ultimately result or should ultimately result in A&P spend and sort of more of a traditional spends continuing or ultimately increasing off of current levels to sustain what seems like some momentum against that shift? Jon Moeller : Private label, as you know, is primarily a European and U.S. dynamic, not entirely, but primarily. In Europe, private label market shares are down slightly after three years of basically flat performance. In the U.S., in a couple -- and in the U.S., the percentage of private label that are sold in a given category, varies dramatically from almost nothing to 20% to 30% of business that\u2019s moved in a category. So, as a result of that, we would expect this -- the dynamics are very, very different by category. There are categories where we see continued retailer interest and increasing their private label presence. Private label market share in the quarter we just completed in aggregate was up about 40 basis points. Our share was also up about 40 basis points in aggregate. The category that\u2019s seen the most increase in private label sales is the Family Care business. Our market shares are also doing very well and are increasing in that business. So, I hesitate to tell an overarching private label story because I don\u2019t think there is one. But, it is definitely something that continues to be of interest to retailers across channels. That\u2019s been the case for many, many years. And oftentimes, the increase in private label, which leads to a reduction in branded assortment, it\u2019s very rare that that comes out of the number one or number two position brand in the market. That doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re immune. Private label manufacturers are doing an increasingly good job at delivering quality products to consumers. And so, I\u2019m not dismissive of it in any way, but also I think we\u2019re well-positioned to deal with it. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : Thanks. Good morning. Jon, I wanted to come back to the pricing discussion. And I apologize if I missed this part, the two-part question. What specifically came in better in the first quarter? You have been guiding to declines in Q1 and then gradually getting better. But, what very specifically by region, by category came in better? That\u2019s the first part of the question. And then, the second part is, there still seems like there is a little bit of a wait and see from your perspective on where you can take pricing, what categories et cetera. So, specifically in the U.S., do you view this as a retailer receptivity issue, Walmart recently speaking unsurprising so, about maintaining its lowest price positioning in the marketplace, or do you more see this as a competitive dynamic? Whether this is what\u2019s going on North American Fabric Care with Brazil et cetera? So, any commentary there will be helpful. Thanks for both of those. Jon Moeller : The first question, what changed in terms of our pricing outlook? Frankly, not a lot. So, when we were talking about negative pricing in the first quarter in our own mind, that was kind of a minus 1-point impact where we ended up rounded to neutral. So, there wasn\u2019t a massive change that occurred as we went through the quarter. We did take some additional steps to reduce, both inefficient trade spending and couponing, that improved things a little bit. And then there were price increases that we took in different parts of the world, particularly the developing markets. As the quarter progressed, the FX situation deteriorated rapidly, and that caused us to make moves that we wouldn\u2019t have anticipated at the beginning of the quarter. In terms of the uncertainty looking forward. That is much more in my mind a competitive related concern than it is a customer related concern. And it\u2019s not -- concern is probably not even the right semantic to use. It\u2019s just the reality, when prices start moving in the marketplace, not everybody moves in lockstep and there are different dynamics that are introduced and capitalized on, different view by different manufacturers. So, it\u2019s just very hard to look forward with a pure clean crystal ball and say here\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen. That would be disingenuous. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Steve Strycula with UBS. Steve Strycula : Hi. Good morning and congratulations on a good quarter. So, real quick question on the sales inflection that we saw from this quarter versus the fiscal fourth quarter, a nice step up, the way we cut the numbers, it seems like price mix was a key contributor in the inflection, and also Grooming and Fabric Care. So, my question is, what in your mind really drove the price mix inflection that we saw quarter-on-quarter? And then, at a segment level, what drove the improvement in your view in Fabric Care and any update on China Diapers? Thank you. Jon Moeller : Price mix continues to benefit from our innovation efforts and our efforts to increase our level of superiority and advantage and solving fundamental consumer problems. So, the fastest growing parts of our portfolios, as I\u2019ve indicated before are some of the premium price, more innovative segments where we\u2019ve brought real performance difference into the marketplace, whether that\u2019s unit does detergents, whether that\u2019s fabric enhancer beads, whether that\u2019s adult incontinence products, whether it\u2019s some of the natural products, the net with and benefit efficacy and natural. So, all of that reflective of the strategy that we\u2019ve described, and we\u2019ll talk about more on Analyst Day are playing themselves out in the marketplace. The other difference that I just mentioned in response to the last question is that we are starting to put price in the market as it relates to both, commodities and foreign exchange. And I apologize, I\u2019ve once again failed to remember parts of the question, but that\u2019s the answer of the first part, at least. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Hey. Good morning, folks. Thanks for squeezing me in. Jon, I\u2019ll keep this simple for you and stay focused. I want to delve into the mix drag on gross margin. It was lot bigger than we\u2019ve seen last couple of years and certainly a lot bigger than we expected. I know you mentioned in prepared remarks a couple of things around it, but I was hoping you could give us a little more detail, unpack the components of it. It\u2019s especially surprising to see it in context of the U.S. strength. I guess, I\u2019ve always assumed that part of the mix drag was U.S. weakness. Why are we seeing the acceleration? It sounds like there\u2019s maybe some transitory stuff in there. Can you unpack it and give us the magnitude and expected duration? Thank you. Jon Moeller : Yes. First of all, Jason, it\u2019s wonderful to hear from you without your barking dog. Just kidding. In terms of gross margin, I want to make a couple of things clear, both here and going forward. When you\u2019re in these -- and this isn\u2019t addressing your mix question, I\u2019ll come to that in a second. But I just want to take advantage of your question to make this point. When you\u2019re in an environment of increasing commodity and costs and foreign exchange hurts, it\u2019s almost inevitable that you\u2019re going to see margin compression, both on the gross and operating line. And that results from the simple fact that even if you\u2019re 100% successful with your pricing plans, you are typically taking pricing to recover costs. You\u2019re not taking pricing to recover margin. That\u2019s not that you wouldn\u2019t like to take pricing to recover margin but that\u2019s not typically what you can accomplish. So, I do expect that as we go through the cycle, we\u2019re going to continue to see some pressure. We\u2019ll see if productively cost overcomes, but we\u2019ll continue to see some pressure on margins. Relevant to mix, I mentioned earlier that some of the fastest growing portions of the portfolio are the premium price segments. There\u2019s a very understandable belief, though it\u2019s not accurate that those higher priced segments are higher margin. In fact, what\u2019s true about that belief is that generally they\u2019re higher penny profit per unit. So, we want to sell as many of them as we can. But they often come at a lower margin. So, the math of a shift in the business to unit dose detergents, to adult incontinence products, to pure natural products is a positive one from a value creation standpoint but it leads to negative margin mix. And I expect that to be with us as well as we continue to implement our superiority strategy, again with productivity there too will offset a significant portion of that. And in a benign commodity and FX environment, I would expect this to continue to grow margin. But, that doesn\u2019t mean that that negative mix component would go away. Operator : And your final question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge. Jonathan Feeney : What portion of your total global volume will see a price increase planned, as of right now, by the end of this fiscal year? Rough number would be fine. And more broadly, could you comment about how the pricing process has changed over the past 5 or 10 years with maybe more data driven and sometimes more adversarial or in some cases maybe better relations or more transparent relations with retailers? How that game has changed that what it means us as we look the revenue impact in these price increases? Thank you. Jon Moeller : I don\u2019t think anything significant has changed in terms of how we think about pricing. And some of the important components of that are, we want to whenever possible, link pricing to innovation moves, so that the total value that we\u2019re offering consumers is accretive, not dilutive. And that will cause -- that has a significant impact on the timing on which pricing is taken. I mentioned that the categories in the U.S., we\u2019ve announced additional pricing, we\u2019ll be linking that to innovation which will come in the second half of the year. And generally, that\u2019s a much more successful way to think about this. Short of that and a continued emphasis on that dynamic, no significant changes going forward. In terms of the percentage of -- for very understandable reasons, probably 80% of this conversation has been about pricing and ability to take pricing and ability to keep pricing. Again, I understand that. I am in no way frustrated or surprised by that. But, if I think about the percentage of volume of our internal conversations and planning, and what I really think is driving our business, pricing is a relatively small percent of that dialogue. We need to take pricing in some markets and in some categories. We\u2019ll do that behind innovation when we can. But the much bigger driver of success, both in the quarter we just completed and going forward, is the execution of the broad strategy. Products -- first of all, the category choices that we\u2019re playing in where performance determines brand choice, commitment to deliver superior performance in a superior package, communicated in the superior way, executed with excellence in store at a good value for both consumers and our retail partners, all underpinned by productivity and significant changes in the way that we\u2019re organizing ourselves and strengthening our culture to be more responsive to emerging consumer needs, more efficient in those responses, more accountable in those responses. Those by far are the much more important things to think about as we think about both the quarter and the year going forward. Look, we\u2019ll continue to talking about pricing as we should at Investor Day, but you\u2019ll see the focus much more on that strategy, which again I think is much, much more fundamental in terms of what actually happened in the quarter that we just concluded and what the outlook is going forward. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to Procter & Gamble's Quarter-end Conference Call. P&G would like to remind you that today's discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from these projections. Additionally, the Company has posted on its Investor Relations website, www.pginvestor.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP and other financial measures. Now, I will turn the call over to P&G\u2019s Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller. Jon Moeller : Good morning. Good afternoon. We\u2019re going to keep prepared remarks on the short side today, reflecting a fairly straight forward quarter, our recent Investor Day and the CAGNY conference coming up in just a couple of weeks. We'll share result headlines, comment briefly on strategic focus areas, update guidance for the fiscal year and then open the call for your questions. So, getting right to it, we delivered a strong organic sales -- we delivered strong organic sales growth in the October December quarter, putting us ahead of fiscal year targets. Organic sales grew 4%, driven by volume, pricing and mix. 8 out of 10 global categories grew organic sales, Skin and Personal care in the teens, Fabric Care and Feminine Care high singles, Family Care, Oral Care and Personal Health Care mid-single digits. Each of our top 15 markets grew organic sales with China up 15%, India up 16%, and Japan up 9%. E-commerce organic sales grew nearly 30%. Our naturals entry continued to drive growth including Pampers Pure Protection diapers, Burt's Bees toothpaste, and Native deodorants, which we recently expanded in the Target stores. We\u2019ve built aggregate market share. 34 of our top 50 country category combinations held or grew value share, up from 26 last fiscal year, 23 in fiscal \u201817, and 17 in fiscal \u201816. Within this strong sequential and absolute progress, we continue to have some challenges. Grooming organic sales were down low singles. Global Baby Care trends improved but with organic sales only at the level of the prior year. In total though, consumption volume, sales and share are each progressing nicely. We also delivered strong constant currency earnings growth. Core earnings per share was $1.25, up 5% versus the prior year. Within this, foreign exchange was a $200 million after-tax earnings headwind, about $0.09 per share. So, on a constant currency basis, core earnings per share, up 13%. Gross and operating margins improved sequentially, as expected, net strong underlying earnings progress. Cash flow also remained strong with $4 billion in operating cash flow and adjusted free cash flow productivity of 103%. $2.6 billion of cash was returned to shareowners, $750 million of share repurchase and $1.9 billion of dividend. We completed the acquisition of the Merck KGaA OTC assets, significantly enhancing our international presence in personal health care. We also acquired Walker & Company with products designed to serve the unique needs of consumers of color. In summary, a strong quarter, solid consumption volume and organic sales growth, driving positive market share trends across categories and geographies. Strong constant currency core earnings per share growth and continued high levels of cash generated and returned to shareowners. All delivered while working to address some category specific challenges and against a very difficult competitive and macro landscape. We continue to accelerate change through our program of constructive disruption to meet the remaining challenges we face and to further improve results. Our strategic focus areas remain constant. We\u2019ve made a deliberate choice to invest, as you know, in the superiority of our products and packages, retail execution, marketing and value, not just in the premium tier, but in each price tier where we compete, strengthening the long-term health and competitiveness of our brands. We\u2019re making solid progress on extending our margin of advantage and increasing the quality of our execution, which show in our results, as I mentioned earlier, sequential share progress over multiple years. Additional investment will be needed to continue this progress. The need for this investment, the need to offset macro cost headwinds, and the need to drive balanced top and bottom line growth, including margin expansion, underscores the continued importance of productivity. We are continuing cost savings and efficiency improvements in all facets of our business, approaching the midpoint of our second five-year $10 billion productivity program. We\u2019ve consistently delivered $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion in annual cost of goods sold savings. We\u2019re eliminating substantial waste in the media supply chain, delivering nearly $1 billion of savings in agency fees and ad production costs over the last four years. We see more savings potential in these areas along with more efficiency in media delivery. We\u2019re continuing to drive savings and organization cost. Total enrollment is down nearly 30% since the start of our first productivity program, about 35%, when including contractor role elimination. P&G is a highly profitable company. Before tax operating margins are among the highest in the industry, behind only Reckitt and Colgate, whose margins reflect their concentrations in health care. We have significant below the line advantages, operating with one of the lowest interest expense percentages and one of the lowest tax rates, putting us near the top of the industry in after-tax margin, already highly profitable and aggressively driving more savings. We\u2019re also focused on cash productivity, with significant progress in all areas of working capital. Over the past five years, we have improved receivables by 3 days, inventory by 10 days and payables by more than 30 days, enabling us to fund capital spending needed to transform our global supply chain. Over the last seven fiscal years, we have averaged nearly 100% adjusted free cash flow productivity and have returned an average of over a 110% of reported net earnings to share owners through dividends and share repurchase. We\u2019re making organization structure and culture changes to strengthen our position to win. We\u2019re taking steps to simplify the organization structure, focus clarify responsibility, and increase accountability. We\u2019re supplementing internal talent development with experienced external hiring, and we\u2019re building category dedication and mastery. We\u2019re strengthening compensation and incentive programs. As we discussed in detail at our Investor Day, we\u2019re moving to a new organization structure to further dematrix the Company and provide even greater clarity on responsibilities and reporting lines to focus and strengthen leadership accountability. We\u2019re significantly reducing the level of corporate resources, moving about 60% of corporate roles to the business units and markets. At the same time, we\u2019re leading the constructive disruption of our industry; lean innovation processes to improve speed to market, shots on goal, and success rates of new products; monetizing internally developed technologies to build value and fund even more innovation investment; disruption the brand building ecosystem with digitally-enabled to one-to-one mass marketing; supply chain transformation enabled by robotic process automation; and leveraging digitization and data analytics to drive greater efficiency and effectiveness of all facets of our operation. We are creating a more engaged, agile and accountable organization, operating at a lower cost, focused on winning through superiority, fueled by productivity, working at the speed of the market. We\u2019re working urgently to sustain our near-term momentum and to position P&G to win over the mid and long-term. Moving to guidance. Having delivered a strong first half of the fiscal year, we\u2019re increasing the high-end of the organic sales growth range by a point, making the new growth range 2% to 4%. We have strong innovation and support plans for the back half of the year. Gillette SkinGuard in the U.S. and Europe; upgrades to Tide and Ariel unit dose PODS in North America, Europe and Japan; expansion of Crest and Oral-B Gum Detoxify toothpaste to Latin America; continue the support of Vicks VapoCOOL, NyQuil, DayQuil and Cough Drops through the cold and flu season; Pantene Rose Water Sulfate-Free Shampoo and Conditioner; formula and packaging upgrades on Head & Shoulders; new Olay Vitality masks and creams in China; upgrade on Pampers Cruisers and continued strong support behind the range of Always Whisper Tampax and Always the Discreet innovations we've watched recently around the world. We're innovating and investing to maintain top-line momentum, but we're also realistic about the market and competitive dynamics that will impact us in the back half of the fiscal year. Pricing should remain positive in the back half, but this will increase volume uncertainty and volatility. We face highly capable competitors with strong plans of their own; macro uncertainty stemming from issues like Brexit, a crisis of consumer confidence in France, and trade and other policy impacts that can impact both the top and bottom-line. Our efforts and results fiscal year-to-date and the totality of these tailwinds and headwinds leave us comfortable increasing our organic sales guidance, albeit within a relatively wide range. We now expect all-in sales growth in the range of down 1% of top 1% versus last year, reflecting 3 to 4 negative points from foreign exchange. We're maintaining core earnings per share guidance for 3% to 8%, having delivered about 4% fiscal year-to-date. The combination of stronger than expected organic sales growth and productivity-driven cost savings are offsetting a significantly larger challenge from foreign exchange and commodity costs than we originally anticipated. Our fiscal year earnings outlook includes a potential gain on the sale of land at our Gillette side of Boston. The land sale, if it occurs this fiscal, will likely contribute around a point of earnings per share growth for the year. We're currently forecasting a foreign exchange headwind on earnings of about $900 million after-tax. Commodity costs are expected to be a $400 million headwind and trucking costs will likely be up 25% or more versus last year's levels. Combined, FX, commodities and transportation are nearly a $1.4 billion after-tax headwind, $0.53 per share. As commodity prices and the foreign exchange rates move, we will take pricing when the degree of cost impact warrants it and competitive realities allow it. There will be top-line volatility with these pricing moves. Competition may attempt to take advantage of our moves for short-term market share gains. Overall category consumption may be negatively impacted. We'll have to adjust as we go and as we learn. In any scenario, we'll aim to protect superiority building, value accretive investments in the business. We won't allow short-term pressures to derail the progress we're making towards sustained, profitable top-line growth. Our outlook for items below the operating line is unchanged. We now expect to exceed our target of 90% adjusted free cash flow productivity. This includes CapEx in the range of 5% to 5.5%. There'll be another year of strong cash return to shareholders. We expect to pay over $7 billion in dividends and repurchase up to $5 billion of shares in fiscal 2019. This share repurchase range factors in the cash required to complete the acquisition of Merck's OTC business and other transactions. Our guidance is based on current market growth rates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Significant additional currency weakness, commodity cost increases or additional geopolitical disruptions are not anticipated within this guidance. To sum up, the external environment presents many challenges. To address these challenges and further strengthen results, we continue to accelerate the pace of change. Efforts to extend our margin of competitive superiority to drive productivity savings to fund investments for growth and enhance our industry-leading margins, to simplify our organization structure and increase accountability to constructively disrupt our industry are and will continue driving improved results and will help us achieve our objective of consistently and sustainably growing sales, margin and cash. With that, I'm happy to turn to your questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citi. Wendy Nicholson : Hi. Good morning. Could you talk a little bit more about China up 15%, I think is a lot stronger than most of us were expecting? Could you comment specifically on SK-II and Olay in China and how they did in the quarter? And what your outlook is for the next -- for the second half? Thanks. Jon Moeller : Thanks, Wendy. It's been a strong first half and the second quarter in China. If you look at annually the organic sales progression in China going back three years, then minus 5, plus 1, plus 7 last year and plus 9 for the first half this year; and as you indicated, above that rate in the second quarter. We do not see a sign at this point of slowdown of the consumer in China, as witnessed by those results. Market growth rates continue to be relatively strong. Within China, just like the balance of the business, we have our successes and our challenges SK-II and Olay are obviously in the success column with Skin Care, both SK-II and Olaygrowing strong double-digits for several consecutive quarters. 0 Operator : The next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Good morning, folks. Thanks for slotting me in so early. I appreciate it. Two questions for you. First, the change on the $1.32 billion to $1.4 billion drag on earnings from cost pressure and currency. I think the $900 million you gave on currency is the same as what you gave last quarter. The $400 million on commodities looks to be the same. So, it sounds like the bulk -- you obviously put a lot of focus on freight. Is freight the incremental driver? And if so, why -- kind of what changed, because it seems to contrast with what we\u2019ve seen of a bit of an abatement of something like cost pressure? That\u2019s question one. And question two, another source of strength, and by the way congratulations on the broad-based momentum. Laundry\u2019s acceleration has been impressive. You had a key competitor earlier this week announce plans for a lot of reinvestment. Can you talk about your own investment plans going forward and how you sustain the momentum in the face of what may be a more disruptive competition? Thank you. Jon Moeller : I think, you\u2019re exactly right, Jason, in terms of your interpretation of the drivers of the 1.3 moving to 1.4 in terms of headwind, and that is ongoing premiums and transportation cost. And I think, the situation has exacerbated a little bit simply by the strength of the business and the demand that we\u2019re placing on that transportation system and it\u2019s just reflective of what we see. We\u2019re managing that I think well and putting steps in place, systems in place that should reduce that burden going forward. But, for the balance of this fiscal year, that\u2019s what we\u2019re currently seeing. Our laundry business is doing, as you mentioned, extraordinarily well, had a really great quarter and great first half. And it\u2019s really the poster child in many ways for the strategy that we\u2019re working against, which is performance superiority along with packaging, communication and store execution and value, all working for us in that business with things like unit dose detergents, which continue to increase household penetration and market share. Our share within that segment, as you know, is very high, 80ish percent. Items like the fabric enhancer beads growing double-digits; that\u2019s a premium priced item, all of that driving category growth, which is extraordinarily important for both us and our retail partners, and within that ourselves building share as we\u2019ll do if we are the drivers of category growth. Doing that, through increased investment facilitated by productivity improvement, it\u2019s just as I said, kind of a poster child for the strategy that we\u2019re working against. Henkel and Persil have been strong competitor. If I just focus on the U.S., Persil remains a 2 to 3 value share. We don\u2019t expect competition to stand still. And going back to the strategy, that is what fuels our deliberate choice amongst other things to invest in the five vectors of superiority, always working to improve those and strengthen the long-term health and competitiveness of our brands. We continue to innovate across our Fabric Care lineup; we\u2019ve got a strong spring bundle that we\u2019ll introduce to the U.S. markets in the upcoming quarter. That includes Tide POD upgrades with improved film for better dissolution and perfume upgrades as well as two new scents, also innovating in the liquid space with heavy duty 10x liquid, introducing products and new benefit spaces, Studio Delicates by Tide and Tide antibacterial spray, and there\u2019ll be upgrades on Gain both liquids and flings as well. So, our competition is not standing still, nor are we. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj : So, in the guidance for the year, it certainly seems like you're anticipating, with the risk of a slowdown, a top-line growth. Are you actually seeing anything yet to support that caution? Are you seeing competitive shifts? I mean, certainly you\u2019ve heard from Henkel from a moment ago and before. But are you seeing competitive shifts, are you seeing merchandising or inventory shifts at retailers? And importantly, are you seeing any fatigue with trade-up among the consumers at this point in the economic cycle, and then how sustainable you think that is? And then, within that, this 4% organic growth number, which you continue to deliver on strongly, is anyway to segregate that a little bit in terms of what is same-store sales sort to speak versus new shelf space, new product launches, you mentioned Native and Target, those types of things, just to give us a sense of new versus old in terms of the growth? Thank you. Jon Moeller : So, as it relates to the guidance range, I mean, the move here is a positive move, reflecting more confidence in the business, not a negative move. So, we're increasing the top-line -- the top-end of the top-line guidance range, as you know from 3% to 4%. And we wouldn't be doing that, if we had obvious knowable issues that were confronting us today and didn't have the confidence to potentially overcome them. Having said that, as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, the level of volatility and uncertainty that exists across multiple factors which are out of our control, which impact our business, as you mentioned competitive behavior, which we expect will be strong and response to our share gains, but even more importantly, the macroeconomic dynamics and the significant uncertainty that's introduced into the equation when we start moving price significantly, as we've all seen in previous cycles. So, it expressed increased confidence, not decreased confidence, but with an open eye reality to the volatility of the world that we live in and with the belief that it is too early to declare victory. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Steve Powers : Hey, Jon. I focus on Grooming. It's a difficult business to assess the health of from the outside. Clearly, it was a big driver of strength in the first quarter. You had a drag here in the second quarter. And I know promotional timing and quarter-to-quarter mix just tends to be more-lumpy in that business. But, as you think about the full-year and the momentum in that business, is the first half run rate indicative of what roughly you expect over the full-year, or do you feel as though the second half can show improved momentum off that first half run rate, given initiatives that that business has underway? I\u2019m just trying to understand how you feel kind of red light, green light, yellow light on Grooming, generally? Thanks. Jon Moeller : Thanks, Steve. I apologize. I fell into my usual trap and neglected a few of Ali\u2019s questions. So, I want to go back to those and come back, Steve, to yours. Ali, you asked about, I won't get to all of it, but you asked about fatigue on trade-up, we do not see that. Our premium items are some of the faster growing items in our portfolio. I described what's happening in laundry, for example. That growth is really being driven by items that on a per load basis are premium priced. If you look at private labels as one indicator of trade-up fatigue, or perhaps even the reversal of consumer desire, we don't see significant changes quarter-to-quarter. Europe private label shares remained flat as they have the last three years. It\u2019s obviously different by category; I\u2019m talking on aggregate. And the U.S. private label is up 50 basis points, primarily in three categories. Our share is also up in the U.S. So, there's no indication of a broad scale shift from premium brand superior offerings wholesale to private label. And in terms of the question on, if you will, the equivalent of same-store-sales, I really don't have that data and it's very hard to tease apart. But, what I'll tell you is, we do not win from a market growth or share standpoint if we don't do both. Our core needs to be strong. We need to innovate in our core, indicate in our core, that's the largest part of our business. At the same time, we need to meet the needs, the emerging needs of consumers, which are emerging more quickly than they ever have, whether that's new forms, new segments, new needs, and that -- we've stepped up our activity there significantly. Look at the Naturals segment as one example where our pace of activity is as high as anybody's. But still, if we did student body right, focused entirely on Naturals and neglected our core, we'd be in a very, very bad place. So, I think we've got -- maybe to the spirit of your question, I think we've got a much better balance today than we've had historically. I feel good about that. But, it's the right question to keep focusing on. Steve, as relates to shaving, first of all, on a global basis from a market share standpoint, we're about flat versus the prior period. So, there's some element of market that continues to impact the segment. As category leaders, we have a responsibility to address that which we're working to do. I think you're looking at it the right way in terms of pacing over a little bit longer period of time, call it the first half. And I do think the first half in aggregate is representative of what the year should look like. We have very strong innovation in the back half of the year with SkinGuard being launched in both North America and Europe. We have some exciting news on the female side of the shop as well. And we continue to make progress from a user standpoint on Gillette Shave Club. So, the first half run rate I do think is indicative of what we should be attempting to deliver over the year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : Hey, Jon. So, my question\u2019s around the pricing environment. First, pricing accelerated sequentially for two straight quarters at the corporate level. Would you anticipate more progress sequentially in the back half of the year versus Q2 in terms of year-over-year pricing? And then, second, in the U.S., wanted to get an update on how the price increases are going so far, both in terms of retailer receptivity and consumer demand elasticity as well as the competitive response you're seeing in the marketplace? Jon Moeller : Thanks, Dara. I would expect on a mathematical basis pricing to be slightly stronger driver going forward, simply because we'll have a full quarter of those prices in effect in both the second -- well, most of them in the third quarter and then certainly in the fourth quarter, or as even in the quarter we just completed. Take for example a pricing for devaluation of developing markets. There wasn't a full quarter in all markets, so that pricing reflected in our results. So, it's not a statement in terms of increasing price component of top-line; it's not a statement of intent, simply mathematical expectation. And then, in terms of how that pricing is going, I apologize for this answer, but it really is too early to tell. Typically, it takes six, even nine months to understand exactly what's going to happen from a competitive standpoint. And we're just getting to the point on some of the initial price increases where we'll be able to understand the full retail response to both our pricing and competitive pricing, both of which have an impact obviously on our result. So, we're going to have to stay tuned on that one. Having said that, I would offer in broad terms that we have not seen anything definitive that would cause us to have a high level of concern. And I'd make that statement again on an aggregate basis. Across individual products and segments, categories and markets, there are always issues, but in aggregate, we're on track. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Nik Modi : Yes, thanks. Good morning. Just two quick questions. Jon, maybe you can talk about where the organic sales growth kind of over-delivered versus you're going in expectations, just to kind of get a sense of businesses that are seeing momentum faster than you had expected? And then, the second question is, I was hoping to get an update on some of the innovations that Procter has created that will be licensed out to other industries. I think you talked about that -- the plastic recycling innovation at the Analyst Day. So, just curious kind of where you are with that particular initiative. Thanks. Jon Moeller : Thanks, Nik. Really the outperformance versus our going-in expectations was broad-based and you see that when you look at the segment results. Very strong across the businesses with Grooming more or less in line with where we expected, so with that exception, each outperforming. And that's true generally as well at a market level, particularly when we look at the first half of the year and the results across that first half. So, I think that's very encouraging. The improvement stool here is not one legged, it's not yet three legged either; it's not one legged.  In terms of -- I'm glad you mentioned the monetization effort relative to our innovation that can benefit multiple categories and industries. I'm very excited about that as an opportunity to both create value -- really three things, to create value; to create fuel for even more P&G innovation, which is incredibly important; and to make an even broader difference in important areas like sustainability across multiple industries and for the benefit of a wide range of constituents. So, that is a -- when we talk about constructive disruption and changing our approach to doing business and thinking about new ways to create value for all the constituents we serve, that's a program I feel very, very good about. And we'll talk more about -- we'll provide some more color to that when we're at CAGNY together in three or four weeks. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Olivia Tong : In terms of the organic sales growth outlook, I\u2019d like some additional color on what gets you from one end of the range to other, because obviously the first half trends were clearly very encouraging, but you get the low end of the range. So, a couple of things. First, where do you think retail inventory stands now? Is there any concern around forward buying ahead of the price increases, particularly in emerging markets? And was there something -- anything significant in terms of promo timings. And just trying to better understand, if you could break those particular buckets out a little bit? And then, just secondly, if you could parse out the price contributions [Technical Difficulty]? Thank you. Jon Moeller : I would really look at the first half top-line results Olivia as clean, if you will. If you look at -- if we look at consumption levels relative to our shipment and sales levels and triangulate with market share, everything is in line. We don't see any significant -- of course, again, at the detailed level, there is always some variability but on average level, we don't see any significant inventory distortions or promotion distortions. Again, at the category level, there can be some differences there. But generally, we look at the first half run rate as representative of the business. And we wouldn't have taken up the top end of the guidance range had we felt otherwise. And then, we come back to what I was talking about earlier, which is just significant volatility that exists. I mean, you've seen some of the competitive statements between Henkel yesterday and KC today. Who knows what the trade situation is going to present to us. What it\u2019s going to be and what that's going to present to us in terms of not so much tariffs, though that is an impact. But the ability to, frankly, import and export products really across markets, that has an impact on our sales. Another big driver of uncertainty is the pricing that we're taking and the impact that that has on market. So, I mean, to give you a sense, if you think about markets like Turkey, Argentina, some of the more pronounced devaluations, we're talking about 30% to 50% to 70% price increases. And those are kind of unprecedented, and they have a big impact -- they can have a big impact on market consumption. And depending on how competitors respond, they can have a big impact on market share. So, we're simply trying to be responsible in the breadth of our guidance range to reflect the range of outcomes that we see as possible. And as I mentioned earlier, there's a -- we're just not at a point -- if we had every business growing slightly above the market, I think we\u2019d be much more confident in bringing up the lower end of the range as well. I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we\u2019re not there yet in either Baby or Grooming, which are two large businesses. So, again, our change in guidance range is a positive one, it's built on confidence but also informed by open-eyed objectivity in terms of the difficult deal environment that we face. In terms of pricing -- kind of price mix across developing and developed, as you'd expect, given the devaluation levels of developing market currencies, pricing level is higher there. The combination of price mix is call it 5% to 8% kind of range. In developed markets, it\u2019s more even with price positive and mix a slight negative, given for example, the relative performance of Gillette versus some of the other businesses. So, no different pattern than I think you'd expect to see. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Thanks. Good morning. Jon, I was curious, if you could talk a little bit about enterprise markets and the organizational structural changes, and you shared this to the Street now couple weeks back. If you could just give us a little bit of color on sort of practical steps that are underway for changing operating structure of those businesses? And also, if going forward you'll be willing to talk about kind of growth rates you are seeing for enterprise markets versus focus markets? And I guess even this current quarter, what growth looks like for the U.S., what looks like for developed markets in total and then developed non-U.S.? Jon Moeller : Okay. A lot in there, Lauren, which I will try to deal effectively with. As you mentioned, you used the word weeks, which is the appropriate word to use of the time spent since we first started talking about the new structure, and we've been working hard since then to bring that to life. As we indicated, we want to go into next fiscal year, July 1st with that structure fully alive. And, we spent a fair amount of time defining what the -- what role each organization is going to play. And I want to be clear that there's -- the design intent here is to drive global categories but approach that growth opportunity in two different ways, one in large and largely developed markets and another that we think will be more effective in the enterprise markets. But, it's not -- the enterprise markets, I expect will -- not expect, I know their strategies will be driven by the global strategies of the categories, our supply chains will be global, managed by the global categories. Our pricing strategies will be informed by global pricing categories. And really the enterprise markets job becomes maximizing the opportunity given those parameters on a daily basis, making decisions real time in the markets without having to do a lot of internal transaction processing to get decisions made. And we'll be clear about that as we get closer to implementation. But I think it really holds promise. When you operate everything one way, by definition, you play to the least common denominator everywhere. And we want to move off of that and we think this is a much stronger approach. We are not going to change our segment reporting but we will continue to give color on what's happening in important markets whether they\u2019re enterprise markets or focused markets, just as we have today. And in terms of the growth rates for the quarter we just completed, if we look at developed markets, classically defined organic sales growth was 2%, there's some variability within that, I mentioned Japan at 9%, the U.S. was a little less than 2%, developing markets growing in the last quarter at 7%. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you. Good morning and congrats on the quarter. So, Jon, I wanted to go back to the pricing but layer it with the A&P spend. You had about 200 basis points benefits on price mix on the top line but about 50 basis points gross margin benefit. So, is that a result of the change in accounting for promotions or increasing support to the brands as you introduced the price increase and that gap should narrow going forward to your benefit? And if I can squeeze in a second question on the China diapers, can you update us on what happened this quarter? So from the declining volumes in the previous quarter due to pricing, did it normalize, and what should we expect going forward? Thank you. Jon Moeller : Let me handle the second one first. We had a difficult quarter in China in the first quarter as you alluded to with sales down double digits. The quarter that we just completed, sales were up double digits, up about 12%. We performed very well in the two major online events in the quarter, which were our 11/11 and 12/12, becoming the number one diaper brand on both JD and Alibaba. The premium part of our business there continues to do extremely well, about a 280 index versus year ago; that's taped and pants. And that's encouraging because that's the fastest growing part of the market. Our overall share grew past three months by a little over a point. Again, most of that in the premium segment of the business, up about 3 points overall, up about 5 points online. We do continue to experience significant softness on the mainline taped business, which is down about 25%, and we did lose a little bit of value share there. But, that shift largely reflects market shifts in terms of preference for premium offerings. You can look -- the obvious question, as you look at those two quarters is, which one is -- which one represents the future. And we're fairly confident about back half growth in China; we\u2019ve got a very strong program with Chinese New Year and strong innovation plans. I apologize on your first question, which is why I went to your second question first. I'm not quite sure what you're asking, but I am happy to talk to you later in the day, or you can talk to John, and it's my shortcoming for not catching it at all. But, relative to mix, the fastest growing portion of our business is -- was just indicated in the discussion, on Baby Care and also in the discussion we had earlier on Fabric Care, has tended over the more recent periods of time to be driven by the premium part of the portfolio. And what I think sometimes gets misunderstood is that doesn't necessarily mean the higher margin part of the portfolio. So, take laundry as an example. If you assume just for a second, and we don't assume this, but assume we have a fixed number of loads that are done across the world every year, if we can do -- if we can receive more revenue for each one of those loads and generate more profit for our shareowners on each one of those loads, I don't care a whole lot about margin. We've -- we're creating value. And so, what you see in some of those premium offerings is higher per unit, per use profit, albeit at a slightly lower margin. And as those items grow faster than the balance of the portfolio, you see that reflected in margin mix, for instance, on the gross margin line. I'm not sure that's what you were asking, but that's one of the drivers and at least the gross margin mix currently. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Strycula with UBS. Steve Strycula : So, given your recent success in a lot of market share gains, particularly in the United States and private label also gaining share, how are the retailer conversations evolving as planograms are getting reset? Is there a difference in the category assortment conversation, meaning that Procter continues to consolidate number one, and number two and number three brands get displayed? How does this also shape their outlook for the ability to lean in for store-brand offerings? Thank you. Jon Moeller : As you can imagine, an aggregate level answer to that question is not terribly relevant, it's very different across categories and across retail partners. I mentioned, first of all, just from a premise standpoint, the private label growth, that's occurring largely in 3 of our 10 categories. And even the level of private label market share that exists is very different across the categories from relatively well-developed to almost non-existent. So, the conversations are different and varied. Having said that, a couple generalities that I would draw. I can't imagine -- well, at least in my experience, which is somewhat limited in this regard. But, I can't recall a conversation with a retail partner that wasn't interested in category growing, category driving premium price items. They're very interested in that as a quickest way for them to grow their market basket and their organic sales line and do it in a sustainable, constructive fashion. I think there continues to be room, just given the diversity of consumers for both types of offerings and most retail outlets. I don't see this being an either or type of game. I do think the point that you made about market leaders and drivers of market growth; and items on the other end of the portfolio is kind of bipolar, if you will, growth strategy is in play at some retail customers. And as a result, I think the least attractive place to be right now is in the middle. And that relates both to performance and price. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Bonnie Herzog : Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to circle back with the question on your guidance. And while you raised your top-line, you did maintain your EPS growth and you called out a few headwinds that will impact your bottom line. But, could you talk further about the cost of growth as you see it and then your expectation for this going forward? And then, in other words, is it a fair statement that in this environment it's simply costing you more to generate faster growth? Jon Moeller : I don't necessarily -- I understand the nature of the question and I have an appreciation for it. I wouldn't say though that broadly that's the case. If you look at the quarter we just completed, our growth was among the highest of recent quarters. That's now true for two quarters. And if I look, for example at our marketing spending as a percentage of sales, because of all the productivity initiatives that I described earlier, that number -- while we have a stronger marketing program than we've ever had with higher reach that we're investing in as we reduce access to frequency, reduce agency and production costs, et cetera, so very strong advertising program, it's not costing us more per, if you will, dollar of revenue gained. Also, I know there was a lot of concern and justifiably so, a couple of quarters ago across the industry relative to promotion levels, and those have generally are come down, both in our case and in the case of competitors, which you would expect as you are generally in a cycle of price increases. So, the data that I have while I'm sure I could make a use case to support your point, broadly doesn't seem to be representative of the world that we face. Now, I do think the premium that\u2019s placed on excellence of execution has increased. There's no room for anything other than excellence, which is why we continue to bang the drum internally and externally on superiority but I don't -- if you do that well, there continues to be a strong appeal as witnessed again by the faster growth and some of the premium priced items within the portfolio. So, I don't think in aggregate, we're in a place where the cost of growth has to be higher. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Bill Chappell : Thanks. Good morning. Jon, just coming back to Grooming, we're about to hit the two-year anniversary of the price cuts in the U.S. on the systems. And so, I'm trying to understand with where you stand now with seeing still some organic growth declines with kind of market share being relatively flat. As you look back, was that a good idea, is it something you would have repeated? And does it say something about the category that having to do that kind of cuts two years later still keeps you just status quo that the category really has more challenges beyond price that you're facing? Jon Moeller : If you look at the first half growth rates in Grooming, the business is essentially flat versus a year ago with much better volume share and value share trends than was the case prior to the pricing. So, we've basically stabilized the share position on the business, which is important. Which leads you to your second question, which is the right question, and there is a lot that's impacting the categories that's outside of that pricing dynamic. And the biggest impact is the societal impacts in the incidence of shaving, both in -- both here and in Europe. The good news is, the market decline across manufacturers that's occurred as a result of that is waning. So, the drag on a quarter-by-quarter basis is lessening. The good news is, as I mentioned that our share positions are stabilizing and strengthening. And that's why relative to an earlier question, we talked about a reasonably strong business in the back half of the year. Big innovations come in as well with SkinGuard, both here and in Europe. So, I called out that business as one that requires more attention and more effort to fully turn. That remains the case. Looking back in one person's judgment, were we wrong and taking that pricing? Absolutely not. And has it been effective in terms of stabilizing our share position? Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from Joe Altobello with Raymond James. Joe Altobello : Thanks. Hey, guys, good morning. Since we\u2019re talking about Grooming, I guess I'll start there. First, was weakness that you saw in response to the emerging market pricing this quarter worse than you expected or in line? And secondly what was U.S. organic growth in the quarter? And I think you mentioned the U.S. market growth was below 2%. So, what did market share trends look like versus the 40 basis-point gain you saw last quarter? Thanks. Jon Moeller : So, I'm not sure Joe that I can give you precise answers across all of your questions on the call but you can follow up with John and get the specifics. Generally though, the trends were difficult in the U.S. with the first full quarter of the Harry's expansion et cetera, and better in other parts of the world. And John can give you a further breakdown of that. Operator : Next, we'll go to Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI. Robert Ottenstein : Great. Thank you very much. In past quarters you've talked about the disproportionate market share gains that you're getting in e-commerce. And I'm wondering, and you talked a little bit I guess about that in China diapers. I\u2019m wondering if you could give us a little bit more details on how you're doing in e-commerce in the U.S. and China by category, and how that's playing out in terms of share? Thank you. Jon Moeller : Generally doing very well in e-commerce, 30% growth last quarter, now approaching about 8% of our business. We're finding success across e-tail customers. And across categories, obviously there's a degree of variability there. But, I think the general message and the takeaway is broadly successful. We don't take that for granted for a nanosecond. It's a very fast-growing part of the business that we're constantly adapting our offerings to serve. And that's everything from the way that offering is communicated to a consumer, to the size of the package, to the ability of the package to survive the journey to a consumer's home and our relevance to the individual e-tail partners, but broadly, very successful. Operator : Next, we'll go to Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge. Jonathan Feeney : Two questions real quick. First, picking up on a comment you made in the very opening statements. You mentioned that the highest margin competitors you have, I think Reckitt, Colgate you called out, cited their exposure to health care as the reason for the segment to the higher margin? Is that true of your own segments and does that tell us something about the maybe the direction? What kind of dynamics are present that maybe are present in your health care portfolio or elsewhere that maybe are instructive for your direction? And second question is, oil is down 35% in the quarter -- end of your last fiscal quarter into this fiscal quarter that you just reported, historically that's been a reasonable indicator of prospective costs. Can you give me a couple of big clouds for why that might not be the case of this time? Thanks. Jon Moeller : Consumer health care margins, to your first question, are generally very attractive. We find that to be an attractive business. It's both a business that has historically grown at very attractive rates and it's done so at very high margins, relatively high margins. And that does explain part of our interest in that category and does explain some of the actions we've taken to increase our presence in that category. And I've been talking for a long time, when asked about where we're interested in adding to our portfolio, I've typically mentioned OTC health Care and Skin and Personal Care as areas that we have both the freedom from a category concentration standpoints and generally the financial attractiveness to at least responsibly explore opportunities to add to our portfolio in those categories. And I would not expect that to -- that should continue. In terms of the question -- your question on oil price, two quick points to make there. One is, and I know this wasn't your question, but just for clarity, given the opportunity. About 1% of our commodity exposure is kind of directly oil; about 5% of our commodity exposure is highly correlated to oil in relatively short periods of time. There's another big chunk of our commodity exposure that is to the petro complex, but that is not highly correlated in short periods of time to the price movements of oil, it's more driven by demand and supply dynamics within those individual supply chains. Typically, the bleed through effects, if you will take 6 to 9 months, which is why in this update you don't see us making big changes, because within the forecast period we're talking about, which is the next five months, but we're not expecting big changes. But, clearly, to the extent that those prices stay low, we would expect some bleed through to our commodity costs over time, obviously things like pulp are unaffected by that as are some of the other materials. I know this wasn't part of your question either, but for completeness, lower oil though is not necessarily a net positive from a holistic earnings per share standpoint. It will have some impact on commodity costs, as we\u2019ve just discussed, but it also has impacts on consumer confidence and on personal budgets in producing countries. And it can have a significant impact on the ability to purchase products in our categories in those countries. So, you need to be careful as you look at oil, both relative to its direct cause and effect on our commodity structure, but also the impact it has on the demand environment. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark Astrachan : Thanks and good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask you just first, broadly, any change in how you think about category growth on a global basis? And then, depending on I guess the answer to that, are you seeing any increasing distance between your growth or maybe even broadly kind of the haves and have-nots across various categories and geographies? In particular, if you go back to a couple of years ago, local and regional competitors, I think have generally done a better job than they did maybe 10 years ago. Is that gap narrowing between the multinationals and local and regional? If not, is it some of the bigger multinationals are kind of stepping the game and pressuring some of the others? And I say that more on a developing market basis, just given that you\u2019ve had much stronger growth in that business than in developed markets, but feel free to answer kind of how you see it across whatever geographies makes sense. Jon Moeller : Category growth is improving slightly, which is very encouraging. And we see that fairly broadly. We see that in the U.S., we see that in developing markets. So, that has been a positive dynamic and is a recent dynamic. Don't get me wrong. We're not talking about categories moving from a 2.5% growth to 5% growth; we're talking about categories moving from 2.5% to 3% growth on a global basis. But all good, all good. In terms of the near-term competitive environment. The local and regional brands are continuing to perform extremely well from both the growth rates -- primarily from a growth rate standpoint, but also, if we look at who's gaining share, in many cases, they are the share gainers, where we've lost business and lost share that has typically been -- and obviously this is a highly general aggregate statement, but has more frequently been to those local and regional competitors than to our global multinational competitors. So, there are clear exceptions to that. So, the gap continues to narrow. That is -- that explains a couple of things in terms of our own strategy. One, again is to redouble our efforts on meaningful obvious superiority and that's not just versus branded manufacturers, that's versus private label manufacturers; that's not just against global competitors, that's against local competitors. And that is extremely important that we maintain a positive position there. The other, as we have made our real effort to distribute resources more in market as opposed to at regional or global headquarters. China is very good example where we\u2019ve been very intentional in doing exactly that for exactly the reasons you cite, being as close to those consumers as we possibly can, being as close to the evolving competitive environment as we possibly can and its\u2019 made a real difference. So, again, we, as you know in the quarter we just completed, are in a share growth position. But we don\u2019t take any of that for granted and are considering the entire competitive set as we calibrate the sufficiency of our efforts. Operator : And your final question comes from the line of Jon Andersen with William Blair. Jon Andersen : Hi, everybody. Thanks for fitting me in, and this is a bit of a follow-on to the last question. Jon, can you give us kind of a broad-based update on the global supply chain work that you\u2019re doing? And the reason that I am asking is, I am wondering whether you\u2019re considering this work more kind of table stakes in terms of serving retailers and channels and end consumers or whether you\u2019re working towards the infrastructure you think can be that can be truly differentiated and kind of a source of competitive advantage, maybe through better unit costs, speed to market, service levels, et cetera? Thanks. Jon Moeller : Good question, Jon. and I would say, the intent is both. Retailers are demanding more in terms of service levels on the part of manufacturers, and we need to restructure and retool ourselves to be superior in delivering against their needs. I do believe that in addition to that -- to those table stakes moves, as you described that we need to make that there are real sources of competitive advantage that we\u2019re creating through our supply chain transformation. A simple aggregation of multiple categories within a site has a huge impact on unit costs, 50% of the cost of manufacturing facilities, the infrastructure of that facility, the roads, the rail spurs, the utilities et cetera. Even more importantly, the service we can provide as a multi-category supplier with full trucks at -- and quantities for each category that work for individual retail partners at very effective costs because we can combine both products that cube out truck and products that weight out of truck, and can deliver those products on a daily basis to our retail partners is a real competitive advantage. I think the ability to, if you will, white paper our processes and manufacturing platforms, I talked about robotics and the digitization that\u2019s recurring at our factories. We will make step function improvements -- exponential improvements versus where we were and I think where most of our competitors, not all but many of our competitors are. So, thanks for raising the question. I think it will serve both. We\u2019re still midstream in our efforts here, so there is more work to do and there are more savings to come. I want to thank everybody for your time this morning. Again, we\u2019re very excited about the first half of our fiscal year and the progress we\u2019ve made, but are not declaring victory, have more work to do to further improve results and are committed to do that. Please take the increase in the topline guidance as indicative of confidence, not fear, but wanting to be very realistic with you about the environment that we see and we operate in. And hopefully we'll continue to make progress. Thanks a lot. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to Procter & Gamble's Quarter-End Conference Call. P&G would like to remind you that today's discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from these projections. Additionally, the Company has posted on it's Investor Relations website, www.pginvestor.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP and other financial measures. Now, I will turn the call over to P&G's Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller. Jon Moeller : Good morning. We'll keep our prepared remarks fairly brief today, reflecting a fairly straightforward quarter and the upcoming Deutsche Bank Conference in Paris. We'll provide result headlines, comment briefly on strategic focus areas and update guidance for the fiscal year before turning to your questions. January-March top line growth was strong with organic sales growing 5%, driven by volume, pricing and mix. 8 of 10 categories grew organic sales; skin and personal care again grew in the teens; Feminine Care and Home Care, high singles; Fabric Care, Family Care, Hair Care, Oral Care and Personal Healthcare each grew mid-single digits. We delivered strong organic sales growth in our two largest markets : the U.S. up 4%, China up 11%. Organic growth was broad-based, equal to or ahead of year ago in 13 of our Top 15 markets with all six geographic regions growing organic sales five up mid-single digits or more. Ecommerce organic sales grew more than 20%. Market share trends remain strong; 33 of our Top 50 country category combinations holding or growing value share of fiscal year to-date, up from 26% last fiscal year, 23% in fiscal '17, and 17% in fiscal '16. Some challenges do remain with Grooming and Baby Care, each down low singles. In total though consumption, volume, sales and shares each progressing nicely. In addition to very strong sales growth, we delivered strong constant currency earnings growth; core earnings per share was $1.06, up 6% versus the prior year, foreign exchange was at $245 million after-tax earnings headwind about $0.09 per share, still on a constant currency basis core earnings per share were up 15%. The effective tax rate for the quarter came in at around 15.5%, due partly to favorable settlement of prior period audits. A portion of this benefit was initially expected in the April to June period. The tax rate also reflects benefits from higher actual tax deductions on stock option exercises versus deferred taxes booked through option vesting. Core gross margin improved sequentially to flat versus year ago despite FX and commodity cost headwinds. On a currency neutral basis, core gross margin increased 60 basis points. SG&A costs and percentage of sales were up versus year ago driven in part by the addition of Merck, including temporary integration cost. For the balance of the company, SG&A as a percentage of sales increased modestly due to increased traditional, digital and social media investments. On a constant currency basis, core operating profit grew 7%. On top of the sales and earnings growth, cash flow remains strong with free cash flow productivity of 100%. $3.1 billion of cash was returned to share owners, approximately $1.3 billion of share repurchased and $1.9 billion of dividends. We announced a 4% increase in the dividend earlier this month, the 63rd consecutive annual increase and 129th consecutive year in which P&G has paid a dividend. P&G is one of only 10 U.S. companies to pay a dividend for more than 120 consecutive years. Only three U.S. companies have increased dividends more consecutive years than P&G. Over the last 10 years, the annual dividend has increased from $1.64 to $2.90 per share, returning $67 billion of cash dividends to shareholders over those 10 years. In summary, a strong quarter, solid consumption, volume and organic sales growth driving positive market share trends across categories and geographies. Strong constant currency core earnings per share growth, a continued best-in-class track record of cash return to share owners. All of these delivered while working to address some significant category-specific challenges and against a difficult competitive and macro landscape. We continue to accelerate change in our program of constructive disruption to meet the challenges we still face and to further improve results from here. As you know, we've made several important strategic choices which are enabling the progress we're making; one was to focus and strengthen our portfolio in daily use categories where performance drives brand choice. In categories where we occupy a number one or two position, which have historically grown faster than the balance of the company and are more profitable, this choice is clearly paying out. Within these categories, again, categories where performance drives brand choice, we've taken a deliberate step to invest in and advance the superiority of our products and packages, retail execution, marketing and value, growing the markets in which we compete and strengthening the long-term health and competitiveness of our brands. We used to spend a lot of time together discussing these advances in the U.S. and China, but they're global in nature. Let's take a look at a few examples in Europe where we have built P&G aggregate share by 20, 30 and 50 basis points over the last 12, 6 and 3 month periods respectively. In Europe, our growth in fabric care is driving category growth of 4%, led by the strength of consumer-preferred products such as Ariel and PODS. Ariel superiority has delivered nearly a point of share growth in Europe Fabric Care against very favorable local competition offering consumers superior performance and convenience. Fairy auto-dishwashing is driving mid-single-digit category growth behind superior premium price innovation, Fairy Platinum. Fairy is delivering double-digit organic sales growth with share up more than 200 basis points. We just launched a new upgrade, Fairy Platinum Plus in the March quarter. Platinum Plus delivers the outstanding cleaning performance Fairy consumers expect with added anti-dullness technology to keep the finish on dishes looking like new. Early results of Platinum Plus are strong and are further strengthening category growth. In Feminine Care, our super premium innovation Always Infinity is driving western European market growth in the pad segment. And Always Discreet continues to drive market growth in the adult incontinence category. In total, Always Feminine Care share is up over 0.5 point year-to-date as we continue to build and expand our advantages in each superiority vector. European Oral Care is driving market growth and strong organic sales growth, led by high single digit growth of Oral B powered brushes. We recently launched Gillette's SkinGuard Razors in Western Europe. SkinGuard is designed to delight the 70% of men who report skin sensitivity which causes many of them to shave less frequently. By addressing this unmet consumer need with superior performing product, we're creating the opportunity to increase usage, building the category and building share for P&G. After just a few months in market the razor systems category has accelerated to double digit growth in France, Germany and the UK with Gillette growing a few points ahead of the market. We've talked a lot about product and packaging superiority, a little bit less about communication of value and very little about retail execution superiority; a key driver of our accelerated growth results. In the recently published 2018 global advantage monitor report which is an independent retailer assessment of manufacturers across seven key performance areas : strategic alignment, people, category development, consumer marketing, trade and shopper marketing, supply chain, and customer service, P&G ranked number one globally. We earned the highest number of number one country ratings; 12 in total including China, Japan, Mexico, Russia and the U.S., and we ranked number one in all 7 performance areas. Omnichannel results were tabulated for the first time this past year. P&G was identified as the leading manufacturer overall with the number one position in the U.S., China, France and Turkey. P&G was recently recognized by Walmart U.S. as Supplier of the Year in consumables. The first time we've earned this distinction in more than a decade, driven by innovation that grows markets and increases margins and record service levels enabled by our supply chain transformation. We were also named Supplier of the Year by Walmart in Mexico, Japan and China. We've recently earned similar recognitions in the U.S. at Target, CVS and Family Dollar. We appreciate this recognition but what really matters is retailers' improved view of P&G as a partner in joint value creation which earns us stronger distribution, share of shelf, display and feature. While we're making solid progress across the superiority drivers, we're working and investing to continue extending our margin of advantage, which will require additional investments. The need for this investment, the need to offset macro cost headwinds, and the need to drive balanced top and bottom line growth including margin expansion underscores the importance of productivity. We're driving cost savings and efficiency improvement in all facets of our business as a part of our second five-year $10 billion productivity program. We've consistently delivered $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion in annual cost of goods sold savings. We're eliminating substantial ways in the media supply chain, delivering nearly $1 billion of savings and agency fees and ad production cost over the last four years. We see more savings potential in these areas along with more efficiency and effectiveness in media delivery. We're continuing to drive savings in organization cost. Total enrollment including contractor positions is down about 30% since the start of our first productivity program. Through our productivity efforts, P&G has maintained and built it's status as a highly profitable company. Before tax operating margins are among the highest in the industry, behind only record in Colgate whose margins reflect our concentrations in healthcare. We have significant below-the-line advantages, operating with one of the lowest interest expense percentages and one of the lowest tax rates, putting us near the top of the industry in after tax margin -- all ready, highly profitable and aggressively driving more savings. We're driving cost productivity and cash productivity with significant progress in all areas in working capital. Over the past five years, we've reduced receivables by 3 days, cut inventory by 10 days and increased payables by more than 30 days, enabling us to fund capital spending needed to transform our global supply chain while growing our dividend and maintaining an active share repurchase program. Over the last 7 fiscal years, we've averaged nearly 100% adjusted free cash flow productivity, returning an average of over 110% of reported net earnings to share owners through a combination of dividend and share repurchase. We're making organizational structure and closure [ph] changes to better position us to win. We're taking steps to simplify the organization's structure, focus, effort, clarify responsibility, increase accountability. We're supplementing internal talent development with experienced external hiring and are improving category dedication and mastery. We're strengthening compensation in incentive programs to align with the organization's structure changes. We're leading the constructive disruption of our industry, leading innovation processes to improve speed to market, shots on goal and success rates of new products; monetizing internally developed technologies to build value and fund even more innovation investment; disrupting the brand building with digitally enabled one-to-one mass marketing; supply chain transformation enabled by robotic process automation; and leveraging digitization and data analytics to drive greater efficiency and effectiveness of all facets of our operations. These portfolios, superiority, productivity, organization design and constructive disruption agendas are not independent strategies. They're reinforced and importantly build on each other. Together, they position us well on a relative basis within our industry to deal with nurturing challenges from macro headwinds, trade transformation and anticipated competitive response -- another foundation for stronger balance growth and value creation over the short, mid or long term. Moving to guidance, I know we all hate to see it go, but with three strong quarters on the books averaging over 4% organic sales growth, we must regretfully abandon the low 2% end of our organic sales guidance range, increasing our organic sales growth outlook for the year to a solid 4%. We now expect All In sales growth in the range of in-line to up 1% versus last year, reflecting three to four points of negative points of foreign exchange. The net impact of acquisitions and investitures should have a modest positive impact on all end sales. We're maintaining our core earnings per share guidance range of 3% to 8% which translates to a range of 11% to 16% on a constant currency basis. This guidance is based on current market growth rates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates, significant additional currency weakness, commodity cost increases or additional geopolitical disruptions are not anticipated within this guidance range. A little bit of perspective on the core EPS guidance. After three quarters, we're up 4.3%, more than a point below the middle of the fiscal year range. Our outlook for foreign exchange commodities, transportation and tariff impacts are unchanged, remaining at a combined $1.4 billion after tax headwind for the year. We now expect an effective tax rate for the year of 17% to 18%. Factor in higher option exercises, we now expect diluted shares outstanding to decrease by 1% for the fiscal year and Q4 diluted shares to be higher than last year by about 1%. We're increasing our outlook for free cash flow productivity to at least 100%, well above our going and target of 90%. We continue to expect within this CapEx spending the range of 5% to 5.5% of sales. This will be another year of strong cash return to shareholders, we expect to pay over $7 billion in dividends and repurchase approximately $5 billion of shares in fiscal 2019. I noted just a minute ago, this continues a long track record of significant cash generation and cash return to share owners, ultimately the most important and enduring measure of a successful enterprise. Over the last 10 years, P&G has generated more operating profit in cash than 98% of publicly listed companies around the world. Only three companies have returned the higher percentage of cash to share owners. We won't provide specific guidance for the next fiscal year until our next earnings call on July 30, but want to provide a few preview points for your consideration. We're pleased with the top line momentum we've created, but we expect a strong competitive response and obviously the comps will be more difficult next year. Some of the unusual bottom line help we've had this year from the land sale and in tax are unlikely to repeat next year, so these will create tough earnings comparisons. FX commodities and transportation markets remain volatile. Media markets and retail shopping are being transformed. I expect as we sit here today, all of this will lead to fairly wide top and bottom line guidance ranges as we head into next year. To sum up, we delivered our third strong quarter of the year, giving us confidence to raise sales and cash productivity targets. Efforts to extend our margin of competitive superiority to drive productivity savings to fund investments for growth and enhance our industry-leading margins, to simplify our organizational structure and increase accountability to constructively disrupt our industry, our driving improved results, but the external environment presents many challenges. To address these challenges and further strengthen results, we continue to accelerate the pace of change. With that, I'm happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Bonnie Herzog : Good morning, Jon. Clearly, there's a lot going on in your business and the global market. In that context, I guess I have a two-part question on your forward outlook. First, on your FY19 guidance. The momentum you're seeing in your business did prompt you to raise your organic sales growth guidance, but not your EPS and you did maintain the very wide range. You did touch on this, but could you drill down a little further for us on the key puts and takes of that? I guess that would help. And then second, I was hoping to get your thoughts on the top line looking forward. This has really been a key question whether or not you're going to be able to sustain the higher level of organic sales growth over the long term, especially that you're going to start to lap more difficult comps. So I guess I'm trying to get a sense of your confidence level in your ability to deliver and then realistically if you expect shared gains to continue to accelerate, or do you think a more moderate level of top line growth going forward is more realistic? Thanks. Jon Moeller : Thanks, Bonnie. On the current year bottom line, there's just a lot of -- let's just start with fiscal year to date. So we've gone through three quarters, we're at 4.3% as I mentioned in our prepared remarks. With only one quarter to go, that's relevant. Second, there's a lot of variability still in the environment, whether that's foreign exchange, commodities, transportation, geopolitical disruption, competitive response, et cetera, and we think it is even with one quarter to go, a bit misleading to give you a view of a very narrow guidance range. We also have a high degree of variability as you've seen in the current quarter from things like tax and it's not certain at this point that we'll be able to close the land sale in Boston within the fiscal year, so that introduces variability. And last but very importantly, we've talked about and are committed to a level of investment that's needed to continue to advance our margin of superiority and we're not going to let up on that. So where does that put us overall? I think the most probable outcome is mid-single digits, consistent with what we've delivered fiscal year-to-date. We've said the fourth quarter will be a little bit better and we have that land sale gain in the fourth quarter, so maybe slightly above that. Everything goes right and that opens up numbers closer to the top end of the range. A couple of problems and we're probably closer to the bottom end of the range. That's how I view the guidance and why I think it's appropriate that we provided the guidance that we have. You raised your next question, gets really to the sustainability not just to the top line, but at the bottom line both for this year and as we go forward. And remember, in a currency neutral environment, we're talking about core earnings per share number this year that are well into the double digit range -- high double digits on a high end of the range. So the fundamental earnings power that exists behind the top line growth that we've been delivering is significant and should remain significant. And then we'll just have to see what happens to things like currencies and commodities and tariffs. In terms of sustainability of the top line, obviously we increased our guidance range or increased our guidance period to a strong 4%. We do that with confidence of sustainability of the numbers. One of the big questions we've all been wrestling with over the course of this fiscal year has been what happens to pricing and can manufacturer successfully price in this environment? I think we're gaining collectively increased confidence that that should be available to us, done the right way, coupled with innovation in a way that builds the value equation for consumers and customers and you're seeing that play through. You certainly saw that for example in Kimberly's results yesterday. The biggest measure though that we're focused on internally in terms of the sustainability of that top line is superiority and being able to deliver to that day-in, day-out across all five sectors that matter. That is highly dependent on innovation, disruptive innovation that grows categories that inflects market growth rates and if we can continue to do that and frankly expand that successful effort across each of the categories, we should be in very good shape. If we can't in categories where performance drive brand choice will have more difficulty. But our recent success, the progress in the market, even market growth itself which is marginally up versus last time we talked, give us confidence that a higher level of sales growth is deliverable and sustainable. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. Good morning, everyone. This is actually Cody [ph] on for Jason this morning. Two questions. One, at your current rate, it looks like you will not hit the high end of your $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion savings per year which was your target. It seems to be one of the areas that has hold back your margin growth. What is causing the cost savings to come in below your target and how should we think about savings for 4Q '19? Jon Moeller : It's largely timing, so we expect to get close to our original communication on those savings and for example, the Tabler Station plant in West Virginia is just coming online with more categories being produced there and the startup cost and integration cost now being exceeded hopefully by savings. We remain committed to a higher level of cost-to-good sold savings, we view it as deliverable over the next couple of years. We might be a little bit lower and some years a little bit higher. In other years, we don't expect any delta from that representation to be a major driver for margin and the fact in the fourth quarter we expect a positive comparison to year ago on both gross and operating margin. Unidentified Analyst : Just thinking on gross and operating margin. Profitability rate has been a bit disappointing on such high organic sales growth. What's holding back your gross margin expansion in an environment where commodity inflation is easing, you are passing through the price and as I said, organic sales growth has been the strongest it has been in years? And SG&A as a percentage of sales grew much more than we anticipate at this quarter. What drove that? Jon Moeller : A couple of question within that. First of all, gross margin was flat versus year ago, which is a sequential improvement as we had indicated and as I said, next quarter I expect positive gross margin comparison. Overall, the flow through from sales earnings is dramatically impacted as we've talked many times by $1.4 billion of after tax of FX, commodity and transportation hits, as well as the tariffs that have been imposed. And as I indicated, our currency neutrals, just take out one of those headwinds, core earnings per share numbers are well into the double digits and as I mentioned on the call, core operating profit on a constant currency basis will be up 7%. So you just can't look past those big drivers of margin compression and remember, when we're pricing to recover those cost -- because you could say, 'Well, yes, I understand that those cost are in there, but aren't you pricing to recover them?' We're pricing to recover the cost, not to recover the margin. So we typically see margin compression. That's just a function of the math behind that until we get through the cycle of market declines that typically occur with significant pricing and then back to growth. But I'm very confident that margin expansion both gross and operating will be a part of our algorithm going forward. It has to be and we're delivered top third TSR, and we're committed to it. Operator : Next, we'll go to Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Olivia Tong : Great. Thank you. I wanted to talk a little bit about the state of competition because it seems that competitive battles are increasing whether it's in toothpaste against total SF or diapers with Huggies launching something new this summer; laundry, Heinkel\u2019s obviously made a lot of noise we haven't seen in the marketplace. But through all of that, you've accelerated your sales growth, you're also spending more so or at least it seems you called it the hundred basis points of higher marketing spend. So can you talk about what you see going forward? Because obviously those competitive battle seem to be continuing to brew up. Thanks. Jon Moeller : Our industry is a competitive industry, across markets, across decades, and will continue to be. We have a very strong and capable competition and we've indicated that we expect a strong response to our share gains. If we do our job and continue to increase the superiority advantage and if that translates into increased or sustained market growth, we'll be just fine. If we're unable to do that, as I said earlier, we'll have some challenges. It would be very unusual in an industry that's as competitive as ours that we're going to be winning every day versus every competitor in every category, in every country. That has not been our historical experience, it's not our current experience, it won't be our future reality, but where we can win 2/3 of those encounters, we're likely to drive to proportional top and bottom line growth. The other thing that's three very positive developments in the market that are important to understand as we think about the role of competitiveness and competition, one is that again, market growth is inflecting slightly positive which is a very good thing. The second is that pricing is occurring where it needs to occur. That's a very good thing. Third, promotion levels. If you look at certainly U.S. results are down. I'm talking at a category level and they're down meaningfully. They're down 5% below a year ago in terms of percentage of volume that's being sold on promotion. And marketing spending is up. You see that pattern. In our results, you see it in other's results and that\u2019s a fairly - at a very aggregate level, a fairly constructive set of observations or dynamics. Each day is a new day, but as we sit here today, that all looks pretty good. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Steve Powers : I was wondering if you would be able to maybe break out growth in the quarter? Enterprise versus focus markets to the extent you're thinking about the business that way? And more generally, as you've been rolling out and communicating that new business structure over the last six months or so, I'm wondering to just to what extent it may be changing behavior, improving decision-making efficiency or maybe just the way you're planning fiscal '20, just some thoughts and context around how that change is taking shape. And if I could squeeze in, just a cleanup question; I think you had mentioned in SG&A this quarter 140 basis points of inflation and other impacts just including Merck. And I'm just curious as to how much of that is transitory, it's kind of unique to the quarter or is spending inflation and elective spending that will persist over the future? Thanks. David Taylor : Thanks, Steve. The majority of the SG&A increased, not all of it, but the majority is due to the addition of Merck to our consolidated results, and importantly, the reflection of the integration costs. So we're going to go through one-time costs to get to synergies going forward. It will also annualize inclusion of Merck in our results after two more quarters. So I don't expect this to be an ongoing negative, I expect it to be ongoing positive once we get to the full integration and deliver the synergies that we expect to deliver. There is also just for clarity within that SG&A number, a reflection of the accrual that we make for compensation and with the results we're delivering, that number is higher this year than it would have been in prior years; so that's also in there. And Jon can help you kind of tease out the relative components here in terms of magnitude. I think excluding Merck, SG&A would have been up slightly reflecting increases in investment as we've talked about across the vectors of superiority. But again, as we go forward, I would expect operating margin as soon as next quarter to hopefully be a positive comparison versus year ago. And certainly, in our construct next year we'd be anticipating the same. In terms of breaking out growth by enterprise markets and focus markets; I'm honestly not prepared to do that today, we're still going through the work of micro-organization design and rewiring the companies reporting back to them just to accommodate exactly the question that you've asked and we'll be prepared to answer that in the future. But the analog I can give you though it's not precise or completely clean; I mentioned that growth was broad-based -- in the quarter we just completed, we grew 3% in developed markets, 9% in developing markets. I expect both sets of markets focused in enterprise to be sources of growth going forward. For perspective again, if you just look at that developed market number, we grew 4% in the U.S. in the last quarter, we grew 3% in Europe, we grew mid-single digits in Japan; so those are going to be -- when you look at the absolute growth that those markets are delivering it's the majority of our growth. We want to maintain the growth upside that exists in some of the enterprise markets and we certainly want to maintain an optionality on future growth and profitability. So this isn't an either/or dynamic, we are set up differently now in those two different sets of markets to win in each. And we'll be prepared to talk more about how this is manifesting itself in terms of specific plans when we discuss our plans for next year. But generally, we're all pretty excited about the opportunities that this presents and are moving excitedly forward. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JP Morgan. Andrea Teixeira : So Jon, if you can a little bit elaborate more on Merck; so, you're saying like excluding Merck EBITs would have been slightly up. And I understand your commentary about the fact that once the synergies are coming through, you expect that to be less of a drag. But just on an apples-to-apples basis, I mean, the EBIT margin for that business is still probably going to cycle the next three quarters being a drag, if you can kind of give us like -- a little bit of a context there? And on the category growth -- I'm sorry, on the commodity cost pressures; I understand some of the $1.4 billion is backward-looking. So if you can give us like a state of the union or how on a sequential basis you're seeing the puts and takes for both, resins and transportation. Thank you. David Taylor : When you look at the quarter, we just completed from a bottom-line standpoint, operating profit, operating margin and all the way through to EPS, I think -- again, the biggest driver is FX. And as I mentioned, you'd have core operating growth on a constant currency basis of 7%. So I think it's important as we talk about what exists going forward and what doesn't to make sure that we have that in our mind's eye as well. The Merck dynamic is largely one of transition costs and I'm not quite sure how those fall by quarter over the next couple of quarters but I would expect us to continue to incur costs to integrate and transition that business. So yes, for the next two quarters until it annualizes and then it will do more than annualized; it will not only annualize, it will improve as we deliver the synergies. From -- and again, Jon can give you more detail there if you need that. From a commodity cost standpoint, we've seen slight easing and parts of the commodity exposure that we have, but not in all. I don't see the commodity environment in terms of our exposures in aggregate being dramatically different than it was when we talked last quarter; maybe a little bit better, but not necessarily a lot. And going forward, in terms of what we see, for example, in the pulp [ph] market, and we certainly don't have a crystal ball in this regard, but if we just look at the combination of demand and supply, there is no real reason to believe that that rolls over dramatically anytime soon. In terms of resins and the petro-complex [ph], your guess is as good as mine. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citi. Wendy Nicholson : Hi, good morning. Can you talk more about grooming, kind of from a high-level perspective because it just seems outside of the big promotion you had in the September quarter, that category has been a weight on your overall results for several years now. And I get it as you say, \"Hey, in a portfolio sometimes things are going to work, sometimes things aren't.\" I get that. But still the consistency of the weakness in the business, despite what we hear about innovation, despite the pricing reset, it just seems so stubborn. So, I guess number one, how committed are you to the category? I mean, you've made big decisions to get out of Duracell, to get out of fragrances. Is grooming something that you really even need to begin over the long run? And number two, it's still, I think your highest margin business at least on a pretax basis. So, is there room to do another major reinvestment, another big price cut or some other reset there to get growth going? Thanks. Jon Moeller : Thanks, Wendy. Let me just start with the Merck [ph] if you will. So, the grooming segment in the last quarter was down 1%. That's minus three in appliances and flat in the watch shave part of the business. So, not where we want to be in terms of growth, but not a disaster by any means. It also is a very different, the results are very different by geography with fairly strong results in Europe, fairly strong results in developing markets and continued market growth challenges primarily as well as some competitive challenges in the U.S. We are investing more right now behind the launch of SkinGuard, which as you know, addresses the 70% of men who feel that they have a sensitive skin and that the shaving experience provides irritation. To the extent that we can address that issue, which we feel SkinGuard does in a delightful way, we have the potential to increase usage, bring man back into the category who have left or increase the shave of frequency because it's no longer uncomfortable. And that's exactly what we're seeing right now in Europe. And I mentioned the system is part of that market and [indiscernible] fluoxetine to 10% market growth since we've introduced SkinGuard and growing slightly ahead of that. We have more work to do in the U.S. and probably do need to invest more to get sufficient awareness and trial, which we're fully prepared to do. So, that's how we're thinking about that business overall. The female part of the business continues to do very, very nicely. We just introduced kind of an exciting exclusive brand with Walmart called Joy, which is off to a great start. This was a business that we not only want to keep it, but that we like and feel we can win in long-term. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark Astrachan : Thanks, and morning, everybody. I wanted to re-ask a question around pricing and volume related impact. Maybe not specific to you but overall the level of pricing seems to be having some impact on volumes from, I guess, from an overall standpoint, more probably developed versus developing markets. Probably a few more, almost entirely that way. I guess I'm curious whether you're seeing things within your categories. And I wanted to re-ask also the question on competitive response and kind of think about it may be in a different way, have you seen anything that's changed on a category basis? We obviously see increasing threats but so far doesn't seem to be that the overall level of increase has gone higher. And then just lastly, kind of related to it. So if inputs have, I don't know, peek through or just at a high level but maybe not going much higher, how have the discussions gone from a retailer standpoint seeing that a lot of them are still eating these price increases and what would your expectations be kind of going forward, whether you can sustain or retain that level of pricing? Or do you have to do more from a promotional standpoint? So, you kind of said that the level of promotional activity is low, so does that increase kind of as we look out over the longer term? Jon Moeller : Yes. If we look at the overall equation on an aggregate basis as relates to pricing, we're relatively optimistic. I see the volume dynamic slightly different than you may see it. We have had significant volume declines and particularly developing markets as we've made major increases places like Argentina and places like Turkey, where market size has been negatively impacted. If I look quarter-to-quarter, so when we've talked last time to our conversation today, I feel more positive about the pricing environment than I did when we talked last. And in part that's because of some moves have been made by significant competitors and you'll see that reflected in their results. I don't know, but I think what you're going to see broadly, and I'm just reflecting on the level of market growth, which has inflected a little bit, it's pretty good top line performance from the HPC industry in this quarter and there will always be a small impact on volume as we adjust prices appropriately. But again, I feel fairly comfortable about where we stand currently.  Our conversations with our retail partners are primarily based on joint value creation on market growth and our margin. The only way they make progress is through market growth. Our shared growth is not that meaningful for them. They want the market to grow and they want our items to generate an appropriate margin for them. And in that context, the pricing dynamic is actually a positive, not a negative. More importantly, we try to take pricing in very smart ways, specifically combining pricing with innovation. With the value equation we're offering consumer's increases. It doesn't decrease. And ideally, the value equation that we're offering our retail partners increases both in terms of the market growth potential and in terms of the margin and that's where we focus our conversations. Operator : Next, we'll go to Nik Modi with RBC. Nik Modi : Good morning, everyone. Jon, I was hoping you can give an update on DS3. I know obviously it's a pretty small initiative at this point, but it does kind of align with the whole disruptive nature of how you're thinking about R&D. What are the early learning and are you going to put P&G brands on it and is it going to be own brand? Any kind of context you can give would be interesting. Jon Moeller : We're very excited about the DS3 and its potential across a number of our categories from a consumer delight standpoint, from a product efficacy standpoint, from the degrees of innovation. It opens up to us in terms of how we can formulate that product and what we can include with it or put in it. But it is very early days and we are working in transactional environments with consumers today across several categories to understand how we can optimize the potential of this very exciting innovation. And that includes work to understand how it can best be positioned from a branding standpoint. So, all of that is work underway, Nik and we'll share more as we learn more and decide more. But this is just a wonderful opportunity that allow us a superior forum and multiple different categories, potentially the creation of some new jobs to do as well. So, we're very, very excited about it and thanks for asking about it. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Steve Strycula with UBS. Steve Strycula : Hi, good morning. A super quick question on Merck as a follow-up. Just, Jon, I just want to clarify that the integration costs were in fact part of the SG&A expenses quarter. Is that in fact the case? Jon Moeller : That's, in fact, the case. Correct. Steve Strycula : And then switching over to Baby Care and Gillette, I noticed in the release this morning, it appears that Baby Care trends to sell already quarter-on-quarter slightly and you called out competition. I just wanting to know whether this was primarily U.S. versus China and how you see both of those markets moving forward. And then lastly, to an earlier question, how do you think about the inflection point for Gillette as SkinGuard gains traction you're advertising? Thank you. Jon Moeller : I'll focus on Baby since we haven't discussed that much during the call so far. Market share trends in Baby are actually improving and sequentially, past 12, past 6, past 3 months on a global basis. So, that's very encouraging. We did see a reduction in the rate of growth in China, but still growing share overall. And that's really the story on Baby with a lot of innovation to come. So, importantly, and I want to be a little bit careful here from a competitive sensitivity standpoint, but to ensure that our as much as possible, our entire portfolio offers a superior experience for consumers, again, across the pricing ladder and form offerings. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj : Hi, guys. So, to help answer the sustainability of top line question, would it be possible to desegregate the drivers of the 5% top line growth a little bit differently than you typically do? And I get the precise numbers might be hard, but sort of in terms of lift [ph] price change, lower trade spend or promo, same-store sales like all else equal same-store sales and then shelf space. Understanding those dynamics might be helpful for all of us to then be able to think about which one of those dynamics are sustainable going forward. And if you can in that talk a little bit about the Argentina price health that you and all your peers, it's not just you but all your peers are getting as well and how that figures into your numbers would be helpful. Thanks. Jon Moeller : Argentina pricing, I think had about a 20 to 30 basis point, in fact, on our overall aggregate top line. So, positive but not a huge driver. As you can appreciate, Ali, sitting here right now, I don't have the ability to break down the numbers in the way that you've been asking for, but let me make a couple of comments. One is if you look at our traditional breakdown, all components are driving top line growth, volume, pricing mix. That's a much more sustainable equation as I think you'll readily appreciate than when you have only one of those or only two of those driving the top line. So that itself speaks to sustainability of the model. And within that price was two points in the quarter. Volume was a positive impact. Price was a positive impact. The second thing, you mentioned shelf space. And we spent some time this quarter intentionally talking about our go-to-market execution and it's importance in this turnaround, and in the sustainability of the top line going forward. And it's very important and we are seeing increased distribution, both in terms of accounts but also in terms of shelf space. We are seeing significant cooperation from our retail partners, again in the spirit of joint value creation and are seeing them viewing us as a source of that potentially more potently than has been the case in recent history. So we're very positive about the progress we're making with the retail trade, be that online or offline, and that speaks to the sustainability of results. I will try to get you more perspective overtime along the lines you've asked, but as I said, you can appreciate I don't have that readily available here. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge Research. Jonathan Feeney : I wanted to understand maybe bigger picture about how discretionary marketing investments work. It seems to me, both from the 100 basis points relative increase in marketing you called out -- all about the over performance on tax rate and coincident with that that there is a level of discretionary investment here and I can understand why that would be. What I'm trying to tell you is how practically that works, so they are like lists of spending people want-to-do and when the environment there so justifies, you or your people in your suite kind of are able to approve that or on a rolling basis; I'm trying to understand what the marginal -- how you think about marginal ROI when opportunities to invest you come up like this and clearly, the driving from top line right now should we expect that to continue to be the case going forward. Just that kind of discipline and process I'd love some insight on. Thank you. Jon Moeller : Majority of those decisions are made by individual category Presidents and Group Presidents who have the clearest view to the opportunities that exists and the return that can be generated on those opportunities. And typically, only if they find themselves in a bind as related to delivering their bottom-line objectives where they come to David and I and ask for an essence of view of the corporate degrees of flexibility that would facilitate investment; that's point one. Point two, where we find smart opportunities to invest, we are going to invest. And I try to make that clear even in articulating the maintenance of our guidance range on a bottom-line for the fiscal year. We really believe that in these categories where performance drives brand choice, we need to be superior across all five vectors of superiority and we're very determined to deliver that. And that doesn't mean that we're going to do stupid things, we're very focused on return but we know that superiority delivers return in these categories, and in the categories where we've truly been able to bring that to market across the portfolio, the results have been really terrific; not just in terms of our own business but in terms of the inflection of market growth rates and the acceleration of market growth rates. So I'm not sure that gives you the granularity that you're looking for but again, the vast, vast majority of decisions where and how to invest are made by individual categories and individual markets, and they're held within that to deliver a bottom-line objective and an overall value creation objective. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Bill Chappell : Jon, just going back to Baby; I mean how comfortable are you that Baby can turn in light of kind of unfavorable demographics for the foreseeable future? And I'm just trying to understand, you know, if the birth rate continues to decline, both at U.S. and around the world, I mean how do you grow that business and is that reasonable to expect it to grow in the next couple of years? Jon Moeller : On a global basis, we expect population to increase; the number of babies born each year to increase. So, again on a global basis, as this is witnessed by current market growth rates, this should be a very attractive category. The other encouraging aspect Bill is that what is growing the fastest within the Baby Care category are the pants form -- particularly, premium pants and premium Type A diapers. So I don't want to make an absolute statement or an overgeneralization, but generally, the category is mixing up, not in every case but in an aggregate. China is a clear example of that, and generally, smaller families contribute to that dynamic. The preciousness of one child versus the family I grew up in of eight children generates a very different purchase dynamic. So there is nothing that we see that causes us concern that this is a category that's going to be declining. There are certain markets that will present challenges and we need to make sure as I said earlier that we're superior across each points of the pricing ladder that people choose to enter the category in or move to. And if we do that, this should be a very, very attractive business. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy with Macquarie. Caroline Levy : Just wanted to ask within Beauty; your top line looked strong and I would have expected stronger EBIT growth driving that. And then in contrast in Fabric Care, you had really, really strong profit growth; can you just talk to some of the drivers of -- what happened to margins in each of those respective businesses, Beauty and Fabric? David Taylor : Once we get below the top and bottom lines on an individual category basis, I'm a little bit ill-equipped to give you the quality of answer that I think you deserve. So I'm going to ask you to follow-up with Jon on that. Clearly in Fabric Care, we've dialed back significantly on promotion levels which has had a big impact on profitability. In both categories we have productivity savings coming into effect, we're investing pretty heavily in the Beauty business to drive that top line and that's responding very nicely. I'm comfortable overall with the combination of top and bottom-line growth rates in both of those businesses but Jon can provide you a little bit more granularity. Operator : Our next question comes on the line of Joe Altobello with Raymond James. Joe Altobello : So, first a quick housekeeping item; the gain on the sale of the Gillette site in Boston that you expect in the fourth quarter, that's about $0.04 to $0.05 a share, if my notes are correct, and I think that's going to be in the SG&A line, not another income? Jon Moeller : It's, it's -- I would call the range $0.04 to $0.06, and yes, it will be in SG&A. Joe Altobello : Okay. And then shifting gears to the after-tax headwinds from FX, commodities, currencies; still it looks about a $1.4 billion this year and I know this is a big assumption but if you assume nothing changes what would that number look like for fiscal '20 with commodities getting better at transport rates, at least on the stock market down dramatically year-over-year? Jon Moeller : Yes, it's a hard question to answer believe it or not. I realize it would seem relatively simple but nothing is in the space. You know, if you just look at etcetera payables [ph], so nothing else changes. You've seen the constant currency earnings per share growth numbers I've provided, so you see the significant leverage as we hopefully continually sustainably grow the top line that should lead to improved margins and that constant currency number which is well into double digits still assumes the commodity hit on the tariff hit, so if all of that goes away, we're in a much better place. Now the second question as you'll rightly move to is, what to -- that doesn't just affect P&G, it affects other competitors and what do they do with that savings? And do they spend that back? Do they take it to the bottom-line? How is it spent back? All of that will have an impact on what actually happens from a bottom-line standpoint in the scenario that you described. But clearly, it would be a more -- it's hard to imagine it wouldn't be a more positive scenario and we're hopeful that's the case. Having said that, as we went into last year and this is why you know, I'm kind of anchored to fairly wide ranges because I think it reflects reality, we went into last year and within months had an additional $400 million after-tax and currency impacts alone. And then we had the introduction of the tariffs as we went through the year. So, it's -- I would encourage you to think in ranges. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI. Robert Ottenstein : Great, thank you very much. Two questions if I may. First, just wanted to go back to the operating leverage or lack of leverage in the results and wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about the FX impact and why given the significant way to the U.S. the impact is so much higher on earnings than it is on sales and if there is anything you could do with about that overtime? So that would be the first question. And then second, just a little bit more detail on e-commerce; great overall results, up 20% globally. Could you give us a little bit more detail in terms of how the U.S. did? How China did? And whether you're gaining share or not on e-commerce? Thank you. Jon Moeller : In terms of currency on margin, the impact; if you look at the gross margin as we said in our prepared remarks, it was flat all-in on a core basis versus year ago. Constant currency was plus 60 basis points, so you get an idea of the impact on a gross margin. On operating margin, we were 60 basis points down versus year ago, all-in core, and ex-currency we were 40 basis points up. So, again with that top line result as hopefully currency annualizes and doesn't -- in this scenario where it doesn't continue to devalue there should be significant leverage within the income statement that hasn't existed this year as we've tried to work our way through that. E-commerce; we're doing well on a geographic basis pretty broadly. There are a lot of dynamics within individual retail accounts which drives a fairly high degree of volatility within the result, but if you trend it out beyond -- you know, one quarter, we continue to make really significant progress. We still have a share opportunity, we're growing share in China but our shares at e-commerce are still lower than offline; so that continues to present an opportunity that we're closing that gap quarter-on-quarter. In the U.S. our shares are more representative on the online business of our offline position. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation, you may now disconnect. Have a great day. Jon Moeller : Well, thanks everybody. Again, I think a very strong quarter. I do believe these kind of results or a proximity of them should be sustainable going forward, and we should be able to drive more leverage to the income statement and a more benign effects on environment but very, very positive developments sequentially; so thanks. Thanks for participating.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning and welcome to Procter & Gamble's Quarter End Conference Call. P&G would like to remind you that today's discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from these projections. Also as required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the Company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business trends and has posted on its Investor Relations website www.pginvestor.com a full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Now I will turn the call over to P&G's Vice Chairman, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller. Jon Moeller : Good morning. David Taylor, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer and John Chevalier, Vice President, Investor Relations join me this morning. I'm going to provide an overview of Company results. Dave is going to update us on four strategic focus areas superiority, productivity, constructive disruption and organization and culture. I'll close with guidance for fiscal 2020, and will of course take your questions. For the fiscal year, we just completed organic sales up 5%. Core earnings per share up 7% currency-neutral core earnings per share up 15% adjusted free cash flow of productivity 105%. $12.5 billion of cash return to shareowners. Each of these metrics in line or ahead of objectives set going into the year. GAAP earnings per share are lower, reflecting a one-time non-cash accounting charge to adjust goodwill and intangibles carrying values of the Gillette shaving business. Grooming continues to be a very attractive business, organic sales up year-over-year. April-June sales up 4% a truly global business with strong market positions a highly profitable and cash generative operation. Initial carrying values for Gillette were established nearly 14 years ago in 2005. We significantly over delivered acquisition cost synergy commitments but as outlined in each of our quarterly filings for the past three years, this global business has faced significant an increase in currency impacts over the last decade. Lower shaving frequency has reduced the size of the developed blades and razors market. More recently, and much less of an impact new competitors have entered at prices below the category average. These factors caused us to reduce the accounting and carrying value for this business on our balance sheet. As I mentioned earlier, all core metrics organic sales growth core earnings per share growth, currency neutral core earnings per share growth adjusted free cash flow productivity, cash return to shareowners in line or ahead of objectives set going into the year. All of this progress against strong headwinds. Foreign exchange, commodities, transportation costs and tariffs created a $1.4 billion fiscal year after tax headwind, a 13 point negative impact on core earnings per share. Within this currency had some more than $900 million after-tax. Large markets with significantly weaker currencies. British pound, down 4%, Mexican peso down 4% Chinese yuan down 5%, Russian ruble down 12%, Brazilian real down 18%, Turkish lira down 14%, the Argentinean peso down 97%. Commodity cost increases of $400 million after-tax. Pulp up 14%, resin up 7%, propylene up 10% and kerosene up 16%. Trucking costs up significantly in the U.S. with increases in many additional markets annualized tariff impacts approaching a $100 million. All overcome with innovation-driven volume growth, pricing and productivity, yielding strong results for the year. Happy and a strong year, a very strong April-June quarter organic sales up more than 7%, the four quarters of the fiscal year for 4%, 4%, 5% and 7% on the top-line volume, pricing and mix, each contributing to top-line momentum. Broad based growth in all 10 global categories is growing organic sales. Skin & Personal Care and Personal Healthcare each up mid-teens, Fabric Care and Home Care each up double digits, Oral Care and Feminine Care up high-singles, Family Care and Grooming each up mid single digits. All six geographic regions also growing organic sales. India, Middle East and Africa up mid-teens Greater China up double-digits, North America, Latin America and Asia Pacific up high singles. Europe up mid-singles. Strong organic sales growth in our two largest markets, up over 7% in the U.S. 10 out of 10 categories, growing. Continued progress in China improving from a 5% sales decline in fiscal '16, 1% growth in fiscal '17, 7% organic sales growth last year. Fiscal '19 growth up 10%, up 12% in the April June quarter. Global e-commerce organic sales of 25% now well over $5 billion in annual sales, were about 8% of the Company total. Strong and improving market share trends aggregate global value share up versus year ago 33 of our top 50 category country combinations holding or growing value share in fiscal 2019, up from 26% in fiscal 18%, 23% in fiscal '17 and 17% in fiscal '16. So in chronological order 17%, 23%, 26% and now 33%. 8 of 10 global category is holding our growing share. On the bottom line, core earnings per share of $1.10 up 17% versus the prior year, up 26% on a currency neutral basis. Fourth quarter margins improving both sequentially and versus year ago. Core gross margin up a 120 basis points. Strong top-line leverage and productivity improvement more than offset FX commodity cost and mix headwinds. On a currency neutral basis, core gross margin up a 160 basis points. Core operating margin increased a 130 basis points on a currency neutral basis, up 210 basis points, including 340 basis points of productivity driven cost savings. Cash flow remains strong adjusted free cash flow productivity of 122% for the quarter, 105% for the year. $12.5 billion of cash return to shareowners, a combination of dividends and share repurchase. Our Board increased the dividend by 4% in April the 63 consecutive annual increase in the 129th consecutive year in which P&G has paid a dividend. P&G is one of only 10 U.S. companies to pay a dividend for more than a 120 consecutive years. Only three U.S. companies have increased dividends more consecutive years than Procter & Gamble. Over the last 10 years, the annual dividend has increased from a $1.64 per share to $2.90 per share, up almost 80% returning almost $67 billion of cash to shareowners. Over the last decade, we've returned more than a 100% of net earnings to shareholders as dividends and share repurchase. In summary, we delivered or over delivered on each of our going-in targets, other than GAAP earnings per share. We did this while offsetting a foreign exchange commodities transportation and tariffs tsunami. We built momentum on sales, share and margin as the year progressed. We delivered very strong constant currency core earnings per share growth and continued our best-in-class track record of cash return to shareowners. We still face challenges and continue to operate in a very difficult competitive and macro landscape. Our work is not over, but we're making progress behind the integrated and mutually reinforcing strategies. David will discuss next, David? David Taylor : Thanks Jon. One of the most encouraging points about the strong results we've delivered is the breadth of the progress we've made across the categories and countries. The breadth of growth, gives me confidence that the strategies and focus areas that are guiding our choices and investments to the right ones. It also gives me confidence that we're building the capabilities to sustain the growth at or above market levels. The mutually reinforcing strategic choices, we've made are critical to the progress. We focused and strengthen our portfolio, in daily use categories, where performance drives brand choice. In categories where we occupy a number one or number two position, which have historically grown faster than the balance of the Company and are more profitable. In the benefits of the portfolio choices are clearly paying out within these 10 categories where performance drives brand choice we've taken a deliberate step to invest in and advance the superiority of products and packages brand communication retail execution and value advantage, growing the markets in which we compete, and strengthening the long-term health and competitiveness of our brands. We've raised minimum standards of competitive advantage across each of the superiority drivers and are investing to meet or beat these new standards. And superior offerings drive market growth, and this is one thing that's incredibly important about the plan, increase in consumption, creating additional usage occasions, bringing more spend into a category grows the market. This creates top line growth it is typically more sustainable than simply taking business from a competitor, it creates a winning proposition for our retail partners. The pie expansion versus zero sum. It's a positive versus negative spiral and when where - where we grow markets disproportionately and more sustainably, we build share. We've spoken a lot about the role of product and packaging superiority and growing markets in P&G share but communication go-to-market and value must also win. We start with understanding our consumers and their needs wants and aspirations, we then create advertising that makes you think, talk, laugh, cry, smile, share, and of course buy. Advertising that drives growth for categories and brands. Advertising that clears the highest bar for creative brilliance, sparking conversations, affecting attitudes, changing behavior and sometimes even defining popular culture. This year at the Effie Awards, which recognized the most effective marketing communication P&G won the top honor of most effective marketer and Tide won the Grand Effie Award at the Cannen Lions International Festival of Creativity. P&G advertising earned 16 lions, three gold, six silver and seven bronze, In Effie event we announced the series of innovative new creative partnerships that reinvent advertising by merging the world of advertising with other creative worlds. Such as film making, music, comedy, journalism and technology. Superior in-store and online execution also grows categories in our brands, the right trade coverage with category mastery with the right product forms, sizes and prices and the right in-store or online presence in merchandising execution, delivering against key business drivers for each category and brand across all channels in every store, every day. On the last earnings call and recent conference presentations, Jon is taking you through some of the recognition we received directly through some of our top customers and then third party retailer assessments of manufacturers capabilities. We very much appreciate each of these recognitions, but what really matters is retailers improved view of P&G as a partner in joint value creation, driving superiority to grow categories earned stronger distribution, share shelf, display and feature. The fifth element of superior execution is a winning consumer and customer value equation. For consumers, this means a product that meets an important need and noticeable in superior way with the package that enhances the usage experience with compelling communication presented in a clear and shoppable way at a compelling price. For the customers this means margin penny profit, thrift generation basket size and very importantly category growth. We're going to continue to work to make progress in superiority extending our margin of advantage and increasing the quality of execution, which will require ongoing investment. The need for this investment and the need to offset the macro cost headwinds we talked earlier and the need to drive balanced top and bottom line growth including margin expansion underscores the importance of productivity. We are driving cost savings and efficiency improvement in all facets of the business. Now just past the midpoint of our second five-year $10 billion productivity program. Through our productivity efforts P&G has maintained and built its status as a highly profitable company. In the past, Jon has shown you the charges before and deserves PD. P&G's before tax operating margins are among the highest in the industry, behind only Reckitt and Colgate whose margins reflect their concentrations in healthcare. We have significant below the line advantages operating with one of the lowest interest expense percentages and one of the lowest tax rates, putting us near the top of the industry in after tax margin, already highly profitable and aggressively driving more savings. These results are due to a sustained intense focus on improving productivity across all cost falls and we will continue to focus on this, because it will be a critical driver of our success. Superiority and productivity are critical, but insufficient to keep us ahead in a world with rapidly changing retail environment, quickly evolving consumer needs, media transformation and revolutionary changes in technology. We must and are leading the constructive disruption of our industry across all areas of the value chain. We are disrupting the way we innovate by accelerating the speed and quality of learning through LEAN innovation. This new approach is delivering significant benefits in time and costs, helping to reduce our learning cycles from months to even days. We're monetizing innovation across industries to accelerate investment in R&D and broaden societal impact. We're disrupting retail execution SK-II is using AI supported technologies to enhance the consumer shopping experience with personalized recommendations based on smart scans of a person's skin, product browsing on virtual shelves and shopping through the wave of a hand, it's the first augmented reality retail environment which merges physical and digital technology to give the shopper exactly the skin care regimen needed in new smart packaging that features a companion app for personalized skin care every day. Going beyond broad demographic targets to deliver exactly what she is looking for solutions designed to work for her. We're reinventing brand building from wasteful mass marketing to mass one to one brand building fueled by data and technology. We're moving from generic demographic targets like women ages 18 to 49 to more than 350 precise smart audiences. Like first time moms or millennial young professionals or first time washing machine owners to reach the right people at the right time at the right place. We continue to show up our supply chain with transformation across the globe. In Europe, we've optimized the distribution in manufacturing infrastructure to fewer scaled multi category operations in optimum locations, manufacturing sites are now down 30% and distribution centers are down 35%. We'll make an organization structure and cultural changes to better position us to win. We're taking steps to simplify the organization, focusing effort, clarify responsibility, increase in accountability and structuring compensation and incentive programs to better align with these objectives. We have an incredibly talented organization of more than 90,000 fully committed people they moved mountains for years to deliver the progress we're discussing this morning; they deserve the credit. We have historically put in their way a lot, competing management structures, lack of clear accountability, lack of end-to-end decision making many people who can say no and few who can say yes. On July 1, we moved to new organization structure designed to de-matrix of the company and provide even greater clarity on responsibilities and reporting lines to focus and strengthen leadership accountability. We are operating six industry based sector business units or SBUs. The SBUs have profit and loss responsibility for the largest markets, the focus markets, which represent about 80% of sales and 90% of profit. The SBUs CEOs are focused on winning and driving value creation opportunities in these important markets. We're optimizing the remaining markets which we are calling enterprise markets to accelerate growth in dynamic macro environments. The benefit of this design is the creation of more focused, agile and accountable organization operating at a lower cost focused on winning through superiority fueled by productivity and operating the speed of the market. North America was the pilot region beginning three years ago for the end-to-end SBU approach in China, following a year or so later. The success of this design is evidenced, by the sales and share progress we've made in both of these markets. We are committed to winning everywhere we choose to compete across both the focus and enterprise markets and we want to win the right way. We want to be a force for good and a force for growth. We've integrated citizenship and how we do business, enabling us to have a bigger impact on the people we serve, the communities in which we live and work and the broader world that surrounds us. In turn this helps us grow and build our business. I hope enabling us to have a bigger impact on the people we service the communities in which we live and work in the broader world that surrounds us. In turn this helps us grow and build our business. I hope this is evidence that we have been disrupting P&G. The choices, we've made to focus and strengthen our portfolio in daily use categories where performance drives brand choice to established and extend superiority of our brands to lead constructive disruption across the value chain to make productivity an integral part of our culture, just as much as innovation and to improve the organization, focus agility and accountability. These are not independent strategies they reinforce and build on each other. They position us well within our industry to deal with near term challenges from macro headwinds, trade transformation and anticipated competitive response. And they are the foundation for stronger balanced growth and value creation over the short, mid and long term. Now going to turn it back over to Jon to cover our outlook for fiscal 2020. Jon Moeller : We provided details of our outlook in the press release published this morning, so I'm going to focus on the primary guidance metrics in this call. We expect organic sales growth in the range of 3% to 4% where operating markets - in markets that are currently growing at a rate somewhat above 3% on a value basis. Our guidance range brackets current market growth with a bias toward continued share growth, while still expecting a strong competitive response. The range also implies acceleration of two-year average growth rates moving from 3%, two-year average growth for fiscal years '18 and '19 to more than 4% average organic sales growth across fiscal years '19 and '20 in a market growing somewhat above 3%. On the bottom line, we expect core earnings per share growth of 4% to 9% getting us back to our target, mid-to-high single-digit range. Neither top line or bottom line guidance ranges are layups. Both represent meaningful sequential progress. Innovation-driven market sales and share growth, meaningful gross margin expansion, while investing and product impacted superiority increased investments in media and other demand creation marketing programs. Base period comps that include the Boston land sale, and the gain on the sale of two Oral Care brands in Europe. Fiscal 2020 will continue a long track record of significant cash generation and return to shareholders. Ultimately, the most important and enduring measure of the successful enterprise. We're targeting another year of 90% free cash flow productivity; we expect to pay over $7.5 billion in dividends and repurchase $6 to $8 billion of shares in fiscal 2020. Our guidance is based on current market growth rates, current commodity prices, current foreign exchange rates. Significant currency weakness, commodity cost increases or additional geopolitical disruptions are not anticipated within this guidance range. Now, let me hand it back to David for closing comments. David Taylor : We delivered our fourth strong quarter in a row, continue to build top line momentum and improving the quality of our bottom line results. Market share has been improving for eight consecutive quarters, our efforts to extend our margin of competitive superiority to drive productivity savings to fund investments for growth and enhance our industry leading margins to simplify our organization structure and increase accountability to constructively disrupt our industry are driving improved results. But we know our work isn't finished yet to further strengthen results, we will continue to accelerate the pace of change. The macro environment and strong competition are sure to percent new challenges in the year ahead. But we're better positioned to manage through these challenges that we've been in many years. With that, Jon and I are happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Olivia Tong : You guys have just finished, what is arguably your best here in about a decade. So can you just talk through like sort of order of priority and the changes you made that have led to this the improving innovation and the portfolio changes divestitures, you did a several year ago and how the organizational changes that are now in place help to keep out that's just - help up-- help to keep that up that sustainability? Thanks. David Taylor : The strategy truly is working and we keep reinforcing it but I come back to it. The combination of first, starting with the consumer, making sure we delight the consumer and we do that through superior products packaged communication, go-to-market capability and value is really making a difference and what allows us to sustain and you're seeing this now over three years in more and more category country combinations is an organization design that is putting accountability closest to where the market is in a way that's working and we've clarified responsibilities with focused markets and enterprise markets recognized in - not all markets are exactly alike. And to me what we've seen increasingly each semester, if you will, the organization respond clear priorities, clear strategy on superiority. They understand if internalized and doing a great job on productivity across all cost buckets and we continue to work to clarify the organization design in a way that delivers an engaged, agile and accountable organization and you're seeing that better and better. It was reflected in the employee survey this year where the confidence in the strategy, went up significantly by folks across markets and GBUs, which to me speaks to me an alignment of 90,000 plus people on a plan that's working, and that's why I think you're seeing the sequential progress that we've seen quarter-to-quarter, semester-to-semester, and we really look year-to-year. And so it's very encouraging. Jon Moeller : I would just add a couple of things that David addressed in his prepared remarks. The first is, and it's the thing that gives me the most confidence and sustainability of results is delivering growth by growing markets. And there are many examples the inflection in the rate of the laundry market growth in North America and other markets behind PODS, significant acceleration in the rate of the market growth of fabric enhancers behind things like beads. significant doubling actually of the growth of the adult incontinence market through all was discrete and there are many other examples. But those tend to be much more sustainable and much more profitable than when we're simply taking share from competitors. The second piece just briefly is and David also mentioned, this is the importance of balance. That's the only way you sustain this level of growth and investment and still offer return to shareowners. We need to grow both the top and bottom line the year and the quarter that we just completed our evidence of our ability to do that and we've got a leadership team that's committed to continue that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : I was hoping I would ask a question, looking for some example, tangible examples. Because so much of the brand reinvestment work in portfolio work that we've heard about that you guys have talked about has been very U.S. focused and sometimes sitting here it's a little tough to get a full picture of the P&G world. So if you could talk a little bit about some things that are maybe happening in other focused markets, just an example would be we read last month about this relaunch of oriental therapy skincare in China. Just if you could run through some of the - may be to focus on China some of the portfolio work that you're doing that we may not be that aware of just sitting as we are in the U.S. Thanks. David Taylor : Lauren there are many examples, then we could kind of run around coefficient categories, but I'll just give a few just to sprinkle around the world. Other than the U.S., if I look in Europe where you've seen an acceleration of growth, our dish business and I think auto dish is when we haven't talked a lot about, we've rolled out Platinum across many of the countries, it's, again - it's a trade up. It's a superior proposition and we've seen meaningful share growth across many countries in Europe where auto dish now is one of our faster-growing categories. If we look in China, we've given many examples over the last couple of years. We now have Fem Care growing double-digits. You've got laundry growing and you've got beads and PODS and then you've got just a series of initiatives across almost each country on whatever is the most appropriate for that country. The two of them that I mentioned, are those dishes in Europe and frankly several of them in China. But that's true as well, we almost go to every focus market and there'll be a list of them, but it's hard to list one because each of the 10 categories now has a very specific innovation plan that addresses what it takes to grow the markets and better delight the consumers and even our expansion markets. Our newer brands are also doing well. So it's a broad base support right now. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : So first just a clarification, the Q4 top line result was so strong. I'm wondering, if you included any timing benefit of retailer inventory shifts and if that might impact fiscal Q1 and then you were clear in your prior answers on the internal momentum and what's driving that internal momentum. I was hoping you could give us a bit more detail on the level of risk from an external standpoint. Just as you look at a competitive standpoint on both pricing and marketing reinvestment going forward given a number of your competitors have publicly announced margin resets recently. So, I love a bit more detail on what gives you confidence behind continued market share gains and how you think about that external environment, thanks. Jon Moeller : Dara, I hand your second more important question to David. On the first part, though, we did see small inventory builds and a couple of customers primarily in the U.S. who increase their commit - their service commitments to their customers relative to the number of days or hours that they were going to have products delivered to their - to their shoppers and they built a little bit of inventory to support that. For perspective, though the organic sales growth rate in the fourth quarter, if you exclude that small inventory build would have remained or does remain well over 7%. David Taylor : And the second half on competition, certainly our eyes are wide open and we respect all our competitors and yes, we have followed the many announcements on investments in becoming more competitive and we're aware of the guidance that they publicly offer, what we're trying to do and have continuously been doing though is staying focused on the consumers on market growing innovation, if we maintain superiority when we see innovations come out in the marketplace to ensure there are innovations deliver on meaningful superiority, then I think we're well placed. Part of the reason, we've continued to emphasize the need to generate productivity as we anticipate that we're going to have to invest. It's - we don't know exactly where, how much of what category, but we know that if we can continue to invest meaningful or rather create meaningful buckets of investment opportunity then we're able to remain competitive in the key markets. To date, we've seen a number of innovations come on from our competitors and to date, we've been able to address those with our innovation and where possible, our intent is to provide innovations to grow the category. And then that environment it frankly, doesn't create a destructive market situation. We have shifted our focus over the last several years on market growth and on meaningful superiority across the five elements. We're mindful of and aware of what competition does, but we've made sure we don't get distracted on chasing a specific competitor and or innovation, instead play our game and stick to our strategy and it's working well. Jon Moeller : And there is a concern, the concern that the competitive environment is heating up as a valid one. It's only logical and natural. But what we're seeing so far. Take the U.S., for example volume moving on promotion indexing at 94 in the last quarter, versus year ago. So generally we're in a fairly constructive environment where people are trying to innovate to grow markets and that's the game that we like. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English : I guess I'm going to try to jam into one, a quick follow-on to Daren's question. Your guidance calls for commodities and currencies etc. all kind of be net neutral. So certainly a lot more accommodative than we've been in the past and presumably, this is - this is the same type of environment for our competitors and you overlay the investment, how do we think about category growth and particularly in context of the price trajectory as those dynamics play out. So that's part one, and then part two is still sort of linked to it if commodities, currencies, etc. kind of go net neutral for you and you deliver the productivity ramp you have, it looks like you should have around 260 basis points of margin tailwind from productivity, midpoint in guidance seems to suggest around 80 bps implying that there is over $1 billion of reinvestment is that math roughly right and if, so where do you expect that reinvestment to go to. David Taylor : Jason, I'll take the first part and I'll let Jon address the margin side. First on category growth rates, as Jon mentioned, they've been relatively healthy. And frankly, if we continue to do our job and if competition does innovate in constructive ways then I think the categories remain healthy. And if I look across the world, the U.S., which is our biggest market has been very constructive at 3% or better. Europe, it's been - it's a 2%. Our view going forward, it's probably about 2%, maybe a little bit softer next year. The India and Middle East and Africa areas in mid-to-high single digits, at least mid-single digits. China, there has been a modest slowing down, but still very healthy in our categories we're seeing, call it high-single digits 7, 8s and we haven't seen a major slowdown, just a little bit of softening. Asia Pacific more like two, Latin America has actually been sequentially improving, Brazil sequentially improved a bit from a recession to now modest growth, call it one to two, but that's encouraging versus where it was before. So broadly what we look across the focused markets, the top 10 markets we're seeing constructive growth rates and at least in our categories we bring meaningful innovation. We're seeing a tick up and that's - that the - to be the strength of this strategy is you've got a consumer right now that is interested in our categories, and the innovation that we're delivering is ticking up some of the growth rates. where we have a meaningful share in most of the categories we participate. We do have meaningful share. So that works well. There's very few places, there aren't growing now in our major markets. India, is one I did mention, it's double digits and frankly as we look forward, right now we don't see a reason why it wouldn't stay and in the 10% to - 10% to 12% range. So, with the exception of what I call modest growth in Europe, many markets are growing faster in Europe is very solid and profitable. So we like that region as well. Jon Moeller : And on the income statement question, I think your observations are generally correct in terms of directionality. We should have under current - under the current macro assumptions, the ability to grow margin and to reinvest in maintaining and building our levels of superiority. Also, as you look at the comparisons remember that there are several significant one-time gains in the base period that we have to lap as well, but we are very cognizant as I think, is reflected in the conversation we're having here about the competitive nature of our categories, our need to continue working on superiority, the investment that's required to do that, but still being conscious of the need and I think the ability to grow margin. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Steve Powers : I guess I was hoping maybe you could zero-in and just expand on some of the benefits that you're getting from the focus on the lean innovation initiative that David, I think you talked about in your prepared remarks. Just maybe an example or two, you could share that illustrates the continued progress on that front. And then, I guess what I'm really interested in, is the benefits that you're getting. Is that really measured just in terms of speed to market or is there early evidence that the - that lean innovation can actually lead to improved consumer acceptance of the products that are yielded by that process. David Taylor : Steve, I think the advantage of lean innovation are meaningful across many dimensions. First, there are several examples, we've given in the past. Pampers Pure came to market much, much faster than it would have in the past, because we had a small team dedicated working on it, they fell in love with the problem, they were trying to solve developed the product, the materials, the communication and then went to market, it's done very well. We gave in the past, I think the example of micellar water in China, which was the line extension on Pantene that's now been added to many brands in many other countries. The benefit in seeing one is speed. The second is a number of hypotheses that we can advance in one problem area and what happens then if you find the consumer idea that's more powerful and given the illustration, if you have one hypotheses you do a large space test, you can get a significant break on a 300 base test. You test 10 and have small teams and only give them 20 base size, you have to have a major advantage in order to break significance and we actually like the smaller base size, because you have to have a meaningful advantage to be significant. And what we're getting that out of this is, we're testing more ideas and finding bigger ideas, then we can focus on incubate and then advance and whether it's Pampers Pure or micellar water there's many more to come to market. The last comment I'd make and I think we've released some of this in the consumer electronics show or others the number of transaction learning experiments we are going now which allowing us to learn fast with small teams with relatively small investments. Is at a very high level and that gives me confidence again we're going to find ideas, consumer ideas and business propositions that have great promise with minimal investment. The idea is you want learning to stay ahead of investments and as long as that happens to me, along with the focus on delighting the consumer to me, we're going to see a robust innovation program come out of our 10 categories each of the 10 categories has a growth works effort to make sure they're growing the core first and foremost. But also looking at underserved or fast-growing areas that we can enter and win in. And the lean innovation allows us to explore more of those at a cost that's affordable and what you're seeing is accelerated top line and continued strong productivity efforts. So it's done, you can do more with less people and arguably with a better employee value proposition because it's more exciting work. So we're quite excited about it and we're staying in the learning mode, we're learning from people inside and outside the company and to me this is an area that holds great promise going forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC. Nik Modi : I'm going to try to squeeze in two if I can. One of the areas that Procter has been addressing for the last few years has been instructing execution. So David, Jon maybe you can just give us some metrics on kind of how things have progressed there how things have improved and then the second question is, you talked about data and kind of targeting consumer groups in a more specific fashion. But I'm just curious like as you think about the next three to five years how good is Procter's data capture as it relates to individual consumers. So you can actually target Joe or Jon versus first time mothers. Thanks. Jon Moeller : In terms of in-store execution is obviously very broad topic, which extends out of the store. So for example, one of the biggest things we need to do is be on stock on a shelf and or behind the shelves in the case of a virtual shopping environment and we've made a lot of progress there coupled both by or driven both by the joint business plans we have with our retail partners, but importantly also the reconfiguration and transformation of our supply chain, which puts 80% of our production within 24 hours of the shelf and allows us to significantly increase service to customers which turns into service to shoppers. We're also working to do a better job of delivering in in-store experience, that's consistent with what we know our key business drivers are which are different by category, different by channel and ensuring that we're measuring performance of our sales organization, not just on physical distribution, but delivery of key business drivers in store. A huge number of brand choices are made in front of a shelf, whether it's a physical shelf or a virtual shelf. And ensuring that - that shelf serves that shopper enables them to select the item this right for them is a significant focus. And I could go on. But this is an area where we still have a lot of improvement opportunity, but we've made significant progress. David Taylor : And on the second half of your question we're actually quite excited about this smart audience work that we're doing in the past, we've had broad demographic groups that we targeted with our media and it's always been said that half your media is wasted and you still don't know what happened. And we have the data now to find out what have it is and we have developed a very large proprietary database. We have over a 1 billion consumer IDs worldwide meaningfully over that. That allows us to have these smart audiences and once you have the smart audiences, you can do propensity marketing with people that have similar characteristics. We have a much larger number of cookie data that allows us to touch devices. But we like best where we got unique consumer ideas - IDs and we run programs around the world and we certainly ask consumers and allow them to opt in. But then we collect data, the right way and use it with the appropriate privacy restraints and to make a meaningful difference. It's part of what can fuel the lean innovation work we're doing because we can get very targeted audiences to test new business ideas new products and new propositions. So I think going forward is only going to get more powerful as we continue to collect data refine it and become more accomplished at performance marketing to taking that data use it in a respectful way to serve consumers products and propositions and messages that meet their needs. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Bonnie Herzog : I actually wanted to ask about your Baby Care business. First and then second positive of course. I would like to hear more about what drove the improvement. And then I was hoping to get your outlook for this business and really what you guys need to do to continue to improve it. Do you still think additional price adjustments will be necessary and maybe the mid and value tiers? And then given any innovation coming in the U.S. maybe on the premium end to counter the new innovation from Kimberly? Thanks David Taylor : Bonnie, I give a couple of comments first overall for global Baby Care. There is a very robust innovation program with myself Jon and a team of the most senior officers in the company have spent an extended period of time with the Baby Care team looking at the next three-year strategy including the innovation program by tier, for major markets. And certainly, we don't announce in advance when we are coming with major innovation but, but the premium in the mid-tier and some of the specialty areas, we have a robust innovation program and it will be coming sequentially and coming fast. If I step back though Baby Care improved the fiscal year with organic sales from last year to this year. Global organic sales did grow in the fourth quarter, we've seen an acceleration on most markets in the back half. China importantly, in the fourth quarter turned very positive to plus 8 U.S. plus 2. This is for China in the first time we've had sales and share growth in five years and it's been driven by the results in both premium tape and pants. So those two combined are driving meaningful growth in China. U.S. Baby Care is making progress, we know we have work left to do. Pure protection is doing well, sweaters is doing well, pants is doing well and we're making - we have innovation coming that will improve the superiority in the mid and value tiers and that will be competitive. We have our eyes wide open. We understand there's other participants in the category and it will be something we have to sequentially, continue to work on. But both global baby, U.S. baby. And then if I look at China Baby there is encouragement and we're excited about the new bundle that's launching this month in China. Pampers Pure into a super premium tier with natural cotton taped in pants, diapers with natural cotton. We have a product on tape and pants featuring cloud soft diapers with visibility. We have upgrades coming right now on mainline and premium, which we [indiscernible] and new itch bond plus taped with double breathable layers. So each of those tiers. We have meaningful upgrades coming. So yes, it's robust and yes, it's competitive and our eyes are wide open and recognize this will be one of continuous innovation. It's just a highly engaged category for consumers, but still attractive. Jon Moeller : And your question about pricing, obviously we can't comment on future pricing, but you should expect as we try and do preimmunize the portfolio that there are pricing opportunities associated with that premiumizations will take advantage of. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Steven Strycula with UBS. Steven Strycula : So question for a high level, is that - it seems like the end markets are really accelerating here in terms of total category, in addition to that, you're improving your market shares. So I want to see - is this analogous to call pre-recession levels, when we are in a trade up economy when you saw a lot of premiumization across the different categories. That will be a one perspective and then the second follow-up question for Jon would be. Could you unpack the commodity versus transport versus FX, a little bit are all three going to be relatively muted or as the net effect that they just kind of level out, maybe two or of one is down? Thank you. David Taylor : Steve, again, I'll take the first as you requested on the growth rates. The growth rate looks to be pretty stable, they're not accelerating, but they are stable at a very good place, and again our innovation is working to grow categories where we can, as I mentioned earlier, they are in the three to four range, a good three right now, it varies by country. But in the most important market for us, the biggest markets it's pretty healthy. U.S. is healthy, China is healthy, India is healthy, Europe is stable at around two and Japan another large market is flat, but yet we're growing share. So in general, we feel pretty good. Whether it's the strongest, it was pre-recession and I have to go back and look at in 7%, 8% range before it hit 6%, 7% range. I think we were in the 4% to 5% range then we're right now and I call it the 3% to 4% range. But we feel good about that and what we have seen to your point, when we offer premium products that have meaningful advantages in many of our big markets. The answer is yes, they are trading up, you're seeing that in some of the specialty areas, the natural for sure. It's an area we've been very active. Our Always and Tampax pure, it was launched March of '19 is doing very well the L. acquisition is doing well native our deodorant acquisition is doing well. Pampers Pure we've mentioned before. So there is many examples Tide, beads, Tide, PODS and the Downy Beads, those are also examples of premium price products where consumers have traded up and they offer delightful benefits. So, yes, on the trade up when you have a meaningful consumer experience advantage and I'd call it healthy relatively stable growth rates of three to four call it 3% to 3.5% right now. Jon Moeller : Jon, the second part of your question in a very broad sense. I would look at currency is year-to-year. This is going into next year as a relatively minor hurt. If you think about markets like Turkey and Argentina where there's been significant devaluation that hasn't yet annualized. If you think about what's happening in the U.K., and what could continue to happen in the UK. That's certainly not the order of magnitude that we saw last year. Having said that, if we were having this conversation last year at this time, I would be telling you the same thing, only to update you on our next earnings call with significant hurts. So it's a very - what I would say it's a constant in that space as volatility, but on a spot basis today a slight hurt. Commodities, on the other hand are a slight hurt on a spot basis that also is a very volatile environment. When you consider the petro complex and all of the natural gas as our biggest commodity exposures and there's a lot happening in the world that can affect those prices. But right now, a small positive transportation, good news is neutral, and hopefully we'll get to the points when we annualized some of the hurts that turns into the small health year-to-year. So that's it in a nutshell. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj : So a couple things, one is just obviously organic sales growth 7%, very pleasing to all of us. Can you give us a sense of how much of that growth is true, same-store sales growth versus shelf space gain growth versus kind of broader distribution reach growth? I've asked similar questions before but I guess I asked in the context of the guidance of 3% to 4% we get your lapping tougher compares, trying to better understand what the drivers of the actual expected slowdown are along those metrics. And then the second question is, if one were to pick a little bit, one would look perhaps at margins and see that even the gross margins were up 120 plus basis points. SG&A investments were higher. Of course, to drive the top line but heavier investments throughout the business, higher comp expenses and that seems to be a pattern across consumer packaged goods. So want to kind of elevate a little bit, if you can maybe David, it's part of your constructive disruption, you've talked about, but can you talk more specifically about where the industry is investing clearly performance marketing is example of that and whether we should think about this at all, is kind of a profitable pool shift in any way in terms of other places of the ecosystem. So are retailer getting the benefit here? Or are there other partners getting the benefit of this reinvestment? And whether that investment just have to stay at this elevated level to get to this 3.5% category growth or whether you think that subsides over time. So thanks very much, about the specific in the broader question. David Taylor : Let me start with the broader one and Jon is going to jump into specifics, but we can kind of bounce back on this one. First the broader question on the market and do I expect elevated investments are required to sustain this growth in many ways we have elevated the investments, and yes, I do believe we have to have meaningful productivity to cover both retailer needs for their value improvement as well as, continuing to meet the consumers' needs with what I expect will be elevated competitive action, but I think that's all doable within the current guidance and that's why we've given a wide range. There's a lot of things that could happen. Having said that, what we are seeing though is the innovation that we've delivered is contributing to markets that are growing our data would say we are a significant part of the reason the markets are healthy in our categories, and we know we have a robust innovation plan coming forth this year and beyond. Secondly, we know and we have line of sight to continue on our current productivity program that is generating meaningful investments and it is covering and we will continue to work with our retailers to ensure that they have - we have with them joint value creation plans that meet both needs. In those, we feel very constructive about. We don't overreact by quarter. So, I don't get overly excited about an overly good or bad quarter. What we're looking for strengths over time and there is very clear trends over the last three years of increasing brand country combinations that we're growing share that breadth covers category and country, look at it by both ways and you see it moved up significantly from '16 to '17 to '18 to \"19, which again gives me confidence that this is a sustainable strategy, and I think the elevated investment is built into our productivity program. Jon. Jon Moeller : I wouldn't have much to add. The one thing though I would make sure you understand. You can follow up with Jon on this, when you look at the elevated SG&A as a measure of investment. You need to take out of a significant increase year-to-year and our accruals for compensation, it's a 100 basis point impact on the quarter in SG&A everything that David said remains true with that excluded, but it's important to understand that as you think about the true year-to-year trend. And then on the top line, the only thing I would add. You mentioned rightly the much tougher comps and I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we are significantly accelerating the two-year average is in terms of the top line growth rate. We just need to do in an environment as we've all been discussing this morning where we fully expect continued heightened competition and to not allow for that reality within our guidance range would seem less than - less than prudent. So we've done that. The way to contextualize the top line is we're growing at or ahead of the market with a bias towards growing ahead and that's, as I said in my prepared remarks, not a layup. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell, I'm sorry, Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : David, can you comment a little bit on Grooming the same way as you gave on the Baby - on the state of the Baby side, it was definitely refreshing to see the inflection on a two year stack over the past eight quarters, and as Jon Moeller was saying just now, I think that's an acceleration. But can you comment on how sustainable this trend is going forward and how the Gillette online initiatives can kind of sustain and also in the key markets to where you've learned from the experience in the U.S. that you're bringing over I believe the U.K. and as well, as the channels in club and then in particular, is your key competitor consolidated. So if you can give us kind of that state would be helpful. Thank you. David Taylor : Very good. Grooming remains an attractive business, as we said and we haven't lost our enthusiasm for many, many reasons and we did talk organic sales, did grow this fiscal year and we had a good ending of the year. A couple of things that are, frankly, very positive about the future. One is the big new innovation called Skin Guard continues to pick up share. It's already double-digit in several of the focused markets that we have launched it has been expanded around the world right now, and it addresses a very specific benefit of people that have sensitive skin. The strategy that we've pivoted to and I think will bear fruits over time is looking at the full ladder from double-edge all the way up to the heated razor. So you go from pennies to very expensive products depending on what your need is. We're now more actively playing in disposables including with innovation and disposables with censorial benefits being delivered with things like Luber strips. We now have innovation across the mid tier, which is - in the mark line in the premium line. All those to me are important. Then by market, we have to figure out what is the right ladder and what is the right demand programs to be able to drive trial and the other - we have to do and you've seen meaningful changes is figure out had to be relevant to GenZ and millennial and we've made progress there as well. So the SkinGuard initiatives performing well. It's in U.S., Canada, parts of Europe and overall acceptance has been strong. The after use experience is very strong. So all of our efforts now are to drive trial and awareness and if that continues and that's a good tailwind for us. We have our eyes wide open; we recognize we had a significant headwind on broad, societal trend on shaving and we're broadening our view with how we view Grooming and making sure we have products that also allow you to trim and other ways to take care of facial hair. And so both the Braun and the Gillette programs to me a very active and robust. And to me that the plan going forward is robust. It will be both relevance, communication, innovation and focused on ensuring that we bring it to life in ways that work with consumers, each market in which we focus. Operator : And then now we'll go to Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Bill Chappell : Just a question on the competitive response and what you're seeing. I know you expect competitive response to the market share gains in the strength. But just want to understand, like - are you seeing a different competitive response, because it doesn't seem that we're seeing the same kind of price cutting promotional levels kind of even around the world. But especially in the U.S., that we have in the past and so are the competitors reacting differently or you just - they haven't reacted yet. And so we're just kind of waiting for those price cuts to come? David Taylor : We have seen competitive reactions. And I think broadly each competitor acting consistent with this strategy. I would characterize the market is constructive right now. You're seeing an increased level of innovation, which frankly we like and that's a challenge, we look forward to addressing. We're seeing innovation across all price tiers, that's again an approach that we're happy to address. I believe that generally people have learned a lot from past actions and each company has to decide what their value creation plan is. And to date, I have not seen behavior that would increase concern on market attractiveness in the 10 categories in which we participate. Operator : And next we'll go to Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse. Kaumil Gajrawala : Can you talk bit about media spending? I guess there's two conversations, one is a kind of increased focus on traditional media. And then also a conversation about increased spending, media spending directly with the retailers. Can you talk about how you're thinking about that going forward? David Taylor : First, let me start with the macro headline. We're looking in at stronger media delivery, stronger programs at lower cost. We found ourselves in many cases over frequented. So our frequency of ad presentation was too high and our reach was too low we're adjusting that. As we do that, we're finding efficiencies in our overall media program. And we've talked about the significant opportunities that exist within the media supply chain including media compensation, our agency compensation and production costs and we're working to reduce that all with the idea of increasing the overall effectiveness of our program which includes the right mix different by category for both traditional and digital media. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : I wanted to come back to the Gillette business as well. First the housekeeping question, just for Jon, on the impairment charge I understand it's non-cash, but more concerned about potentially what it may signal David said it pretty positive a moment ago and results have gotten better. So maybe just confirm, this is an annual requirement as opposed to some sort of triggering event that would be helpful. And then David, I think the question was asked earlier. I'm not sure you necessarily touched on it. Just in terms of the potential implications from Edgewell's acquisition of Harry's and bringing on their leadership team what they may bring your current views on the implications of consolidation in the space and how you see the competitive dynamic potentially changing. And what you guys have embedded in your outlook? Thank you. David Taylor : We test each of our goodwill and intangible assets every year that's our requirement. And we've been indicating really for the last number of years that the cushion, if you will. In other words, the value that we're coming up with every year, as compared to the value that we're carrying on our balance sheet has been declining. If you look back at any of our financial statements over the last three years, you'll see reference to that. And we've talked about how that cushion has been declining. The drivers of that are primarily two-fold. One is foreign exchange and you've got here a business with a very broad global footprint and particularly with the year that we've just been through that impacts that value assessment. The second, we've also had many conversations about which is the - the impact on market size in developed markets from overall shaving incidents, which is down. And those two things as they get factored into our annual evaluation at some point, get us to a value that's less than the value we currently have in our balance sheet and that kicks in a pretty complicated process to get to the new goodwill number and Jon can take you through that offline as needed. But it is-- it's a nondiscretionary annual valuation test. That's led to this outcome has been clearly telegraphed. I think in our financial reports. Jon Moeller : And I'll take the second part of the question. I'm happy to give more detail on Gillette. First that the Edgewell acquisition of Harry's does this propose additional risk to the business. It's still early, the deal is not closed and we generally don't speculate on what we think competition is going to do. I will say a few things that we are doing that I think positions us well and broadly, if you step back, Grooming rather Edgewell is going to have to make money they bought a company we've seen both Unilever's acquisition of Dollar Shave Club and now the Edgewell acquisition of Harry's both of the parent companies that have bought those start-ups, need to make money and to me that's not a bad thing for the overall value creation opportunities in the industry. If I step back again and look at what we're doing, we're doing more differentiation, you've seen our Joy of launch at Walmart has done very, very well as we can activate across the ladder. And what we're seeing now with our willing to differentiate we're rejuvenating both the Gillette, and the Venus brands, the campaigns that we've put out there are working they are engaging very much with GenZ and millennials and we've seen a significant positive 80% positive response millennials to our recent campaigns and there likelihood to purchase Gillette, which I think is positive. Online, you mentioned the U.S. Gillette DTC while still smallest double than us in the past 12 months our e-commerce business is growing in the UK, when I think both competitors showed up, we in this time and we're much more competitive defending our business ensuring we provided attractive user experiences in value to those consumers. And we've maintained share leadership in that segment. We've recently expanded Gillette DTC in Germany and Australia launched Venus DTC in the U.S. So we've stepped up ensuring that we can serve consumers on and offline. It's part of the superiority strategy, which is we want to win, where the consumer wants to shop, and while the majority is still done offline. We recognize, we need to step up our game both user experience value and offerings, but direct-to-consumer more broadly in the e-commerce and have done that. So I believe we are well positioned. We see it as again competitive category but attractive category and the acquisition by Edgewell to me doesn't change our interest are frankly our confidence that the plan is robust. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy with Macquarie. Caroline Levy : I'm wondering if you just step back and think about the last decade has been very challenging for the companies that have already got the big brands and I'm wondering when you might. If you do expect something to shift from advantage small disrupted to advantage P&G and this quarter may be an example of where things are starting to come together. You've seen it in the U.S., you've seen in China for more than a quarter more than a year. Do you think this is going to start happening in other countries and kind of a secondary question on this is how the organization changed such that Harry's or other disruptors are not going to be allowed to flourish before you move. David Taylor : Just a few comments. Certainly, again our eyes wide open and we do see the environment as highly competitive, we understand there's a lot of new entrants in the category, but we don't have just a strong quarter. We have got over the last three years, we've seen increasing brand country combinations grow and we've talked about the breadth of our brands and countries improving and we've got now four quarters of 4% or better, which I think is a meaningful sustained level of progress and we certainly expect we need these go out and continue to earn it. Big brands continue to do well when they address consumer needs, they have to stay relevant and how they present themselves in both package and communication and they have to have an experience that justifies the cost and is better than the best alternatives and our big brands are doing well and we've extended our self into the fast-growing areas in many cases, it's been an extension of the parent brand. You've seen that on Tide, you've seen that on many other brands. You've also seen that where we've gone into additional areas, whether it's the L. acquisition native Walker & Company and others to ensure we continue to learn. To your question, do we think the organization is better prepared to deal with the competitive environment we're in. Yes, we have simplified the organization in a way where the focus markets to me have increased focus the enterprise markets because of the high volatility have an organization structure that allows them to address that and get and react much more quickly. We've shifted broadly to an organization that is engaged much more agile and it goes to everything from how we innovate, which is small teams cycling fast to the fact that we now have one axis of decision making on primary choices that address this threat which is the sector business unit. And so the need in the past at times to need to get alignment across the organization, it's been meaningfully reduced. We value the input from other parts of the organization, but the leaders that run the businesses are accountable in touch and they have folks in the market. So, I think we're actually well positioned to see and then respond to competitive threats and if we do our job right, we understand the consumer needs and we're ahead of those. We're creating the new categories, opportunities in segments of growth and we're seeing progress there as well. But it's highly respectful of our competition aware of increased competitive actions, but believing that this is a robust and sustainable strategy focused on the core superiority funded by productivity and then brought to life by over 90,000 people that have embraced this strategy, believe in it and are executing with increasing excellence. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark Astrachan : Wanted to ask more of a broad kind of longer term questions so historically, your portfolio is heard less well during recessionary times, not that were imminently heading into one, but just curious how you think about readying the portfolio or how you think the current portfolio response during an economic downturn and how that we compare to where the company was 10 years or so ago. What's different this time around, do you think? David Taylor : A couple of comments. One of the areas that I think causes us to be at least well-positioned to deal with whatever comes out is one we're in categories where performance matters to the consumers their daily use categories. So they don't go away, and frankly the need to engage with them, generally doesn't get reduced in a recession and the other is our brands today have broader ladders. We play across many price tiers and many benefit segments. So, I think we're actually in many ways, better positioned, because we have now identified where we can create value in each category and then established the appropriate both price tiers and benefit delivery for that category and I mentioned automatic dish earlier. We have a base; we have a premium then we have a super premium. That's true in the laundry category. That's true certainly in Shave Care, that's true in Baby Care. We have many segments represent VIM Care. We have multiple segments representing our Family Care business. We have multiple segments in our Oral Care business. So if you look at that at least now we're playing in segments and then what we're doing better and better using the data we have is we're understanding the specific needs of consumers in each segment and designing to make sure we're delight but recognize part of the delight is a competitive price point and to me, we're doing that better in, but it gets back to superiority has to be in the eyes of the consumer or the customer or the evaluator and to me where we've raised the bar on the expectation of what we deliver to delight the consumer. Jon Moeller : Everything that David says of course, extremely relevant. I would just emphasize one point that he made which is the difference in the portfolio. Just think for example of not of Swan Hair Care, Prestige Fragrances much more discretionary items in which discretion is exercised when times get tough. We have categories now that as David said daily use staples, it doesn't mean we are immune to trade down but that - that goes to his point of having a broader ladder of offerings, the right size offerings in the store then address tightened cash outlay needs, etc. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge. Jonathan Feeney : So you've told us since 2013, if I add up all of the citation for currency headwind that you've got had what has amounted to something like a little over $2 in today's tax rate and share count, in total currency impact over the past six years. And I guess I'm wondering is it really just as simple as had we had a flat dollar since 2013, you'd be making 40% plus more and presumably, if currency ever reverses or just stays the same, is that just to just think about or if it reversed back to 2013 levels proportionately would we expect to get that as a tailwind in the coming years. I know you cited Jon that currency is still a little bit of headwind for next year. Thanks very much. Jon Moeller : I mean, directionally, and you can go back and compare our earnings per share to the currency movements over time you can do it on an industry level and you will see a clear relationship between those two. Having said that, as you can imagine in the scenario that you cite where things go back to 2013 levels what ultimately ends up happening from an EPS standpoint it's going to be dependent on pricing moves that competitors and others choose to make as a result of that. So it's not that simple. But directionally, it is tough currency years are tough earnings years, easier currency years are easier earnings years. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI. Robert Ottenstein : Two questions please, first in April of this year, Amazon went to next day prime delivery and saw a sharp acceleration in their business. I'm wondering to what degree you also sure saw an acceleration in your business with Amazon. I know that you've got very well coordinated logistics shared warehouses with them, just like a little bit more detail in terms of how your business with Amazon is evolving. Are you gaining - getting share gains there and do you see this close coordination as a sustainable advantage and the second question has to do with the detergent category grew 5% volume in the quarter? Hard to believe that our global industry is growing that fast. So maybe a little bit of details in terms of where you're gaining share and what's going on in that category. Thank you. Jon Moeller : Let me just provide a little bit of summary level response to that and then I'll give David the detail. We don't comment on dynamics what individual retailers for reasons I'm sure you can readily understand. But we feel very well positioned broadly and we certainly view Amazon as a very strong partner. In terms of the question on detergent, I'll answer that more generally, too, which is, with the exception of what I mentioned earlier, which has been a small inventory build and customers looking to shorten delivery times to customers in the U.S. We have not seen significant changes in retail inventory levels. We are pretty much tracking our sales growth with consumption growth in most of the markets in which we're operating. So that volume growth you're seeing is largely consumption driven. David Taylor : And let me add one point on that, just if you could kind of unpack a bit Fabric Care - Fabric Care is more than laundry. Fabric Care also includes fabric enhancers. So you get everything from dryer sheets to liquid fabric refreshers all the way to beads. And that category fabric enhancers is what we call it has been growing very nicely. Faster than the what you consider the detergent category because you're probably right. You're not going to see a huge spike in detergents, but one of the things we've done in that category and many categories is broaden our view of the benefits we can provide that is why we call it, Fabric Care not laundry. And in Fabric Care there's many things you can do to extend the life of a fabric and to deliver a variety of benefits beyond just clean or stain removal. It can be antistatic; it can be softening. It can be extended freshness over time, and we do that in a way that's delightful for consumers and created a very large business. Fabric enhancers is now - I think over $750 million business and growing and that's part of what's been a driver of fabric cares outsized growth and they've just done a beautiful job again understanding the consumer need in this broad category called Fabric Care and doing it very well. And it has contributed to an acceleration in category growth in many markets. The U.S. is probably one of the best examples. If you go back many years, it was flat to 1% and it ticked up several percent behind Tide, pods, beads and frankly we've reinvigorated even the beads business by again delivering benefits in communicating the compelling way. So part of what every category has to take on is market growth is a key part of the sustainable strategy we have and you're seeing more and more examples of superior innovation driving market growth, which then allows us to have the balanced top and bottom line growth that we aspire to deliver. Operator : And we'll take our final question from the line of Jon Andersen with William Blair. Jon Andersen : Just one quick one, you're kind of eight years now into 10 years of productivity and cost savings, which have been significant. This is obviously critical as you've pointed out key to achieving the balance that you're looking for in the business top and bottom line growth with margin improvement. So as you kind of look out beyond two years and take a longer-term perspective. Is the kind of the cost and productivity opportunity similarly strong as you look out over time, on an absolute or relative basis as it has been over the past seven or eight years with everything you've achieved? Thank you. David Taylor : I don't have specific visibility to something that's out that far, but I will make a couple of comments. One is the earnings progress that we made and the progress we made in offsetting some of the FX items that Jon was referring to earlier was largely productivity based. And we were very clear that was not a sufficient program or strategy that we simply had to get the top line growing at reasonable rates while maintaining a focus on productivity in order to create value. And so, hopefully at the end of the two-year period, you're talking about our top line is in fact sustained at a higher rate. From a productivity standpoint. Well, I'm not going to talk about dollars today. What I would say is that there are increasing number of tools that are available, particularly in the digital space, which give us a reason to continue to become even more and more productive and more and more effective across our set of activity systems. So that's, what I'd offer you today. The importance of productivity is not going to go away. The tools that we have available increase every day, but we also have to deliver that topline, which by itself from a leverage standpoint is a huge driver of margin improvement. Jon Moeller : I think that ends the questions, and let me just close with one. Thank you for investing the time and discussing P&G, our strategies are beginning to deliver sustainable balanced growth and value creation. We have our eyes wide open; we know there's still work to do, but we're confident we're on the right track. We must continue and we will continue to build the superiority advantage. We'll continue to invest in productivity, but the credit goes to 90,000 people they are doing - 90,000 plus are doing a wonderful job bringing the strategy to life around the world and continuing to build value for all the stakeholders of this company. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning and welcome to Procter & Gamble's Quarter End Conference Call. P&G would like to remind you that today's discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections. Also as required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business trends and has posted on its Investor Relations website www.pginvestor.com a full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Now, I will turn the call over to P&G's Vice Chairman, Chief Operating Officer, and Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller. Jon Moeller : Good morning. I know you're very busy this morning, so I'm going to make this very brief, about 10 minutes, and then turn straight to your questions. It's another strong quarter topline, bottom-line, and cash driven by our portfolio superiority, productivity, constructive disruption, and organization strategies. Organic sales up 7%, four points of volume growth, three points of price mix. Two-year stack growth strengthened into an average of 5.5%. Over the last five quarters, two-year average growth has accelerated 2.5%, 3%, 3%, 4%, now 5.5%. Growth continues to be broad-based. Each global category grew organic sales. Personal Care up mid-teens, Personal Health Care grew double-digits, Fabric Care, Home Care, Feminine Care, Family Care, and Oral Care each grew high singles, Hair Care grew mid-singles. Each geographic region grew organic sales 4% or more. Focus markets and enterprise markets each up high singles. Our two largest markets the U.S., up 6%; China, up 13%. Japan another large market was up double-digits due in part to the timing benefit of VAT changes that went into effect on October 1st. E-commerce sales grew over 30%. All channel consumption remained ahead of underlying markets driving aggregate market share growth. Moving to the bottom-line, core earnings per share was $1.37, up 22% versus the prior year. Foreign exchange was a $50 million after-tax headwind about $0.02 per share. On a constant currency basis, core earnings per share was up 24%. Very strong underlying earnings progress; core gross margin, up 190 basis points; core operating margin, up 260 basis points; continued strong cash flow with adjusted free cash flow productivity of 91%; $1.9 billion of dividends paid; $3 billion of P&G stock repurchased. In summary, a very strong quarter, solid volume, sales, and market share trends across categories and geographies. Strong operating earnings, margins advancing, strong core earnings per share growth, and continued high levels of cash returned to shareowners. We continue to face challenges from a very volatile macro and geopolitical landscape and from competitive response to our faster growth, but we're making progress behind integrated and mutually reinforcing strategies. We focused and strengthened our portfolio in daily-use categories where performance drives brand choice, in categories where we occupy a number one or number two position which have historically grown faster than the balance of the company and are more profitable. If you're in categories where performance drives brand choice, you better perform. We made a deliberate choice to invest in the superiority of our products and packages, retail execution, marketing, and value in all price tiers where we compete, strengthening the short- and long-term health and competitiveness of our brands. We are extending our margin of advantage and increasing the quality of execution. Additional investment will be needed to sustain this progress. The need for this investment the need to offset macro cost headwinds and the need to drive balanced top and bottom-line growth including margin expansion underscore the continued importance of productivity; cost out cash in; driving cost savings and efficiency improvements in all facets of our business in our second five-year $10 billion productivity program; expecting strong free cash flow productivity from working capital and CapEx efficiency. Superiority and productivity are critical, but insufficient to keep us ahead in a world with a rapidly changing retail environment, quickly evolving consumer needs, media transformation, revolutionary changes in technology. We must and are leading the constructive disruption of our industry across all areas of the value chain. We're disrupting the way we innovate by accelerating the speed and quality of our learning through lean innovation. We're monetizing innovation across industries to accelerate investment in R&D and broaden societal impact. We are disrupting in retail execution. We're reinventing brand building from wasteful mass marketing to mass one-to-one brand building fueled by data and technology. We continue to disrupt our supply chain with transformation across the globe. Finally, we're making organization structure and culture changes to better position us to win. We're taking steps to simplify the organization focusing effort, clarifying responsibility, increasing accountability, and structuring compensation and incentive programs to better align with these objectives. On July 1st, we officially moved to a new organization structure designed to de-matrix the company and provide even greater clarity on responsibilities and reporting lines to focus and strengthen leadership accountability. We're operating in six industry-based sector business units or SBUs. The SBUs have profit and loss responsibility for the largest markets what we call the focus markets which represent about 80% of sales and 90% of the company's profit. The SBUs CEOs are focused on winning and driving value creation opportunities in these important markets. We continue to invest in enterprise markets which have very attractive market growth rates. Our organizational structure there is being optimized to accelerate growth top and bottom-line in the dynamic macro environments that those markets present. The benefit of this design is the creation of a more focused, agile, accountable organization, operating at a lower cost, focused on winning through superiority, fueled by productivity, moving at the speed of the market. I hope it continues to be evident that we've been successfully disrupting P&G. The choices we've made to focus and strengthen our portfolio in daily-use categories where performance drives brand choice, to establish and extend superiority of our brands, to make productivity as integral to our culture as innovation, to lead constructive disruption across the value chain, and to improve organization focus, agility, and accountability are not independent strategies. They reinforce and build on each other. They position us well within our industry to deal with near-term macro and competitive challenges. They are the foundation for stronger balanced growth and value creation over the short, mid, and long-term. Moving now to guidance. We're raising our outlook on each key metric : organic sales growth, core earnings per share growth and free cash flow productivity. We're increasing our outlook for organic sales growth from a range of 3% to 4% to a range of 3% to 5%. The markets in which we compete are growing at a 3% to 3.5% pace, so the midpoint of the higher organic sales range implies continued market share growth. On the bottom line, we're raising our core earnings per share growth guidance from a range of 4% to 9% to a range of 5% to 10%. This reflects very strong first quarter results and our expectation of solid margin expansion for the year. We're raising our outlook for free cash flow productivity from 90% to 95% for the fiscal year. The year will continue along track record of significant cash generation and cash return to shareowners. We expect to pay over $7.5 billion in dividends and repurchase $6 billion to $8 billion of P&G shares in fiscal 2020. While our first quarter results enable us to raise fiscal year targets, please keep in mind that the comps get more difficult as we move through the year, both on the top line and the bottom line. Quarter year-ago top line 4%, 4%, 5%, 7% as we progress through last fiscal year; bottom line 3%, 5%, 6%, 17%. Japan VAT-related timing impacts benefited Q1 company sales results by 30 basis points to 40 basis points but will cause a headwind in Q2. Pricing annualizes as we move through the year affecting both top and bottom line trends. We'll comp the earnings gains from the loss of land sale and the Oral Care brand divestitures in Q4. Competitors will likely respond to our outperformance, which underscores the need for continued investment and superiority. Brexit uncertainty and volatility in foreign exchange Argentina and Turkey for example will be impacting the balance of year results. Our revised guidance is based on current market growth rates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Significant currency weakness, commodity cost increases or additional geopolitical disruptions are not anticipated within the new and improved guidance ranges. With that, I'm happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks. Good morning. I just want to ask a little bit about the build for profitability. And in particular, you know an area I've been really focused on is operating leverage and as you're showing this really as you put it new and improved top line growth performance. So this quarter much of the upside was driven by in fact positive operating leverage. And yet productivity despite you calling out the importance of it ongoing in your script was quite, quite low relative to historical quarterly performance. So can you just talk a little bit, I guess, about the outlook for productivity this year? And how we should think about operating leverage? Because it accelerated sequentially even with kind of a comparable revenue performance sequentially. So, just how to kind of work through the math on operating leverage on the stronger top line. Thanks. Jon Moeller : A stronger top line definitely provides greater operating leverage, as you rightly point out. We had about 50 points of -- 50 basis points of leverage within the gross margin improvement of 190 basis points. And we had an additional 180 basis points of sales leverage between gross and operating. So, 230 basis points overall against a margin improvement on an operating level of 260 basis points. And I think that's \u2013 generally, if we grow the rule of thumb is if we grow 4%, we should have 50 basis points to 75 basis points of leverage. That increases pretty significantly as we move up the curve beyond 4% and you saw that in the quarter we just completed. Productivity continues to be a significant focus area. Some of our savings are backloaded as we go through this year. But again, they'll be comping significantly higher earnings numbers in the base periods. There are still very large opportunities in front of us : efficiencies in media, efficiencies in organization design, significant savings as we bring on fully the product supply transformation and big opportunities top and bottom line from increasing digitization of our efforts all around. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Hey, good morning folks and congratulations on a strong start to the year. Geez lots of questions still on the table. Let me start with growth. I guess, my one question with you out there in terms of market growth. Jon you mentioned in your script that you expect price contribution to wane as the year progresses and you comped last year's price gains which I think is intuitively understandable for all of us. But you're pegging your full year guidance to a market growth rate of just 3% to 3.5%, which presumably that market growth is going to experience that same phenomenon of waning price growth. So my question is, is it reasonable to assume that market growth also slows with price moderation? Or are you seeing and do you expect to see a pickup in terms of volume mix contribution both for your firm in aggregate like we saw this quarter and the market overall? Jon Moeller : Thanks Jason. We do expect to -- we've seen -- the underlying market growth rates there has been a price component as you rightly point out that should annualize itself as you rightly point out. But there's also been an increase in the volume component of market growth. So we are seeing an increase on the margin and market growth in the units. And that should continue as we progress forward. In terms of our own top line algorithm, price was one point of the seven in the quarter. So if you assume that completely annualizes that's one point impact. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Steve Powers : Yes. Hey, thanks. Good morning. Jon I was hoping you could take a step back and talk a little bit more broadly about what you're seeing with regard to consumer demand and competition in three markets if I could : Russia, China and Brazil? Is there anything you're seeing now that concerns you in terms of competitive activity or waning demand in any of those -- in any of your key categories in those markets? Thanks. Jon Moeller : That was Russia, Brazil, China. Generally, Steve across the board, we are seeing continued consumer strength. And generally across the board, we are seeing the levels of healthy competition that you would generally expect. If I take the markets in question. China we were up 13% in the quarter. Market growth rates continued to be strong. It's a very competitive environment always has been, likely will be for the foreseeable future just given the opportunity and the size of price. And that's both local competition and multinational competition. But we haven't seen any significant uptick in the levels of competition. It's always on always strong in a market like China. The consumer in China continues to respond to premium innovation that performs in categories where performance drives brand choice and we see that time and time again on both sides of the ledger. In terms of the other markets that you mentioned, consumer demand in Brazil continues to be strong and respond to strong innovation. But it's -- I would describe it as more volatile and more fickle than for example China. Our growth rates in Brazil vary pretty dramatically by quarter but generally continue to be strong. In the quarter we just completed we grew 2% in Brazil. But prior to that we were growing at significantly higher rates; I don't view that 2% as a slowdown in consumer as much as I do just inherent variability and volatility of that business. And Russia continues to perform as well. We grew the business 5% in the quarter in Russia. From a competitive standpoint, again those markets are very strong as it relates to competition, nothing specific to note. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj : Hi, guys. So I just had a couple of questions if I could. One is just actually the broader question here is on sustainability of such strong results. And I guess you're guiding throughout to a little bit of slowdown lapping tough numbers et cetera. So I was hoping you could give some more color, a little bit about two pieces in particular and you touched on it a moment ago. But just more around pricing, particularly pricing as commodities perhaps are rolling over here and you have less of a cost justified reason to take the pricing up. And secondly in terms of the volumes you mentioned certainly growth in the category from unit\u2019s perspective, but your unit growth is outsized. And I just wonder how much of that is from what we're actually seeing on shelf, which is more shelf space growth. So how just kind of same-store sales same square foot sales versus growth from a shelf space perspective? That's a sustainability question. And a sub-question to that is you, obviously, like everybody else have some really good categories more than really good right now, really good businesses and some that aren't doing so well, obviously, Grooming regarding some pieces of Baby Care et cetera. I'm trying to figure out whether you're seeing different retailer reactions or interactions with you given your haves and have not-type categories. I understand you have fewer categories than perhaps most that aren\u2019t firing on all cylinders, but are you seeing that retailers pull different levers when things aren't growing the way they'd like to be? Thanks very much. Jon Moeller : First, as it relates to sustainability of the results. Comp issues aside and the comp issues are -- or the comp dynamic is obviously real and prevalent and increasingly prevalent as we progress through the fiscal year. We've really tried to ensure two things are an inherent part of how we think about the business and operate the business and both lend themselves to sustainability of results over the long-term. The first is balance across the top and bottom line. I think you saw in the quarter that we just reported, it's a very balanced quarter in terms of strong growth on both. And to the extent that we can continue to deliver both, which we're committed to do the overall value creation result becomes much more sustainable. We've witnessed periods of time in our company and certainly within the industry and adjacent industries where the focus has disproportionately shifted, for example, to the bottom line. That is not a sustainable strategy in our view. And we've seen instances certainly in our own experience where focus has shifted disproportionately to the top line, which also is not a sustainable strategy in our view. So the balancing of the top and bottom line does lead to an expectation of more sustainable value creation delivery. The second piece is probably even more important and that is how we\u2019re thinking about sources of growth. And we're really trying as part of our superiority strategy to source growth through creation of business in the marketplace by driving market growth. That is a much more sustainable and generally more profitable way to drive our business. We\u2019re creating business not taking business from others. And when you are the driver of market growth, you will mathematically build share. So those two concepts are not incongruent. They're in complete congruence. And the question is how do you most sustainably and profitably build share? And we're now contributing to market growth at rates above our market share, which is exactly where we want to be, but that's important to the dynamics that I just described. It's also much more meaningful and relevant to our retail partners. They frankly could care less about P&G market share gains. What they care about is the overall market basket and the margins that they earn on that basket. So both of those focuses from a business model standpoint should conceptually increase the sustainability of our results. We'll have to demonstrate that in the marketplace. But certainly over the last five quarters if you look at the top line 4%, 4%, 5%, 7%, 7% doesn't guarantee anything in the future but it's been sustainable progress at least for a period of time. Relative to pricing, we -- I want to be careful on commenting on future pricing activities. What I would say is that to date, we feel good about the pricing that we've taken both as it relates to commodities and as it relates to foreign exchange and some of the developing markets. But that's something we look at on a category country basis every morning when we make up, and we'll adjust as we need to. Relative to the source of volume growth, I mentioned a significant portion of our growth is coming through creation of new business. There is as well and you're right to point out increase in distribution as you would expect given the demonstrated ability to grow markets for our retail partners. But those two things are not separable. And we've talked previously about the retail view of P&G, which has improved significantly, earning top consumer, products manufacturer at Walmart, really across the board and increasing \u2013 you saw the Advantage Monitor, survey where we're number one in our industry across all metrics that are measured and number one by a significant margin. We need to keep improving that. That's not any guarantee for success tomorrow but it is one of the reasons coupled with demonstrated ability to grow markets in many categories that we are increasing the level of distribution. And I don't see that as a step-function curve. I think it has room to continue to grow. Obviously to the extent that we demonstrate the same dynamic across more categories that's another driver of future growth. Operator : All right. Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : Good morning, guys. So sticking to the subject of top line growth and sustainability, I was hoping you'd give us an update on what you saw in fiscal Q1 in terms of a competitive response both on the pricing front as well as in terms of marketing spend from your key competitors given your market share gains. And give us a sense of what you're assuming in guidance in the balance of the year from a competitive environment standpoint, if the environment heats up as you cycle some of these price increases and theoretically competitors look to regain some share momentum. Jon Moeller : Thanks, Dara. You've certainly heard and not surprisingly competition talking about reinvesting in their businesses. I think that's driven by two things. One is the turnover of a generation of leadership in many of our competitive set. And two is the result situation that, we've been talking about together here this morning. We have not seen anything destructive in a mass aggregate scale in the market place from a competitive standpoint. We operate in very competitive industries so that doesn't change. But there hasn't been a step-function increase for example in the level of volume that's being sold on promotion. There has been increased initiative activity innovation driven. That's generally constructive for market growth. So we support that and we'll see. I do expect generally competition to increase as we continue going through the fiscal year. And remember, the time that exist between when you state an intent and when you can actually execute in the market is not short. It's relatively long, just given shelf set dynamics at retail, execution dynamics associated with for example innovation. So I wouldn't say that, we've seen everything that we're going to see. We're in a better position to deal with that than we've been in a long time given increasing percentage of our sales that are superior from a product package communication go-to-market standpoint. We still have work to do, which is why we're going to continue to invest and fund that through productivity. And that's our best defense. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark Astrachan : Yeah. Thanks and good morning, everybody. I just wanted to dig a bit deeper in some category specifics there. So, curious your thoughts about, what you're seeing in kind of real time in paper goods and competitive dynamics in laundry. It seems like you've had kind of the strongest volume growth on very strong comparisons there. Pricing maybe dipped a little bit sequentially underlying. I'm just curious, if that's a competitive response if that's proactive. Is there something in the market that's kind of changed? Just sort of there any color there will be helpful on those categories. Thank you. Jon Moeller : Laundry had a very strong quarter, up 8% driven by momentum really across the globe. We continue to advance the premium segment both laundry and fabric enhancers. Global value share was up about 0.5 point. Our growth on those premium segments, which include single-unit dose and scent beads, was high-teens and that's \u2013 that's really e-commerce sales up almost 50%. So, really what we're seeing there is innovation-driven, superiority-driven, market-growth-accretive growth, which to the point of the earlier question I expect would be sustainable at some level. And that's what I think about when I think about the laundry and fabric enhancer's category not a specific competitive dynamic. We continue to grow the paper businesses at very high levels in aggregate. And that segment, because of its \u2013 those segments because of their capital intensity are a little bit more responsive from a competitive dynamic standpoint to a variety of factors. But again, I would characterize the landscape as innovation-driven superiority-driven market-accretive growth. Think about \u2013 let's take one of those businesses Feminine Care as an example. Feminine Care in a quarter we grew 7% and that's composed of both strong growth on our base feminine protection business and high-teens level growth on our adult incontinence business. And we had an objective as we entered that category to source our growth through increased market growth. And we essentially doubled the rate of market growth for the adult incontinence category across the geographies where we've entered. So, again that is the predominance or the character of the landscape and the growth drivers as I see it. Operator : And next we'll go to Wendy Nicholson with Citi. Wendy Nicholson : Hi. Good morning. My question has to do with the U.S. market the U.S. consumer and it's less about pricing than it is maybe the mix of your businesses and brands. If the U.S. consumer is going to slow number one, do you think you see that coming early enough to react and to make sure that the fact that so many of your brands are relatively premium priced in your categories don't cede share? So, I guess the question is on brands, like Luvs or Gain, are you thinking about doing more innovation there more, promotion there, more feature displays? Or is it a pack size issue? In other words, if the economy slows how do you make sure that people don't feel pinched and trade down from some of your more premium-priced brands? Thanks. Jon Moeller : In terms of predicting any kind of consumer acceleration or consumer slowdown, we really \u2013 we aren't in that business. There are many things that can affect consumer confidence that are things we wouldn't even have the ability to anticipate today, certain geopolitical events, certain political developments within a country, et cetera. So your guess is as good as ours in terms of what market growth does going forward. We have seen no signs of weakness. We have seen continued sequential improvement on the margin. But that can change pretty quickly as we've all witnessed during our lifetimes. We are better positioned today for several reasons to deal with a downturn than we were for example in 2007, 2008. Number one, we are largely out of highly discretionary categories. This was part and parcel of our thinking as we moved to daily-use categories, categories that consumers are much less likely to go without on a daily basis. Generally, we don't see consumers stopping laundry or shampooing or conditioning or feminine protection during a recession. To your point, they may trade down and I'll come to that in a second. But from a category standpoint and a portfolio composition standpoint, we are much better positioned than we were previously. That's number one. Number two, as we've been talking about throughout this call, we are much better positioned from a brand advantage standpoint. The products performing at noticeable levels of superiority in terms of meeting very important consumer needs and desires. And that is a major contributor to the overall value equation that consumers use as they assess their brand choice. There are two portfolio matters : So we've moved not only into daily-use categories but into categories where performance drives brand choice. And we're continuing to invest to build that advantage which is no guarantee but does increase the resilience of the portfolio to headwinds from a consumer standpoint. Third, we've worked to improve the pricing ladders, the availability of product at different price points, different pack sizes. That also is not a guarantee. But you put all of that together, again no guarantees but we're in a much better place. We will use tools like value messaging, like pack sizes, like performance messaging to ensure that if there is a downturn, we're as best positioned for consumers who are in a pinch. Operator : And next we'll go to Steve Strycula with UBS. Steve Strycula : Hi, good morning and congratulations on a good quarter. So I have a question on supply chain in click and collect and the rise of online with that \u2013 how that impacts your business. Specifically, wanted to understand, as you see in stores require more and more inventory for stuff going out the side of the door, how do we think about that impacting your categories? Are you reducing your SKU count at all? How does that impact the weeks of supply in stock throughout the supply chain? Because we've noticed over, let's call it the last two years, most CPG companies have been reporting the national retailers are bringing down these weeks of supply. Would you say they were kind of like near a bottom, especially in a portfolio like Proctor, where you're seeing the sales productivity lift much higher? Should we expect a \u2013 you talk rate a little bit differently than the peer set? Thank you. Jon Moeller : We want to be SKU efficient and have the right assortment at the shelf both in terms of serving the consumer and in terms of the right turnover for our retail partners. Nothing has really changed in that context. Relative to the trade inventory situation, I think we mentioned on the last call, a slight increase in inventories across the retail channel not consistently but in aggregate to support the things that you are describing as well as a commitment from a delivery standpoint to have product available for consumers on shorter and shorter notice, which requires higher inventories. In the quarter that we just \u2013 that \u2013 we saw that dynamic in the fourth quarter of last year. Those inventory levels have generally remained but we haven't seen any significant change. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Olivia Tong : Great. Thanks. Just want to follow up on your comp \u2013 you were discussing about driving growth or creating businesses new categories. And you've obviously shown your ability across your portfolio with that. So can you talk a little bit about what's changed in terms of R&D, your market research processes, your marketing processes, the change in your reporting structure that's driven that change? Are there more people external partnerships? How does the reporting structure potentially change? How does that restructure change help aid that? If you could just dive into that a little bit more that would be great. Thank you. Jon Moeller : That's a big question, Olivia. I'll do my best. First, every category needs to be working to create additional sources of market growth within their \u2013 within the definitions of their existing category and in adjacencies relative to their existing category and that's going to be the predominant source of our growth. And whether that's a fabric enhancer, bead execution, whether that's a laundry single-unit dose execution both of which have significantly inflected market growth rates just as two examples. Some of the initiatives in our Beauty business are doing the same efforts in Power Oral Care as a way to grow markets really across the world. So that is a continuation of what we've been trying to do. And then we've added to that what we call PG Ventures, which is a innovation effort outside of existing categories and we brought products to market like Zevo, which is a natural insecticide. We're working across five or six pretty exciting opportunities that have come out of PG Ventures. That reports to Mary Lynn Ferguson. So it doesn't report into each and every category like she coordinates those efforts for us along with our outside venture partners. From a overall standpoint, whether it's internal innovation to drive superiority to drive market growth or innovation in P&G Ventures, we're operating much more through the lens of lean innovation which simplistically we could spend a day on that. But simplistically is designed to deliver faster, better learning, more shots on goal to increase the chance of breaking through and really having something meaningful to bring to market. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : Thanks, good morning, and congratulations on the strong result. Jon, I want to come back to the U.S. and maybe drill down a little bit on some of the channel dynamics. So obviously another really strong result : organic sales growth up 6% in the U.S. but probably like 3x roughly the market growth rate, which I would estimate is probably closer to 2. And looking at the scanner data that's probably about 300 basis points higher, so it looks like that gap is widening and understanding obviously online is growing quite rapidly. I think it was up mid-20s. I missed it this quarter. I apologize for that. Maybe you could provide us that number. But the questions would be number one any timing benefit that will potentially reverse out in the upcoming quarter? And then maybe spend a little bit of time on discussing some of the channel dynamics between tracked versus non-tracked that would be helpful. Thank you. Jon Moeller : Thanks, Kevin. The tracked number as you know was effectively 3% in the U.S. for the quarter. And as you cited, the overall number was about 6%. That delta is almost entirely due to faster growth rates in non-tracked channels. I mentioned global growth from a e-commerce standpoint at 30%. So customers like Amazon are growing at higher rates than some others. But also for example the club channel is growing at rates that are above the rate of market growth. There are not significant one-timers within the quarter in the U.S. The one significant one-timer that is in our aggregate results is the sell in ahead of the VAT increase, which went into effect on October 1 in Japan. That had about a 30 or 40 basis point impact on our numbers. Operator : And next we'll go to Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : Hi, good morning. Just echoing the congrats. So I was hoping Jon if you can comment a bit more on China where you grew 13%, you accelerated from 12% in the last quarter. But you faced tough comps ahead. So do you think it's -- growth is still driven by SK-II and Olay or is it more broad-based now into hair and other categories? So are you worried about your comps is getting tougher starting in this quarter or -- and related to that you comment on price in baby is still being deflationary. So when do you think you can cycle that process and offset with more premium diapers growth? Thank you. Jon Moeller : We're always concerned about comps getting tougher, always working to run harder. That's a part of the world that we live in. Generally, it is not just for example SK-II and Olay which are growing at fantastic rates in China, but our growth profile across the categories has broadened significantly. You mentioned Baby Care. We were up high single-digits in Baby Care in the quarter very strong response to the innovation that we've brought to market. We are growing generally across the board. The one exception which has improved significantly is Hair Care. In Hair Care, we had very modest growth, but that's an improvement versus where we've been the last couple of quarters. So everything's on the rise in China. I feel -- we feel good about our prospects there. For perspective, if you look at China ex Olay and SK-II, we grew 9% in the quarter. So there is much more to the story than just those two businesses though we're very happy with the story on those two businesses. Operator : All right. Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Grant O'Brien: Hi. This is actually Grant on for Bill. Thanks for taking the question. Just had a quick one on Latin America and in particular Mexico. We've heard from some other companies that the consumer has slowed maybe a little bit there. I was wondering if you were seeing the same thing or any other changes in that market in particular? Thank you. Jon Moeller : We have been seeing something similar. But frankly consumption in the month of September was very strong and we ended up with top line growth rates at very attractive level in Mexico for the last quarter at 10%. Operator : All right. Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Bonnie Herzog : All right. Thank you, good morning. Jon I wanted to circle back on your Beauty business and just really understand how sustainable the strong growth that you're seeing out of that business. How confident you are that this can continue especially as the comps get tougher? Maybe you could help us understand what it will be driven by. Is it better and stronger innovation? If so can you give us some examples maybe of what's been working. And then give us a sense of the levels of innovation in your pipeline this year versus last year. And then finally maybe help us understand why some of your innovation seem to be better resonating with the consumer ultimately driving what I assume to be share gains? Thanks. Jon Moeller : One thing that gives us confidence about continued success in Beauty are the sustainability of the results we've been delivering is the breadth of those results. And I think as I reflect on several of the conversations that we've had together there's a bit of a misunderstanding that it's all driven by SK-II and that just isn't the case. So we grew hair, our Hair Care business mid single-digits in the last quarter. We grew that business at 6% in the U.S. All aspects of our Skin and Personal Care business are growing. Our Personal Care business which is deodorants and body washes and those kinds of products grew at 10% in the quarter. Obviously, Skin Care and SK-II grew at even higher rates than that. If I looked just at SK-II it's one -- it's the fastest-growing part of the portfolio. Our new user attraction continues to be our focus. And as long as we keep that door open, we should continue to grow and that's been happening. But again breadth of success across Beauty. Operator : All right. Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC. Nik Modi : Yeah. Thanks, good morning everyone. Jon I was hoping you can talk about the big dialogue that's been over the last few years, big brands versus small brands. And I was wondering if you could just kind of give us your perspective on this whole next-day same-day delivery battle between Amazon and Walmart and other retailers kind of getting into the fray now. And how that impacts big brands versus small brands in the sense of supply chain integrity and things like that? So maybe you could just give us some thoughts around that dynamic? Jon Moeller : I'm not sure I know Nik exactly what the impact is going to be on those two subsets of businesses, small brands versus large brands directly as a result of what you just described. What I have felt for a long time, what we have felt for a long time and have been talking about for a long time is the relevance -- the continued relevance of large brands, as well as the relevance of small brands in certain instances across our ecosystem. Our large brands historically have grown about 4 points faster than our small brands. And when you look at the absolute growth that comes from that, it's significantly higher. But large -- every large brand started off as a small brand and so we can't ignore that dynamic either. As you know, we've been buying and building some smaller brands to serve some rapidly growing consumer segments particularly in the natural space, but not confined to that. I generally think -- we generally think that the ecosystem as we move forward at minimum does not disadvantage big brands. And I can make pretty strong arguments for why it should advantage big brands. When you think about e-commerce as the fastest growing channel in many -- well certainly in our two largest markets in the U.S. and China and the dynamic of big brands versus small brands in that environment. It disproportionately favors big brands, not at the exclusion of small brands by any means, but certainly doesn't disadvantage big brands. And I'd be happy to talk for hours about that, but I will spare the group that diatribe right here. But generally, we feel that both large brands and small brands will have relevance moving forward. There is nothing structurally or a from a society standpoint that disadvantages big brands particularly and this important when you focus your portfolio on categories where performance drives brand choice. There are very few consumers that sit in front of a physical or virtual shelf and how ask how large a brand is? They're wondering, how well it will to do the job they're buying it to do and will it meet their needs and solve their problems? Operator : Next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy with Macquarie. Caroline Levy : Good morning and thank you very much. Jon I wonder, if you could dive in a little deeper into Grooming and talk about what you found is working, which regions it's working in? And how you think about the future? I mean it's -- is there any opportunity to return to growth in this business for you and what's the plan? Jon Moeller : Definitely, opportunities to return to growth, in fact, we've been growing albeit modestly. Each of the last two quarters we grew on a global basis. If you think about -- I mean, there are number of reasons to be positive going forward. One is, the growth potential that exists in developing markets and the mix potential that exists in those markets as people move up potentially from a double edge or disposables use into systems use. Strong opportunity to further penetrate, though, the double-edge and disposable businesses, particularly in some of the developing markets where for example a lot of the shaves are executed in the context of a barber. So significant opportunities for growth, we're also seeing a very strong response to our newest innovation which is designed to address one of the major barriers to shave and that's skin irritation. And for many men this is a significant issue. This isn't a minor issue. And it literally prevents them from shaving more frequently. So SkinGuard is designed to address that need and increase as a result the frequency of shave and the number of people who do shave. And we've doubled the rate of razor growth with that entry in Europe. If you look at consumer ratings on that product in the U.S., they're very strong. I think they're 4.5, 4.6. And the retailer reaction in terms of space allocation has been very favorable. There are also significant opportunities to address the needs of men who choose not to shave and that's where we're also spending a lot of incremental effort to make sure that we're meeting his needs. And if we do that in a superior way, for both shavers and non-shavers, this category will grow and it's extraordinarily profitable. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI. Robert Ottenstein : Great. Thank you very much. Jon, earlier on I think you mentioned that in aggregate you had seen some pickup in demand, I think, maybe from roughly 3% to 3% to 3.5%. Could you perhaps be -- give us a little bit more detail in terms of which countries you see somewhat better demand than over, let's say, the last 12 months and which categories? Thank you. Jon Moeller : The U.S. is front and center and that's generally across categories, with Grooming being an exception. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jon Andersen with William Blair. Jon Andersen : Hey, thanks. Just a quick one. Personal Healthcare was up double digits in the quarter. You did mention that there was some benefit from presets by retailers about the cough-cold season. How much of a benefit was that? I mean, was that just kind of a comp issue relative to last year? Are they planning for a stronger season this year? And then if you could talk briefly about the integration of the Merck business. Jon Moeller : Acquisition of -- or integration of the Merck business is going very well and a quick thank you to all those who are involved in that effort. We continue to grow that business at very attractive rates and continue to grow our heritage P&G Personal Healthcare business at very attractive rates. As you said, the total grew double digits in the quarter. If anything, if my knowledge is correct, it may not be, but if anything we saw, a slower buy in ahead of the season of this year as compared to, for example, last year, but certainly not a significant impact either way. Operator : And your final question comes from the line of Edward Lewis with Atlantic Equities. Edward Lewis : Yes. Thanks very much. I just wanted to drill down into Europe, because I guess you're close to start where you suggests all geographic regions are growing at 4% or more. I guess, Europe's included with that. And, I guess, things really haven't been that great of late. So I was just wondering, it's a tougher operating environment. You've got lots of regions to survey or to execute against. And you've rolled out the -- your focus on superiority and end-to-end SBU strategy a bit later. But it does seems as though the market share trends and the underlying growth rate seems to be improving over here as well. Jon Moeller : Europe is definitely included in the characterization of all regions growing at 4% or more. Our big focus markets in Europe grew at 4% during the quarter. The more developing parts of Europe grew at 5% during the quarter. Really broad growth across countries within Europe : Germany, for example, up 6%; Russia up 5%; the combination of France and the U.K. up 2% to 3%. So we're seeing certainly growth ahead of the market in Europe. We built share -- our share position very nicely over the past 12, six, three and one-month period. So we're very happy with our performance there. Jon Moeller : I want to thank everybody. I know this is a busy morning with a number of companies reporting, so thank you for your time. John, Katie and I are available the balance of the day to answer any questions that you have to the best of our ability. Thanks a lot. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning and welcome to Procter & Gamble's Quarter End Conference Call. P&G would like to remind you that today's discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections. Also as required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business trends and has posted on its Investor Relations website www.pginvestor.com a full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Now, I will turn the call over to P&G's Vice Chairman, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller. Jon Moeller : Good morning. As this was another relatively straightforward quarter, and as David Taylor will be with us to provide additional depth at CAGNY in just a few weeks. I'm going to keep prepared remarks this morning brief, turning fairly quickly to your questions. This was another very solid quarter, top line, bottom line and cash driven by our portfolio superiority, productivity, constructive disruption and organization strategies. Organic sales up 5%, three points of volume growth, two points of price mix. Two-year stack average growth of 4.5%, fiscal year-to-date organic sales growth of 6%, calendar year 2019 organic growth of 6%. This growth continues to be broad based. Nine of 10 global categories grew organic sales, Skin and Personal Care up double digits, Personal Health Care and Home Care grew high singles, Fabric Care, Feminine Care, Hair Care, Oral Care and Grooming grew mid-single digits. Family Care grew low singles. Focus markets and enterprise markets each grew mid singles. We continue to perform very well in our two largest markets, the US up 4% and China up 13% for the quarter, aggregate market share continuing to grow. These results required us to overcome several challenges. While we're seeing real signs of progress with Grooming organic sales up 4% this quarter, we're still working to sustainably improve results in this business and in Baby Care. Sales results in Japan, our third largest market, created nearly a half point drag on total company organic sales growth due to the timing of VAT changes that went into effect on October 1. The timing as we highlighted last quarter, led to higher shipments last quarter and lower shipments in the quarter we just completed. We faced market level challenges in an increasing number of markets, India, the UK, Australia, Turkey, Iraq, Nigeria, Kenya, Lebanon, Argentina, Chile, Mexico and the Hong Kong market. Through all of this, we grew organic sales 5% on the quarter and 6% over the first half. Moving to the bottom line, core earnings per share were up 14% versus the prior year. Foreign Exchange was a one point earnings growth headwind, so on a constant currency basis core earnings per share increased 15%. Fiscal year-to-date core earnings per share are up 18%, up 19% on a constant currency basis. Gross margin up 200 basis points in the second quarter, core operating margin up 190 basis points, continued strong cash generation, with operating cash flow of $4.4 billion and free cash flow productivity of 100%. $1.9 billion of dividends paid, $3.5 billion of P&G stock repurchased, $5.4 billion of cash returned to shareholders. We'd another strong quarter, solid volume sales and market share trends across both categories and geographies. Strong operating earnings, margins advancing, strong core earnings per share growth and continued high levels of cash generated and returned to shareholders. We continue to face the challenges of a very volatile macro and geopolitical landscape and of competitive response to our growth. But all in we're continuing to make progress behind a set of integrated and mutually reinforcing strategies. The strategic choices we've made to focus and strengthen our portfolio in daily use categories where performance drives brand choice. We establish and extend the superiority of our brands. To make productivity as integral to our culture as innovation, to lead constructive disruption across the value chain and to improve organization focus, agility and accountability, reinforce and build on each other. They position as well within our industry to deal with near term macro and competitive challenges. They are the foundation for stronger balanced growth and value creation over the short, mid and long term. Moving to guidance, we're again increasing our fiscal year outlook for organic sales growth, for core earnings per share growth and for free cash flow productivity, as well as cash return. We started the year with organic sales growth guidance of 3% to 4%. We increased the range to 3% to 5% last quarter and are now increasing the range to 4% to 5%. This 4% to 5% range compares with underlying market growth of 3% to 4%, implying continued market share growth. On the bottom line our core earnings per share growth guidance started the year at a range of 4% to 9%. We raised the range to 5% to 10% last quarter and we're now increasing the range again to 8% to 11% for the year. We're increasing our outlook for adjusted free cash flow productivity from 90% going into the year to 95% last quarter and now to 100%. We'll extend our long track record of significant cash generation and cash returned expecting to pay over $7.5 billion in dividends and now increasing our outlook for share repurchase from a range of $6 billion to $8 billion to a range of $7 billion to $8 billion in fiscal 2020. While we've delivered strong first half results, please keep in mind that comps get more difficult as we move through the year, both top line and bottom line. Pricing annualizes as we move through the back half of the year affecting both top and bottom line trends. We'll comp the earnings gains from the Boston landfill and Oral Care brand divestitures in Q4. Competitors are responding to our outperformance, which will require continued innovation and equity building investments on our part. And the market level challenges I mentioned earlier will be top and bottom line headwinds for the balance of the year. Our guidance is based on current market growth rates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates, significant currency weakness, commodity cost increases or additional geopolitical disruptions are not included within the new and improved guidance ranges. We look forward to seeing many of you at the CAGNY conference in just a few weeks. As I mentioned, David Taylor will join us and we'll provide further perspective on forward looking strategies and plans. We look forward to engaging with you into benefiting from your thoughts and reactions. With that I'm happy to take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : Hey Jon, I want to just focus on organic sales growth obviously the 5% results still very healthy this quarter, but it is below 7% in each of the prior two quarters. It sounds like some of that's Japan timing based on the prepared remarks. I'm assuming perhaps the US inventory reductions as the retailer's approach fiscal year end. So just want to get your read on an underlying basis looking at retail sales growth and shipment timing ex inventory changes, has anything changed in terms of the underlying momentum as you look at the fiscal Q2 results versus the last couple of quarters. And then within that answer, perhaps you can just touch briefly on the competitive environment. Have you seen incremental promotion with the recent commodity pullback, and also give us an update on China performance in the quarter and any impact so far from the virus that we're seeing over there? Thanks. Jon Moeller : I could complete the whole call there. On the first part of your question, we're very pleased with the top line growth in the quarter that we just completed. As you all know, we delivered 7% as you mentioned in the prior quarter, our guidance was three to five for the full fiscal year, implying something below that beyond the first quarter, and we delivered at the high end of that range. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks that growth was broad based both across categories and regions. And we built market share. From an underlying consumption standpoint, you've seen the uptick numbers, at least through December, which continue to be very strong. And we really haven't seen anything that would cause us to change that outlook kind of first part of the current quarter. So all the fundamentals are there, our superiority levels continue to increase, we're investing behind that while building margins. We're building market share and increasingly the growth is broader as you look at both categories and geographies. We did have some headwinds in the quarter from two items. You mentioned probably three. You mentioned one which is Japan and that had a half point impact which benefited the prior quarter. The other dynamic has been a series and I mentioned this also in my prepared remarks of geopolitical, economic, societal and other impacts in individual markets. I mean, think about what's happened in the last \u2013 well, since we last gathered even. The situation in the Hong Kong market has continued to be difficult, which had a real impact on the quarter and had an impact on the travel retail business. Some of the market level events in South America whether that's Argentina or Chile, where stores were burnt and are not yet back in place. Some of the events that you're very familiar with in our headline items in the Middle East impacted our business as well. And those items will impact us going forward for the balance of the year. I'm very \u2013 we're very pleased that we were able to overcome all of that, and still deliver very strong numbers that built share and build household penetration and allow us to deliver significant bottom line benefits. From a competitive environment standpoint which was the second part of your question. Promotion levels \u2013 percentage of sales in our category sold and promotion are actually down. The index at 98 for the last quarter, that's all I have visibility to. I don't have visibility to the future. And where individual competitors are up versus year ago, they're up typically a point. So very simply and we can get into this later with others if you want more detail. We're not seeing competitive activity that's indicative of downward price spirals by any means. That can change tomorrow, but what we have in front of us today continues to look very healthy. China, we are very optimistic about our prospects in China. It's a difficult market. It moves at a very fast pace both of our consumer and trade channel standpoint. But we continue to increase the rate of growth in that market. You'll recall four years ago, we were at minus one. The following year, we were at plus seven, fusing plus \u2013 minus five, plus one, plus seven, last year plus 10 and fiscal year-to-date of plus 13. So that continues to be a very attractive market within that some really strong growth rates in some categories. I'm talking the high 20% in categories like Skin Care, Feminine Care over 20%, Fabric Care double digits, so generally a very strong market. I have no idea what the developments are going to be relative to the new virus. We're obviously monitoring that closely as it relates both to the health of our employees and broader communities. And we'll have to see what impact that has, if any, on whether this was going forward. But it's one of those things that I do think it's important to mention because it can have broad impacts well beyond China. It can also affect consumer confidence in large parts of the market. It can affect travel, which does affect our business. And so it's one of the many pieces of volatility that's just important we keep front of us as we think about the prospects for the future which I view is generally extremely positive, but not without risking without challenge. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Steve Strycula with UBS. Steve Strycula : Hi, good morning. So Jon, I'll stick to one topic here. And just to clarify one of your responses. The slowdown you're seeing in travel retail is that specific to Hong Kong or is it a little bit broader based in China. That would be a quick clarification. And the broader question would be can you talk to just what we're seeing across the global beauty spectrum in the portfolio right now, how is China performing with SK-II versus Olay and then what is the opportunity to extend SK-II to broader markets looking forward? Thank you. Jon Moeller : Another three parter, I'll try to get to each of the pieces efficiently. Travel retail concentrated in Hong Kong. Beauty broadly continues to do extremely well. This is our 17th consecutive quarter of growth with Q2 up 8%. That growth is broad based. Healthcare grew 6% of the quarter. Our Skin and Personal business grew to 10%. It was actually a relatively slow quarter for SK-II given both the VAT dynamic in Japan where SK-II has a big business and the Hong Kong dynamics. Skin Care broadly in China, as I mentioned, is doing extraordinarily well. Olay was up strong, strong double digits. And \u2013 but the balance of the business as well. Our Safeguard business, which is part of our beauty, grew double digits, again strong double digits over 20%. So the growth in beauty both on a global basis and within the China market is broad based. I think you asked another question, but I'd don't \u2013 SK-II expansion. Yeah. There are \u2013 so first of all, there are significant opportunities in the markets that we're in as evidenced by the current growth rates. There are also the right time and in the right way, expansion opportunities available. Are there other questions? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JP Morgan. Andrea Teixeira : Hi, good morning, everyone. Thank you. I just want to double click on what you just said on the China \u2013 from the China, how it evolved for the quarter and if you're baking any more level of conservatism into the backend of the year given what happened recently. So I think what you also discuss is Hair Care coming back, so you've got a gating effect from what could be expected in a continuation and all the deceleration for SK-II. Thank you. Jon Moeller : Let me first talk about Hair Care and I'm assuming the questions is in the China context. We grew Hair Care in the mid to high single digits in China, which is the fastest growth rate in a period of time. And so yes, that can offer some offsets if you will to other businesses that may soften to competitive activity or other things. On the other hand, the Hair Care business is a highly, highly competitive business as are many other categories. So the dynamics can change there quite rapidly. Our job is to continue to steadily increase our margin of superiority. And if we do that, over time, if not quarter-to-quarter, we'll continue to have a strong business. In terms of the conservatism in the back half of the year, I'll answer this question both relative to China which obviously we don't provide specific guidance for and the balance of the company. One thing to keep in mind with China is the timing of Chinese New Year, which is, you know, from all the press on China recently is happening beginning as we speak. And that is earlier in the calendar year than it typically occurs. And so it's likely there was some sell in the OMD period that wouldn't have been there and the prior period. But on a global P&G basis that doesn't move the needle significantly, but something just to be aware of as relates to the China specific situation. I talked in my prepared remarks about some of the headwinds that exist that increase there in the quarter and will impact us in the back half of the year or could impact us in the back half of the year. We talked about the market level dynamics. So if you take a market that may not be that large, but take a market like Chile. That impact happened at the very end of the quarter, and will exist through the balance of the year. The same with, for example, the situation in Lebanon, the same for the situation in Iraq, the Indian market, the growth rates have slowed, still growing and we're doing very well and building chair. But the challenges there have increased and will likely remain for the balance of the year. So that's one reason, one thing that needs to be netted against to strong progress that we hope to continue to make. The other is the annualization of price increases. So for example, in February, we annualize both a Dish Care price increase from year ago and a Family Care price increase from a year ago. And I don't want to talk about how we're going to handle pricing going forward. That's kind of off limits. But regardless though the annualization impacts as well as some of the price increases we've taken for evaluation over the last year will annualize. And third is the competitive environment. And I don't know what that's going to hold. I've described what it's held so far. But most of our calendars \u2013 most of our competitors are calendar year based. They start their new fiscal years as we speak. And many of them have talked, understandably, about increasing investments for growth. That can be a very healthy thing. It can grow categories, we can all benefit from that. But certain implementations of that obviously are less healthy. Now, against all of that backdrop, we continue to make progress on the things that we control or making very strong progress, our margin of superiority is increasing across the board. It's dynamic, it's not static. So we have moves forward and moves back, but the net move is a forward move. We're in a position because of our productivity programs to invest to support communication of that superiority. And that's really driving some outsized growth in many of our categories. And over time and it will take some time. I expect we'll deliver higher growth rates on businesses like Baby Care. So overall, we're very optimistic about where we stand today and what the future holds, at least in the near term, but it would be irresponsible not to acknowledge the challenges that exist. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Great, thanks. Good morning. I'm going to ask one question. And I just wanted to talk a little bit about Grooming and particularly shaving. And you'd mentioned there were still some devaluation driven pricing. And I just was curious if you could talk about performance to the business to specific to developed markets, and how things are trending the impact of Gillette sensitive, you've made some portfolio moves, right. There's been several already been apart, you've just acquired Billie. So you can maybe give us a little bit of lay of the land there how you're chipping away and making progress or not so much in shave care would be great. Jon Moeller : Thanks Lauren. And within that one question you've managed to ask three which is very well done. Our Grooming business strengthened in the quarter overall, we were up 4% and that's the third consecutive quarter of growth. Importantly, we grew global market share point three points, which is very encouraging. Shaving within that was up versus year ago, not as much as \u2013 I mean not as much as the dry shave business, but the wet shave business did grow. And we've seen pretty strong response to our investments both in products in and communication. Encouragingly, we've added 18 million new users to our brands over the last 12 months. SkinGuard is contributing to category growth; it's doing well and continues to expand. In the US, for example, razor value share on SkinGuard is now 9%, which is a third largest for a P&G sub brand. And we're building unlike most of our competitors our shave business online. We're pretty excited about the Billie acquisition. That's something that obviously needs to pass regulatory clearance. And we need to remain separate from that business until that happens. But there's a real unique set of skills, experiences and knowledge between Billie and P&G that we think has the potential to create some real magic. Clearly, they've created very effectively a fresh new brand that extends across several categories. And they've done it and we can benefit from their experience on this in a digital fashion with one-to-one mass marketing, which is something we're continuing to increase our focus on and capabilities related to. We have innovation capability across the majority of their categories. We have best in class manufacturing across the majority of their categories. And we have a go-to-market presence, both online and brick-and-mortar, certainly in omni channel that can accelerate the growth in that business. So we're very excited about the potential and are working through the clearance process. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Ali Dibadj : Hey, I think \u2013 I wanted to ask in more detail your view about the future on pricing for kind of the future solidness of some of recent price increases globally given there is starting to be just like Jon competitive murmurs of more investments coming. You know, like most recently Exedy [ph] in Europe, yesterday's really talking about pricing, and commodities clearly continue to fall. Again, you're not seeing anything yet. But within that context, two questions. One is what kind of lead time notice you get in terms of price competition? So can you feel comfortable saying it's all clear for a quarter or it's clear for two quarters, or just like literally this may change tomorrow? And then the second thing is part of our cost of jobs is pattern recognition. And so historically, we have seen that prices, this increased rate's been on everything down in categories, especially maybe in Family, with these types of commodity decline. Do you think this time is different and if so kind of why? So there's a technical question on timing, and there's more of a, how do you see the go for given the patterns we've seen it for. Thank you. Jon Moeller : Thanks, Ali. Obviously, just related to Exedy first, they're talking about a market that we're not competing in. I know that you know that. That is a very different market. It's much more of a commodity market than our primary market from a talent standpoint, which is what I believe they were talking about, which is North America. In general, we see commodity prices as supportive of the current prices in the market. So while they're down some versus kind of historical levels and where we were before the price increases went into effect, we feel the current prices are justified that does not speak to an indication of future activity, I won't go there. And our outlook for those commodities continues to be relatively flat to slight increases, particularly in the in the pulse space. But I don't see the kind of sea change environment that would necessitate activity. Having said that each competitor will do what they choose to do and we need to be responsive to that which gets to your second question. And candidly, we do not have advance notice of the implementation of price increases. And so we are \u2013 decreases sorry, either one. And so we react as we see those in the marketplace. And that reaction time, typically is anywhere from a quarter to six months. So if we think along a reasonable period of time. I don't expect this to be a crippling dynamic or anything resembling that going forward and may cause a quarter of two of odd benefit or hurt, but not a big thing to worry about. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citi. Wendy Nicholson : Hi. Unlike some of your peers who have had less margin expansion and your margin trends have been terrific. And a lot of that seems to been driven by the productivity initiatives. I know you're kind of coming. Are you in your felt for maybe of your five year program? And I'm just wondering, what's your outlook, not for the next quarter, but sort of for the next two to three years? Is there another $10 billion restructuring program coming or how do you keep this productivity benefits accruing when you come into the end of the program. Thanks Jon Moeller : Thanks, Wendy. I mentioned as one of our strategic choices, the desire to make productivity as integral to our nature, as innovation, and be leaders in productivity just as we are in innovation. And I think we've made a lot of progress on that journey, as you rightly point out, which is reflected in our margins certainly this quarter. My hope is that as we move forward, this is simply an integral part of our operating strategy. And it needs to be because we will need to continue to invest in \u2013 of holding advancing our margin of superiority. Some of the continuous disruption we're talking about will also require some investment that's in human resources, capital, et cetera. And I feel very good about each of the business units understanding and commitment to continue delivering productivity. So that brings us to another part of the question which is, are there degrees of freedom that enable that to occur? Will is one thing, delivery is another. And I don't think we've ever been in a place where there are more degrees of freedom or more opportunities to improve productivity, the tools that we have available to us now across the digital spectrum and that's everywhere from marketing to the manufacturing floor to the office environment, had never offered more opportunity than they do today. And we have significant opportunities still in terms of how we think about our new organization structure and other opportunities within that as we learn more about it to become even more efficient and effective and I certainly believe they are \u2013 there are. I just attended along with David, a review of our product supply innovation program last week, and there are big opportunities relative to robotics, relative to a tighter sequencing of the entire supply chain from order signal all the way back to delivery where the middle of a sustainable product supply transformation across markets and geographies. So I continue to believe that productivity will be an inherent part of our operating strategy and we have the tools and opportunities to continue to deliver that. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Olivia Tong : Great, thanks, good morning. I want to talk a little bit about advertising because that continues to move up 150 basis points this quarter. And at this point, I think there's a fair bit of investment already in the base. So was that always applying to continue to increase? Or is this more optimistic than you expected? Was it \u2013 is there anything that you need to defend? Because obviously, you said that we haven't seen that much of a change in percent of sales goals on promos. So just wondering where that advertising dollar is going towards? Thank you. Jon Moeller : A couple of things there Olivia, we've been very clear. I think that while we need to be competitive in the trade spending standpoint and need to offer attractive margins to our retail partners, where we have a degree of flexibility, we would prefer to spend that incremental dollar on advertising or innovation every day of the week. The reason is very simple. There's nothing proprietary and pricing, we can build proprietary advantage with both advertising and innovation. So again, on the margin, where we have the opportunity to make those shifts, we're doing it. And we're doing it in a way that is attractive to our retail partners as well because it drives business and grows categories. The second piece we've talked a lot about, and Marc Pritchard, our Chief Marketing Officer has talked a lot about externally is the opportunity to move what were historically a significant amount of non-working dollars into working and advertising. And that's been about a billion dollar shift and it continues. And the third piece of this is when you have innovation that's noticeably superior. You need to want to ensure would be communicating that superiority and those performance benefits and the value that comes with them to consumers. And the good news is we have a lot of very strong innovation in the marketplace that has a lot of legs left in terms of either just launched or something like paws or beads which have been on the market for a number of years that have significant household penetration opportunities and our pure delighters from a consumption standpoint. We want to be supporting those. I mentioned both as relates to competitive activity, but also in general that we will continue to invest in both equity and innovation as we move forward. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : Good morning Jon. Congratulations on another strong quarter. Can we come back to China which was particularly strong in the quarter against a notably difficult comparison? Can you delineate a bit the company's progress in that market between category strength and superior Proctor market share performance and maybe how that's changed? You talk about Skin Care, obviously very strong up 20%. Fem Care, I think was up double digits. Maybe just talk a little bit about how much of this is category versus strategic execution by Proctor in certain categories and then your expectations here for the balance of the year? Thanks. Jon Moeller : Thanks Kevin. It's honestly hard to separate those because if we do our job right from an execution standpoint and an innovation standpoint of a growth, we grow markets, so we don't view market growth as something that is separate from our efforts. It's in many cases, obviously not 100%. But it's caused by our efforts. I realized that's not that helpful to you, but it's an important point. As we back up from that and I look at category growth in China, it continues to be strong in our categories. The one area that's under a little bit of pressure from a category growth stand point is Baby Care and that relates to the birth rates, which have gone from about 15 million babies a year down to 10, which is significant impact. On the other hand, within that category, there are significant premiumization opportunities and the premium part of our business is growing 20% or 30%, depending on whether that's premium tape diapers or pants style diapers, but in general and China the answer on category growth is remains very strong. The answer on if you will P&Gs specific efforts if you pretend for a second that they're not impacting category growth that also is abundant and real. I mean, we've gone \u2013 it's not that the inflection in category growth rate that has changed the results on Skin Care, it's our share of progress within the category, albeit in a very growth full category. So we've gone from declines, perennial declines on that business to perennial gains and strong double digit gains. The improvement in our Hair Care top line is still not what we'd like it to be but definitely improved from where we've been. Is a result of much stronger branding and innovation efforts as well as go-to-market strengthening, so it's hard for me to fuse those apart? The simple answer is it's both and that's a good thing. Operator : Your next question will come from the mind of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Hey, good morning, folks and Happy New Year. Two questions for me. First on US growth, you mentioned 4%. Obviously, solid in context of the US, but it is a decel from last quarter and it comes despite an easier comp. Is there anything worth calling out any nuance to take note of there on that growth? And then secondly, on the Baby, Fem and Family Care segment, growth was a little weaker than we expected this quarter. It's kind of bleak as we've seen in a while. I know this has been one business, it's been a little harder for you to kind of get going like everything else. Can you walk us through what the game plan is and what our expectations should be for that business as we think about the next 12 months? Thank you. Jon Moeller : I'll start where you started. US growth of 4% is indeed very strong and it's building market share. We built market share in the US over the past three, six and 12 months periods. Nine of our 10 categories grew in the US in the last quarter. The one that didn't was either at a 98.5 or 99.5 index. The difference between the quarters reflects a number of things. Part of it is trade inventory, which was reduced as we went through the second quarter. There's initiative timing that impacts this pretty significantly as well. I would expect going forward we're going to continue to see some chop, if we look at it on a quarter-to-quarter basis. But across a slightly longer period of time, we remain very, very happy with the way the business is progressing. And if we look at underlying consumption going back to a discussion earlier in this call that continues to be as you've seen, at least the scanner data, very, very strong. From a Baby Care standpoint, if you look at the first half of the year, Baby Care was flat to up slightly which is a better position we've been in. And it ranges from \u2013 if we look at our two largest markets, China and the US, those are relatively \u2013 again on a relative basis healthy. China in the first half, we grew at 5%. That's the fastest growth where we've had from \u2013 on a semester basis in about six years. We regain market share leadership about two years ago and have continued to hold that. As I mentioned, in the last answer, we're growing our premium business our pants business, very, very strongly. The US we're about flat versus year ago, which again, is an improvement on a relative basis. And what should take both of those businesses as well as the broader Baby Care business to a stronger position is innovation which builds superiority. We have across parts of the portfolio, not been offering a superior product. It's larger than some of those cases of parody product. We have strong innovation plans in place not only in terms of eco mentality, but we really increase the pace of innovation and the amount that's coming to market, a lot of which has driven the China results that I talked about. But innovation, whether it's a Baby Care or Beauty Care, it's not an overnight endeavor and we'll continue to hopefully, improve sequentially as we go forward. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark Astrachan : Thanks and good morning, everybody. I guess maybe just a quick question for you, Jon. The enterprise versus rest of business seems to slow down a little bit. You guys don't really talk about EM versus DM kind of anymore, but maybe talk a bit about what has driven the slowdown you touched on Chile, Hong Kong, et cetera. How much is that in terms of country specific issues versus laughing the pricing and kind of happy to be thinking about that dynamic on a go forward basis? Jon Moeller : We're pretty pleased with the growth rates in the enterprise markets currently. We mentioned mid-single digits. It's really at the border of mid-single digits and high single digits. I'll leave you with that. And that's despite these pretty significant impacts. If you think about two of the largest markets in the enterprise environment are India and Mexico, and I talked about the slowing growth rates in India, largely as a result of some of the monetary policies, which has created a bit of a liquidity squeeze, which is drying up inventory through the system. But we continue to grow well in India and are building share. Mexico's technically, from an economic growth standpoint, in a recession. We continue to grow reasonably well there. We have been single digits and are growing share there as well. So broadly, we continue to be pretty pleased with our progress. And just briefly, even though it wasn't part of your question on the bottom line, we're creating more value in these markets currently then we ever have. So our bottom line progress was strong double digits, well ahead of the company average. We need to be focused on value creation in these markets that includes growth where we can generate a meaningful return and that's what we're focused on doing and there's tons of opportunity. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI. Robert Ottenstein : Great, thank you, Jon. I'd like to kind of focus on ecommerce. I think in the past, you've said that it's about 8% of sales is that moved up maybe closer to 10? And globally, how fast is it growing on a global basis, then specifically how fast in China, how fast in the US and are you gaining share in ecommerce in China and the US? Thank you. Jon Moeller : It continues to be a significant opportunity for growth. It's currently growing at about 30%. And in the big ecommerce markets, well, that growth differs across categories. It's pretty much at that level across markets. It is now about 10% of our total business. And what I \u2013 just for clarity when I mention ecommerce, I'm talking obviously the totality of ecommerce which includes omni channel. And our market share in general has been increasing. Of course, there's some volatility to that, but particularly in a china context and again it differs by category. We've been making significant progress in that space, so I see us as very well positioned to succeed in that space, though that's something that requires eternal efforts, flexibility and the constructive disruption of ourselves which we're committed to, to ensure that we offer a competitive and relevant offering, wherever consumers want to shop, whether that's ecommerce, whether that's large format or that's small format. And generally, we're progressing well in each of those. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Nik Modi with RBC. Nik Modi : Yes. Good morning. Thanks, everyone. Jon, maybe you can talk a little bit about the Merck OTT business. I mean, health care of was a pretty nice contributor to the top line. So just wanted to understand what's driving that business, kind of what's the strategy there? Any context would be helpful. Thanks. Jon Moeller : As you probably recall, Merck offers a very complimentary portfolio to our legacy Personal Healthcare P&G business. Has a strong presence in the developing world, complimentary categories across geographies and there were significant we felt cost synergies in addition to revenue synergies by bringing the best of both companies together and driving growth. It's early days, we're still in the middle of integrating we just closed 18 months ago, but we're very pleased with the results so far. This is the first quarter in which Merck has recorded as part of our organic sales growth rates. It contributed positively to that. It's a real asset to our overall Personal Healthcare business and it's playing out that way. The revenue synergies are on track, the cost synergies are on track with some real exciting examples of the possibility of driving both of those ahead of what our initial plans had that. The organization is a strong organization and they're doing a great job, so, so far really, really good. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Bill Chappell : Thanks, good morning. Jon, just circling back to the Billie acquisition, just a little surprised that I guess P&G thinks that that can pass with the FTC and just with your market share and also with kind of FTC cracking down on it a lot of even recent small acquisitions historically. So kind of any thoughts there on why you're moving forward with that and especially on the US positioning. And then if that's part of a plan, and do you think you got more opportunities to do tuck-ins to where you have 40-50 share of a market? Jon Moeller : In general, just starting from the strategic level, we want to ensure that we are serving consumers in all relevant segments of the categories that we've chosen to plan. Sometimes, that's easier and more straightforward from an organic standpoint, so if you think about the natural segment, for example, something like Pampers Pure, on the other hand, getting a quick presence in some of these high growth segments or with different groups of consumers, it's sometimes easier to do the acquisition. So if I just \u2013 a good example of this is L on Feminine Care, which is now the number one natural product from a market share standpoint, obviously, very early, but so far has proven to be very strong idea to expand in a very relevant consumer segment very quickly. That's the motivation here. I'm obviously not going to speak to regulatory dynamics or anything related to that. But we're excited about this and we're hopeful we have the opportunity to really work to grow this combined set of categories grow the market and create value. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse. Kaumil Gajrawala : Hi, good morning. Jon, can you talk a little bit about how you and the board think about valuation in the context of share buybacks. Your results are obviously the best that they've been probably in a decade, but so is the -- appropriately so as the value of your shares. So can you just talk a little bit about valuation in buy back context? Jon Moeller : Sure, obviously, over the last decade, buybacks have created extraordinary value. But that's been on the back, which is implicit in your question on overtime a significant increase in the stock price. If I look at it today, first of all we don't try to forecast where the market's going to go. We don't pretend that we know that. And so, in general, we feel very strongly about our prospects as a company. There's no reason at present not to feel reasonably good about the market itself and so we're kind of, if you will, dollar cost averaging over time. The other thing that's important, though, is to think about the context of our dividend yield relative to financing rates that are available. Because at some level what you're dealing with is, can I retire a dividend rate with an incremental financing cost that's lower than that rate? And with negative interest rates in many parts of the world, this is a very attractive time to be, if you will, financing share repurchase, we're going to stay within our credit limits as we do that. That's another constraint, if you will, or another rail and we'll continually look at this. Obviously, capital allocation is a broad topic inclusive of every purchase is something that is reviewed regularly with the board and we value their input to that, but the current plan obviously reflects that as we sit here today, I don't have a reason to suggest a change in that plan. Operator : And your final question will come from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge. Jonathan Feeney : Hey, Jon, thank you. Are you concerned at all that your business has become more macro sensitive in the past five to 10 years, in some segments of outsized growth would seem to indicate that, but any historical context or consumer data you have that a farmer to spell that I'd appreciate? Jon Moeller : I think Jon we're actually less sensitive into the macro environment. And that's been a very deliberate choice we've made. Let me explain that. We were in as we went into the last recession as an example, a lot of \u2013 for a number of relatively to highly discretionary product categories. Things like salon hair color, high end premium fragrance, just two examples. And our intentional and strategic part of our portfolio focus was to be instead in daily use categories that are used in good times and bad times because they're just important to get through the day, sometimes multiple use is important to get through the day. So if you look at the total portfolio through that lens, we're more macro resilient, I would argue today than we were some years ago. The second reason I say that is the efforts that we've made and will continue to make and the investment we've put behind it on product superiority, product package, the whole set of drivers that inherently increases consumer value. So the value of each purchase is higher than it would have been even inclusive of small price increases. And that too puts us in a better position relative to things like trade down that can happen as a result of macro dynamics and more difficult economic times. Not immune, but in a better position today. The third thing I would argue is to the extent that we've been successful, and creating a culture where productivity is as integral to our being as innovation. We have more financial flexibility and therefore more degrees of freedom. For how we manage the difficulties that the macro economic situation can present. So for those three reasons Jon I think we're going to \u2013 a much better place today. We will be impacted if there are negative developments in any part of the world. It does create challenge. It's the right question to continue to ask. And I'm not talking in absolutes, but on a relative basis, we're much more macro resilient than I think we were historically. Great, well, thanks everybody again, just a quick summary. We really view this quarter as another step in our journey forward. Strong top line progress, building market share, strong operating earnings growth, building margins, strong core earnings per share, generating cash, returning back cash to shareholders all behind an integrated strategy that's working and we will continue to execute. We look forward to seeing many of you, as I said earlier at CAGNY and I look forward to our conversations. Thanks. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning and welcome to Procter & Gamble\u2019s Quarter End Conference Call. P&G would like to remind you that today\u2019s discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G\u2019s most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the Company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from these projections. Also, as required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the Company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business trends and has posted on its Investor Relations website www.pginvestor.com a full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Now, I will turn the call over to P&G\u2019s Vice Chairman, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller. Jon Moeller : Good morning. I\u2019m here at home by myself coming to you through my cell phone. John Chevalier is at his home and is prepared to jump in if for any reason my connection fails and I can\u2019t reestablish it. We\u2019re all going through a difficult and challenging time. And I want to start by expressing our sincere hope that you and your families are safe and are well. Thank you for joining us on accelerated timing. Our motivation in advancing the timing of this release was simply transparency, giving information to you and to the market as quickly as possible. We\u2019ve had a very strong quarter, but I\u2019m going to start by outlining our priorities in the crisis period. These have been and will continue to guide our actions and our choices. I\u2019ll then move quickly to strategy, which remains unwavering. I\u2019ll discuss actual and potential results for three time periods, the quarter we just completed, which as I said was strong; the long-term on the backside of this crisis; and then, the short to midterm as we all work our way through this. Following this, I\u2019ll answer a couple of anticipated questions and then turn to additional questions that are on your or your clients\u2019 minds. Our first priority in this crisis is to ensure the health and safety of the men and women we work with, our colleagues around the world. Second, we\u2019re maximizing the availability of products that help people and their families with their health hygiene and cleaning needs, which has never been greater. The next priority is helping society meet and overcome the challenges we all face. Taken together, these priorities help ensure P&G is there, there for employees, there for consumers, there for communities who have always been there for us. Let me briefly discuss each of these priorities in turn. Employee safety and health. With guidance from medical professionals, we\u2019re constantly evaluating and updating the robust measures already in place to help our people who are making packing and shipping P&G products stay safe at work. This includes temperature scans, shift rotations, queuing avoidance and physical distancing. We\u2019re performing comprehensive methodical cleaning of all production areas including regular sanitization and surface disinfection that exceeds the most rigorous health authority standards. We\u2019re also equipping and encouraging all employees to make smart appropriate choices, such as staying at home if they feel unwell or part of high risk groups or have preexisting medical conditions. In all cases, we\u2019re partnering with our colleagues individually and proactively to ensure they feel and are protected and safe. This has never been more important as many of our facilities are running around the clock to deliver P&G products during this period of increased demand. Our industry-leading benefits plans play a critical role in providing P&G people with the resources they need to care for themselves and for their families. From paid leave and comprehensive medical care to flexible work arrangements and financial support, P&G people can work confidently knowing that the Company stands with and behind them. It\u2019s been very inspiring to witness the many actions service people are taking to support and care for each other, demonstrating creativity, flexibility and commitment, truly P&G people at their best. Turning to product availability. P&G products play an essential role in helping consumers maintain proper hygiene, personal health and healthy home environments. Our products clean your laundry, your home, your hair, your body, your hands, and we clean and shave your face. We provide hygiene products for feminine protection, Baby Care, adult incontinence and bathroom needs. Hair Care, shampoos to clean hair and conditioners and treatments to improve hair health. Facial cleansers, body wash, hand soaps and antiperspirants deodorants address additional hygiene needs. Our OTC health care products provide proactive health benefits as well as important symptom relief. These products are more important than ever, given the needs presented by the current crisis. The increased awareness around health and hygiene and the additional time we\u2019re all spending -- many of us are spending at home. Consumption of hand soaps has obviously increased. Consumers in the U.S. are doing more laundry loads per week and washing more garments after wearing them just once. More loads are being done with unit dose detergents. We\u2019ve seen a spike in demand for Tide antibacterial spray. This care consumption has increased as families eat more meals at home and are more concerned about the hygiene of their dishes, glasses and silverware. More meals at home means more surface cleaning, often with a preference for a disposable cleaning solution versus a funky sponge, dingy cloth or suspect mop, leading to increased consumption of Bounty Swiffer and Mr. Clean. In late February, we launched Microban 24, an antimicrobial technology that keeps surfaces sanitized for up to 24 hours, when used as directed. The power behind Microban 24 is a multilayer protective shield that binds the bacteria-fighting ingredient to the surface that\u2019s been cleaned, even when contacted multiple times, helping homes stay cleaner and more hygienic, longer. We\u2019ve been working lockstep with governments around the world to make sure we can continue to operate, enabling us to help people and their families meet their health hygiene and cleaning needs. Our operations have been resilient. As of today, our 108 manufacturing plants along with our network of external suppliers are broadly operational with only a few at modified capacity as a result of regulation, workforce, travel restrictions, curfews, material availability or quarantine needs. March was a true test for our product supply planning and logistics organization, which they passed with flying colors. We set records for volume of product produced and shipped. Our largest five North American plants produced and shipped 22% more cases in March than the average of the prior 12 months. The P&G supply organization delivered similar records across Europe, Latin America and other parts of the world, incredibly impressive. Moving to the next priority. P&G has a long history of supporting communities in times of need with the products we produce and other forms of support. P&G donations of product and cash are significant and will continue to increase as we work with communities around the world to support their efforts to help people through this crisis. Millions of P&G products are being donated, helping to ensure that families have basic access to the everyday essentials many of us take for granted. We\u2019re partnering to provide additional support with some of the world\u2019s leading relief organizations, including the International Federation of Red Cross Americares and Direct Relief and key regional organizations such as Feeding America, Matthew 25 : Ministries, the Child and Youth Development Foundation, One Foundation, the Korea Disaster Relief Association, the United Way and many others. We\u2019re working to protect health care workers and first responders. United States Center for Disease Control has issued the guidance recommending proper shaving when wearing N95 and similar respiratory masks in order to ensure proper mask fit for maximum protection. Gillette has donated razors around the world to hospitals and other facilities to protect the people working to care for others. We\u2019ve modified equipment to produce hand sanitizer in nearly a dozen manufacturing sites around the world, using it to ensure our people can continue to operate safely and sharing it with hospitals, health care facilities, and relief organizations. Colleagues in our Gattatico plant in Italy volunteered to create an extra shift to produce surface cleaning and sanitizing products that are being donated to 70 hospitals across that country. Work is underway to produce critically needed nonmedical facemasks. We\u2019re already up and running in China and the U.S. and we currently have teams working to solve additional capacity in every region of the world and will quickly begin production in those areas in coming weeks. When fully operational, we expect to be producing more than 10 million masks per month. We\u2019ve leveraged P&G R&D, engineering and manufacturing capability to quickly produce face shields in Boston and Cincinnati, which are currently being used in hospitals and COVID-19 testing centers. We\u2019re using our marketing and communications expertise to encourage consumers to support public health measures to help flatten the curve and slow the spread of the virus. P&G is committed to the priorities of ensuring the health and safety of our employees, maximizing availability of products and helping society overcome the challenges of the crisis. Our strategic choices remain the right ones and serve each of these priorities : A portfolio of daily use products, many providing health hygiene and cleaning benefits and categories where performance plays a significant role in brand choice; superior science-based products delivered with superior packaging and retail execution; consumer communication and value in all price tiers where we compete. As you know, we\u2019ve made investments to strengthen the long-term health and competitiveness of our brands, and we\u2019ll continue to invest to extend our margin of advantage and quality of execution, improving options for consumers around the world. The strategic need for this investment, the short term need to manage through this crisis and the ongoing need to drive balance top and bottom line growth including margin expansion, each underscore the continued importance of productivity. We\u2019re driving cost savings and efficiency improvements in all facets of our business in our second five-year $10 billion productivity program, cost productivity and cash up and down the income statement and across the balance sheet. Success in our highly competitive industry requires agility that comes with a mindset of constructive disruption, a willingness to change, adapt and create new trends and technologies that will shape our industry for the future. In this environment, that agility and constructive disruption mindset are even more important. How can we be even safer while both produce even helping more, what new needs must we meet and what new ways, an ongoing mindset of constructive disruption and disruptive possibility. Our new organization structure, six industry-based sector business units that manage our 10 product categories with a differentiated approach in focus markets and enterprise markets, and very small corporate groups with best-in-class function expertise is serving us well. A more empowered, agile and accountable organization with little overlap or redundancy following to new demands, seamlessly supporting each other to deliver our priorities around the world. These strategic choices we\u2019ve made to focus and strengthen our portfolio and daily use categories where performance drives brand choice to establish and extend the superiority of our brands to make productivity is integral to our culture as innovation, to leave constructive disruption across the value chain and to improve organization focus, agility and accountability are not independent strategies. They reinforce and build on each other. As we said at CAGNY, the best response to the uncertainties and sources of volatility we face is to double down on this integrated set of strategies, which are delivering very strong results. These integrated and mutually reinforcing strategies are a foundation for strong balanced growth and value-creation. The best response to what we are challenged with today is to push forward, not to pull back, and that\u2019s exactly what we intend to do. I want to now describe how this approach has played out in the quarter we just completed and how we think it could play out across both, the longer term and the arguably more challenging short to mid-term. First, as I\u2019ve said, strong results in the January to March quarter. When we spoke with you at the CAGNY conference on February 20th, we said that results for the January to March quarter in China and for the total Company will be materially impacted on both the top and bottom-line by the dynamics affecting the market in China. Remember at that point in time, COVID-19 was really just a China and travel retail issue. Korea had reported only 50 cases. The U.S., Japan, Italy and Iran combined had reported only 30 cases, 15 and 10, 3 and 2, respectively. At CAGNY, we were internally expecting organic sales in Greater China, our second largest and second most profitable market to be down as much as 20%. Through the incredible efforts of our organization, we did much better than we were expecting in Greater China, down only 8%, excluding travel retail. We saw a strong lift in our categories in e-commerce that make up a portion of sales lost in closed physical stores. We quickly restored production capability, built share as a result and are now operating at very close to full strength. As the pandemic unfortunately developed in the U.S. and Europe as the quarter progressed, demand surged. We finished the quarter with organic sales growth of 10% in the U.S., 14% in Canada, 6% in European focus markets, 15% in European enterprise markets and 11% in Latin America. At CAGNY, we were internally projecting Q3 organic sales growth for the Company of around 2%, we delivered 6% with 9 of 10 categories growing organic sales. We built aggregate share, despite temporary out-of-stocks in some of our highest demand items. While we don\u2019t have final U.S. all-outlet share through March, share results and track channels through March show broad-based growth. Vicks respiratory products were up more than 4 points, Metamucil and Pepto-Bismol up 3 points. Olay moisturizers and Oral-B power toothbrushes up more than 2 points; Always Pads Always Discreet, Tampax, Tide, Dawn, Cascade and Gillette blades and razors each up 1 point or more; Pantene, Head & Shoulders, Old Spice, Native, Secret, Crest, Mr. Clean, Gain and Bounce, each growing share. As you can see in the track channel data, our share declined recently in baby and Family Care categories, due largely to out-of-stocks on our high demand brands. We\u2019re pushing production to its limits but we expect share softness to continue while consumer pantry stocking remains at extreme levels. In China, we built share in offline stores and in e-commerce. Safeguard and Gillette delivered strong share performance in both channels. Head & Shoulders is particularly strong offline in a way Whisper and Pampers posted solid online share growth. Top line results this quarter obviously benefited from consumer pantry loading in preparation for in-home quarantining. We\u2019re planning for pantry inventory levels to eventually return to normal. This higher level of consumer demand was served with our ramp-up and production levels and the depletion of retailer inventories. As at-home inventory decreases, we expect to refill the retail inventory pipeline. We believe the net effect of all of this shifted about 2 points of sales growth on a global basis from Q4 into Q3. Back to CAGNY, we were expecting a slight decline in core earnings per share for the quarter. We delivered instead a $1.17 per share, an increase of 10%. The significant volume of sales increase, related fixed cost leverage and our ongoing productivity efforts more than offset a growing FX challenge and higher virus-related operational costs. Commodities also provided a benefit. Core gross margin up 120 basis points, excluding currency up 130. Core operating margin up 100 basis points, currency-neutral core operating margin up 180 basis points. Core earnings per share up 10%, currency-neutral core earnings per share up 15%. $4.1 billion in operating cash flow, adjusted free cash flow productivity at 113%, returning $2.8 billion in cash to share owners, $1.9 billion in dividends and $900 million in share repurchase. So, January-March, 6% organic sales growth, 10% core earnings per share growth, 113% free cash flow productivity building share. Fiscal year-to-date, 6% organic sales growth, 16% core earnings per share growth, over 100% adjusted free cash flow productivity building share. Just two days ago, we announced a 6% increase in our dividend, reflecting both, these results and the confidence we have in our future. This was the 64th consecutive annual increase and the 130th consecutive year in which P&G has paid a dividend. So, that\u2019s January through March and fiscal year-to-date, very strong results in very difficult conditions. Shifting to longer term, we remain well-positioned to serve consumers and create value in a very attractive industry. And as I said previously, our strategy to do this is unwavering. Consumption of our products is not likely to dissipate. In fact, the relevance of our categories and consumers\u2019 lives potentially increases. We will serve what will likely become a forever altered health hygiene and cleaning focus for consumers who use our products daily or multiple times each day. There may be an increased focus on home, more time at home, more meals at home, more cleaning of homes with related consumption impacts. The importance of noticeably superior performance potentially grows. There\u2019s potential for increased preference for established, reputable, dependable brands that solve newly framed problems better than other alternatives, potentially less experimentation. Potential for a lasting shift for e-commerce, both etailers and omni-channel. Our experience to date makes us believe we are generally well-positioned in this environment. Increased demand has focused retailers on the core SKUs that drive the business. There\u2019s potential for this to result in a cutting of the long tail of inefficient SKUs and brands in our categories. We\u2019re discovering daily lower cost ways of working with fewer resources. Today\u2019s necessity birthing the productivity inventions of tomorrow. New digital tools are being brought to the forefront, providing another productivity rocket booster on the factory floor and in the office environment. So, in the longer term, we believe we are relatively well-positioned to serve consumers\u2019 heightened needs and their changing behavior to serve the needs of our retail and distributor partners across channels and geographies and to create value. In the short to midterm, outcomes are frankly anyone\u2019s guess. Epidemiologists will have wide variations in their best and worst case scenarios for viral spread, mortality, the shape and duration of the curve. We may see months of sporadic production suspension due to local quarantines or raw material supply. It\u2019s not just our operations that matter here. It\u2019s those of our suppliers, of contractors and of our transportation partners. A lot must go right in a very challenging environment and not all of it will. Customers may close stores. There will continue to be extreme foreign exchange and commodity costs volatility. Added operational complexity will result in higher costs. Unemployment will impact outcomes, perhaps severely. All of this occurs on top of what was already unprecedented uncertainty and volatility in our categories and markets. But, as you saw in the development of the business in just five weeks from CAGNY to March 31st and as we\u2019ve just talked about in our long-term outlook where there\u2019s volatility, there are opportunities to serve as well as challenges. There\u2019s a very wide range of possible near-term scenarios and it\u2019s futile to spend too much time trying to assign probabilities to each. We\u2019d be fooling ourselves and fooling you to try. As we stand here today though, we continue to believe our guidance ranges for the fiscal year on both the top and bottom lines remain relevant. Our internal forecasts remain within these ranges. But, I must again emphasize ranges and I must again emphasize the degree of uncertainty and volatility we face day to day. We currently expect organic sales growth for the year in the range of 4% to 5%, assuming continued operations in our facilities and those of our customers and suppliers. On the bottom line, we\u2019re forecasting core earnings per share growth in the range of 8% to 11% for the year. This tool assumes no significant interruption in the extended supply chain through to our retail and distributor partners. This earnings per share range now includes over $400 million of after tax foreign exchange headwinds. Just since CAGNY, FX has moved against us by approximately $0.10 per share, over 2 percentage points for core earnings per share growth on the year. And the fourth quarter FX is currently forecast to be a 7-point hit to core earnings per share growth. Please recall that our fourth quarter bottom line comps include the earnings gains from the Boston land sale and the divestiture of two Oral Care brands in the base period. These items combined are an additional 7-point headwind to core earnings per share growth, Q4. While we do expect some midterm benefit in commodity costs from the recent decline in oil prices, it usually takes about six months for movements in feedstocks like oil to make their way through the raw material supply chain and our inventories to our P&L. That we don\u2019t expect to offset to FX headwinds from lower commodity costs within this fiscal year. As a result of all of this, you might likely guess that we\u2019re closer as we talk today to the bottom end of the earnings per share guidance range than the top end. But, we also go back quickly to our priorities and note that none of the three include hitting quarterly consensus estimates. We will be focused on serving colleagues, consumers, customers, communities, building our business for the many more months that will follow this crisis than the months that will exist within it. But we\u2019ll do this responsibly and keep our choices squarely centered on mid and long-term value-creation. We continue to expect adjusted free cash flow productivity of 100%. We\u2019ll extend our long track record of significant cash generation and cash return expecting to pay over $7.5 billion in dividends, share repurchase in the range of $7 billion to $8 billion in fiscal 2020. We\u2019ll provide our first outlook for fiscal 2021 on our year-end call as we typically do in July. Before turning to your questions, I want to address just two items I expect are on your minds. The first is liquidity. Our liquidity status remains very strong. We are a 183-year old company this year and we take a long-term view to balance sheet management. We aim to maintain our AA minus credit rating and to manage within the ratios that support that rating. With a $5 billion term issue three weeks ago at approximately 3%, we now have $15 billion in cash on hand and are generating more each day. We continue to have open access to the U.S. commercial paper markets, recently issuing over $3 billion on three months paper as a part of our routine financing efforts. The amount of debt maturing in the next 18 months is well within anticipated cash availability. And while we don\u2019t expect to need to draw on them, we have $8 billion in bank credit lines available if needed. That\u2019s credit, very strong. The second topic is recession. We\u2019re assuming it\u2019s already here and will be here for some period of time. While we are not immune, our current strategy puts us on better footing than prior downturns to weather economic headwinds. Our portfolio is now focused on daily use items where performance drives brand choice. We have much less exposure to discretionary items than we had during the last downturn. We\u2019ve increased the superiority of our offerings, simultaneously increasing their value. While not perfect, we had stronger entries across price peers, better pricing ladders. We\u2019re emphasizing performance-based value messaging. We will serve with relevant pack sizes designed to hit key cash outlay thresholds for consumers who need to make week-to-week purchase decisions based on cash availability. Our productivity muscle is now well developed. None of these make us recession-proof, but they should each help. Summing up, the men and women at P&G working together to deliver three very strong quarters, averaging 6% organic sales growth, 16% core earnings per share growth and over a 100% adjusted free cash flow productivity, we\u2019ve built market share. Our Board has increased the dividend 6%, reflecting both strong results and confidence in the future. We really do believe there is a very bright future ahead. We\u2019ll manage the short to mid-term, consistent with the strategy we\u2019ve outlined many times and against the immediate priorities of ensuring employee health and safety, maximizing availability of our products to serve health, hygiene and cleaning needs and helping society overcome the challenges of this crisis. We\u2019re stepping forward, not back. We\u2019re doubling down to serve consumers and our communities. We\u2019re doing this in our interest and society\u2019s interest and in the interest of our long-term shareholders. While we may not see you in person soon, we look forward to engaging with you on the phone and would love to hear your voice. We are here with you and are here for you. Feel free to call our offices as you normally would, our phones. You know where to find us. And with that, I\u2019ll be happy to take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Steve Powers : Good morning, Jon. Thanks for the comprehensive update. Clearly, a ton of questions. I guess, maybe we could start with just a little more detail on what you\u2019re expecting in terms of the shape of demand, both consumption and shipment wise as we head into the fourth quarter, especially in the U.S. where it appears shipments lag. Consumption in the March period, it sounds like you\u2019re expecting a reversal of that in the coming quarters. Just some more color there, as well as China, where as you say things seem better, on trend versus where you thought they\u2019d be in February. And then, I\u2019m also curious, just building on your final comments there around preparedness for coming recession. I guess, if you think about where you are in your fiscal \u201821 planning process, could you just give us a little insight as to how -- clearly this has been an abrupt change, but in terms P&G\u2019s planning preparedness, how recessionary planning has factored into your thinking more on a run rate basis? Like, are you -- I guess, the question from investors is, are you scrambling to put in place the recession playbook or is this something that P&G has been factoring in and considering for some time? Thanks. Jon Moeller : Thanks, Steve. As it relates to the fourth quarter, there are, as you readily appreciate, a ton of moving parts. Geographies are in very different places in the cycle, categories have different levels of need and demand. There\u2019s the supply situation and then there is the retail inventory dynamics as well as consumer pantry dynamics. And again, you multiply that by a 100 countries around the world and 10 categories and many more brands and you realize that you probably don\u2019t have the answer. As we were sitting together at CAGNY five weeks ago, I don\u2019t think any of us in our conversations would have assumed how the next five weeks would unfold. And I don\u2019t pretend to know how the next 8 to 10 weeks is going to unfold. Having said that, you mentioned China. Our business there is rebounding nicely, both from an operations standpoint and from a consumption standpoint. We are seeing a continued significant demand in our categories and the supply and retail inventories are being steadily rebuilt. In the U.S., -- and I focus on these two markets because as you know, they are our largest markets, so to give you some relative feel. April has started off very strong double digit rates from an order standpoint. We expect that to tail off as the lines are set between retail inventory, restocking and consumer demand. But having said that, we are definitely seeing increased consumption levels, not just increased buying levels to put in pantries. I mentioned that in the U.S. we\u2019re seeing an increase in the number of loads of laundry that are done per week, the number of garments that are cleaned after one wearing. With much more in-home meal preparation, there\u2019s a lot more cleaning that needs to be done. And we\u2019re seeing consumption, for example at-home consumption of cleaning aids,, whether that\u2019s surface cleaners or paper towels or Swiffer continuing to be very, very strong. Our Home Care business, if I have my numbers right, was double digits in sales and that\u2019s following or in line with what we\u2019re seeing in terms of consumption. Now, having said all that, and sorry for the long answer but there\u2019s no short one. We have never faced the level of unemployment that we\u2019re likely to see in this country and potentially in others. And we don\u2019t know how long that will occur for. We\u2019ve never faced a complete shutdown of very important channels of commerce, whether that\u2019s travel retail, whether that\u2019s the electric channel in Europe, whether that\u2019s the specialty beauty channel. So, there\u2019s a huge amount of volatility we\u2019re likely to experience and we\u2019ll learn more every day. Our fourth quarter sales guidance, deductively, given fiscal year-to-date results and our fiscal year guidance is minus 2 to plus 2. As I indicated in my prepared remarks, the pull-forward from Q4 to Q3 was about 2 points. So, that minus 2 to plus 2 on an apples-to-apples basis is really zero to 4. And while that may not seem like a lot, given a 6 year-to-date, recall again a number of things. One, it\u2019s our highest comp period. So, last year, organic sales by quarter were 4, 4, 5 and 7. 2 will have a full quarter of the impact of these channel closures and store closures. 3 will have the inventory dynamics, however, those net out that I described. So, when you put all that together, zero to 4, accurate, I doubt it, but it\u2019s representative of the combination of all those dynamics. So, it\u2019s the best number we have. And again, I apologize for the length of this answer, but it\u2019s not a topic that lends itself to simple formula. On recession and recessionary playbook, I really do believe that we have made major steps as a company since the last recession that significantly improve our hand, whether that\u2019s productivity, whether that\u2019s a focus on superiority, which is critical, because certainly price points matter and we\u2019re prepared to address that. But overall, value proposition really matters. And at a time when there\u2019s heightened concern about the need for a product to work and be efficacious, as I take care of my family and my home, the superiority plays an even bigger role. So, the changes we\u2019ve made there I think will put us in much better stead. I talked about the portfolio and the difference and the preponderance of our product serving needs on a daily basis versus much more discretionary portfolio and not daily use based in some categories that we\u2019ve divested. So, this is a playbook that we\u2019ve been developing for both good times and bad times, month-by-month, year-by-year. And I really do believe we\u2019re in a better position. Having said that, when something significant like this happens, would it be right to sit back and assume that we\u2019ve got it covered? No. So, we are making very deliberate plans business by business, market by market to ensure we\u2019re as well positioned as we can be. And there will be changes and there will be adjustments, and they won\u2019t always be right, and we\u2019ll have to remain agile and learn and adjusted as we go. Operator : Next question will come from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks. Hi, Jon. I was hoping you could talk a little bit. You mentioned that you are focusing your production on kind of key SKUs, starting to talk about thinking through changes in pack size and affordability. But, I was also wondering about promotional spending. We\u2019ve heard certainly from some of the food companies already just about promotion, more or less and stores being shut down U.S., and that\u2019s happening in Europe I\u2019m assuming by government mandate. So, how should we think about pricing going forward, even just from the standpoint of complete change in the promotional landscape, just normal everyday kind of stuff. So, that was one area of question. And the other thing I was curious about is we haven\u2019t talked much about emerging markets outside of China. And just thinking about as the virus presumably spreads and start to have a bigger impact in some of your enterprise skewing markets, how you are maybe planning for that or what\u2019s kind of built into the thought process beyond the next, probably a month or two on this getting worse in emerging markets? Jon Moeller : Thanks, Lauren. The promotional dynamics in our categories are changing pretty significantly, just as they are in food and beverage, which you referenced. It\u2019s really nobody\u2019s interest to be promoting products when you don\u2019t have them, when there is not a sufficient inventory to supply demand. So, if we look at for the full quarter, the amount of volume in our categories as a percentage of sales that moved on promotion, that\u2019s down about 5 points, and obviously that number would be much more significant in the month of March. And I don\u2019t really know how that will develop going forward, but certainly, if I had to guess, there will be less promotion in the next couple of quarters where the job is restocking and replenishing than had been the case historically. Price in the quarter was a net benefit of plus 1. And if I look back over the last 30 quarters, price has typically been a benefit of 1 to 2, sometimes, very rarely, but sometimes zero or minus 1, sometimes a little bit more, in that range. But it\u2019s pretty much in that range. And as I mentioned, our strategy is unchanging. So, an innovation based strategy, I don\u2019t see any reason why there will be a dramatic change in the contribution of price, particularly also because you have significant currency devaluations in many parts of the world, where some amount of pricing will be needed over time, done appropriately and sensitively to recover cost structures in those markets. Right now, in emerging markets outside of China, we\u2019re operating and thinking rightly or wrongly, day-by-day, because situation changes dramatically. India is a good example. That market is effectively shut and will be at least through the end of April. We\u2019re working with governments, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, to establish the essential nature of our product categories for their citizens and therefore gain the ability to operate, which we largely have. That\u2019s been a significant focus area over the last five weeks, and it\u2019s a daily endeavor. And then, once we establish our ability to operate, we then have to source materials and we have to ensure that employees can get to work, which sounds simple, but is anything but. For example, we\u2019ll go back to India again, there is a prohibition on any transport of people across state lines. And you can imagine, it wouldn\u2019t be unusual that we might have a plant or two that are located close to a state border, and you might imagine that some of the people that work in that facility live on the other side of that line. So, that\u2019s just an example of kind of the level of operational agility that we\u2019re having to execute. In order to continue operating in the Philippines, we had to basically secure access to a dorm next to our production facility in which to house and protect employees as a condition of operating. So, we\u2019re not that far out in our thinking about how to operate in these markets. Right now, it\u2019s day-to-day. Operator : Next question will come from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : So, I just want to spend some time on your market share expectations going forward. The comments were helpful in terms of thinking about a recession. Obviously, you guys have had a lot of market share momentum over the last couple of years, particularly in the U.S. Can you just discuss the forward puts and takes, as you think about a post-COVID environment, all your market share. And specifically, what I was most interested in was consumer trade-down risk in your mind and then also in emerging markets as you think about covering FX pressure there with pricing, relative to local competition. Can you talk about how market share dynamics would play into your thought process there? Thanks. Jon Moeller : Some real positive developments from a market share standpoint as I walked you through over the last quarter, and no reason for those underlying trends, not to continue, particularly when they\u2019re based on again, performance advantages at a time when performance is required more than ever. Will there be a trade down pressure? I don\u2019t know, but I think it would be silly to assume none. And will there be some share pressure as a result of pricing moves that need to be made? Undoubtedly that we\u2019re going to be very careful in terms of pricing that we do take in emerging markets and will likely tie that much more closely to local inflation than we would to the financial markets and currency and as a result should encounter fewer issues relative to competition than we would if we were just pricing to the currency conversion number. The biggest pressure on shares in the near term is none of any of that. It\u2019s the ability to supply very, very high levels of demand in some categories. I mentioned two categories in our prepared remarks, Family Care, which is our Bounty and Charmin business, and Baby Care. And let me just describe briefly some of the dynamics that occur in the Family Care category as an example. We can see a scenario where our business continues to grow at strong double digit rates and we lose share. That\u2019s because the market is growing at an even higher rate than that. Many of our competitors in that business source the industrial or commercial market, as well as the consumer market. Our business is entirely focused on the consumer market. Those companies have the ability with what is largely a shuttered hospitality industry as an example, to move production from an industrial or commercial focus to a consumer focus. You don\u2019t have that excess capacity to make that move. So, our throughput is up significantly on a per line basis. The results are going to be very, very good. But, we will probably, in that context, lose some share. So, what I wouldn\u2019t expect going forward, and I\u2019m -- here I\u2019m talking about the next three to six months is a continued steady increase in share levels. But, I also wouldn\u2019t expect significant diminution of our position. We\u2019re committed to not have that happen. We talk about that actively. But, there will be more volatility in the share numbers just because of all of the market dynamics that we\u2019re trying to manage. Operator : The next question will come from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citi. Q - Wendy Nicholson : Two question. First, pretty straight forward on Microban. It seems like great timing to have launched that, but I\u2019m surprised you haven\u2019t expanded it to more a consumer centered business as opposed to professional. So, any plans there? I also noticed that you don\u2019t sell Microban rights, which seems like a category that\u2019s just going to be bigger and grow there for a long time to come. So, can you just comment on why or why not you might enter that category? And then, can you talk about just e-commerce generally? I assume servicing the e-commerce channel is no different than servicing other brick-and-mortar retailers. But maybe can you talk about -- I don\u2019t know that I heard how much it grew in the quarter or what percentage of business it was in the quarter, especially in the U.S.? Thanks so much. A - Jon Moeller : Sure, Wendy. Let me start with the second part of your question. The e-commerce business grew about -- globally about 35% in the quarter. It\u2019s now about 10% of our business globally. As we\u2019ve talked many times previously, we view ourselves as very well positioned within that channel and continue to strengthen that position. The two largest sources of growth by far are the U.S. and China with some categories growing in e-commerce in those two markets, as much as 50%. And obviously the at-home dynamics and the unwillingness to congregate in physical stores is driving a fair amount of that. We\u2019ll have to see where that nets out, but I don\u2019t think it all goes away. I think, we\u2019ve seen a permanent shift in the percentage of business that\u2019s going to be done in e-commerce and we view that positively. And when I talk about e-commerce, I\u2019m talking broadly including omni-channel, click and pick, and all forms and varieties of e-commerce. Microban is a wonderful, fantastic product. We were serendipitous in terms of our launch timing. We are at full capacity at this point and are focused on the products we currently have in markets and the channels that we\u2019re currently operating in. But obviously, we\u2019ll work to develop that business to its full potential and that could include a number of different avenues of pursuit. Operator : The next question will come from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Olivia Tong : Two questions here. How does it change how you think about new product rollout timing? Do some ideas get backtracked while others get pushed out promotion strategies, how you market and build trial, because obviously market advisors can\u2019t really do their job right now? And then, secondly, in terms of margins, how does the current environment sort of help or hurt the margins? Because the categories that are moving are typically lower margin, but commodities have obviously come down and promotion isn\u2019t quite as necessary in many of these categories in the near term. But on the other hand, FX is worse and we expect it to some trade down. So, just those two areas, if you could elaborate on both, that would be great. Thank you. Jon Moeller : So, we obviously saw a positive margin development in the quarter we just completed. We\u2019ve seen positive margin development fiscal year-to-date. Our guidance would imply positive margin development for the fiscal year. And as we talk about balance growth and value-creation, I\u2019ve explained many times, but it\u2019s not possible to get to where we want to get from a value-creation standpoint without strong top line growth and margin improvement. Yes, there are some headwinds but there are also tailwinds, commodities as you mentioned, should be a tailwind longer term. And we\u2019ve got our -- we continue our efforts on our productivity program. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, there\u2019s additional learning that\u2019s come out of our experience the last five weeks on ways we might be even more productive, both in generating top line sales and in containing cost. So, my expectation there is that there continues to be a level of margin improvement going forward. In terms of product launch and we\u2019re in the middle now of going through each category and determining are there any changes that need to be made, either out of necessity or by design to maximize the impact of those planned initiatives. And in terms of how products are brought to market, I don\u2019t see really significant changes. For example, there\u2019s more media consumption that\u2019s occurring right now than probably there has been in the last three or four years. So, changing that model doesn\u2019t really make a lot of sense. And by media, I\u2019m talking about not just TV but digital consumption as well. So, I don\u2019t see significant changes there. I think, our model with some adjustments will continue to be relevant and effective. And then, we just need to look at timing by initiative there. I wouldn\u2019t expect a net of that exercise either to have a significant impact on our ability to continue to grow. Operator : Next question will come from the line of Steve Strycula with UBS. Steve Strycula : Hi. Good morning and congratulations on being able to raise the dividend in a period of time like this and deliver consistency in results. Jon, I have a question. I appreciate that the Company\u2019s pivoted and evolved this portfolio to more daily use products over the last decade. But, could you help us for the products that you still have in today\u2019s portfolio? How did the organic sales really perform during the financial crisis for those products that are still in the portfolio today? And then, I have a quick follow-up. Jon Moeller : I don\u2019t have a category by category analysis of that. I just haven\u2019t had the time to get to that, although it\u2019s a very good question. But, what we do know and we refreshed learning on over the last five weeks is what\u2019s happened to market sizes in our categories during times of recession. And as you\u2019ll readily understand, our categories are not immune from recessionary impacts, but they\u2019re much less sensitive to that dynamic and most other categories across industry. And so, if we look at recessionary periods, the market has typically contracted in terms of its growth rate. So, it\u2019s continued to grow, but has contracted maybe 1 point. So, then the question becomes, okay, one, can we do anything about that if we can. Two, what\u2019s your relative position within that market and are you well-positioned to at least hold your ground if not build your position? And again, I feel better about that than I have at any time in our recent history. That doesn\u2019t mean that there won\u2019t be categories that from a market standpoint aren\u2019t impacted with more than others. And that doesn\u2019t mean that there won\u2019t be individual situations typically at a brand or category country level. In fact do lose some share. But, I mean, put it this way, as we think about our planning for next year, we\u2019re not giving ourselves any break relative to share. We expect to hold and build share. Steve Strycula : Thanks for that. And then, a quick follow-up. For emerging markets, I\u2019m not asking about the month of April. We\u2019re taking a longer-term view here. But, in a marketplace where maybe some of the points of distribution are temporary shuttered and consumers are being impacted by the macro, can you expect that volumetrically, household, personal care products as an industry should be able to grow during a period like this of volatility. And what can you guys do within Procter\u2019s capability to be able to execute under that type of environment? Thank you. Jon Moeller : Absolutely, we should expect growth in these markets, absent physical barriers, either regulations or operational barriers that prevent products from getting first into stores and into markets and into consumers\u2019 hands. It\u2019s not necessarily a harbinger of the future, but I mentioned Latin America as an example growing 11% in the last quarter. The fundamental drivers of that demand remain as we go forward. In terms of our ability to capture those opportunities, our strategy in emerging markets is fundamentally the same and it\u2019s been working very, very well from both the top line standpoint and a bottom-line standpoint. By the same, I mean, our focus on superior products in daily use categories where performance means brand choice, delivered as productively as we can, and we still have lots of opportunities to improve in that context. With excellent communication, best-in-class go-to-market execution, the playbook is the same and works in enterprise markets. Operator : Next question will come from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Hey. Good morning folks. Thank for sliding me in. Jon, you\u2019ve covered a lot of ground, and I appreciate the thoroughness. I\u2019d love just to dive into a couple of business in a little more depth as possible. First, you mentioned that travel retail has been a bit more challenging. Can you contextualize how large is it for you as a percentage of sales and how it performed last quarter and what you\u2019ve seen more recently? And secondly, in terms of results, Grooming was a bit of a surprise to me. And you in mentioned in the press release some weakness in North America. Maybe I missed it, but I don\u2019t think you covered off on it in prepared remarks. Can you touch on what\u2019s happening in the Grooming business, please? Jon Moeller : Let me start in a slightly different place, but I will get to your end points. The Beauty business generally and which is a primary business that\u2019s sold in travel retail, continues to perform very strongly. We hit our 17th quarter of organic -- consecutive of organic sales growth in Beauty in what is arguably the most difficult quarter we faced in a long, long time, really significant and positive growth across almost all parts of the portfolio. So, we overcame in the quarter a greater than 20% reduction in SK-II sales with solid growth in our other categories. The travel retail business specifically is round number, is a $1 billion business that\u2019s gone. It\u2019s gone because there\u2019s no travel. Having said that that -- the products that were brought in travel retail were consumed in markets and our job needs to be to make up for that travel retail loss in the near term by serving those markets. And we are for example, seeing significant uptake already on SK-II consumption purchase in mainland China, which was one of the big sources of the travel retail demand. So, generally, are performing very, very well in Beauty. And we\u2019ll continue to -- the SK-II impact will have a full quarter now going forward for the next three quarters in all likelihood. So, the challenge will become greater in terms of overcoming that. But, we\u2019re in a pretty good position to be able to at least make progress in that direction. From a Grooming standpoint, we don\u2019t share during the quarter on global basis, which is great, and follows on a number of periods in a row now of share growth for the global Grooming business. The biggest challenge we face on -- we face two challenges in Grooming currently. One is, which I just -- actually I don\u2019t even know I talked about it here, doesn\u2019t matter, is the closing of the electric channel in Europe where a large amount of Braun products were sold. That also affects, by the way our power Oral Care business, which also utilizes our channel. But presumably, as soon as that reopens, which hopefully will be soon, that challenge dissipates. The other challenge is lower shave frequency while working from home, to put it bluntly. But, that\u2019s something where we\u2019re currently working through. As I said, we\u2019ve built share, we want to maintain our share position. We need to work with our retail partners as well who have in some cases, de-prioritized grooming in the very near term to deal with the empty shelves and some of the other aisles of the store. If we can do that effectively, no reason we can\u2019t continue to hold and build share. Operator : The next question will come from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JP Morgan. Andrea Teixeira : Thanks. And I wish you continued health, to all of you on this call. Jon, I appreciate the bridge of underlying zero to 4% globally. And just to think about the puts and takes by region, what are you seeing in terms of the pickup in China? And I think you alluded a little bit on the call, an improvement in Beauty and Baby there. And do you expect, by my math, 80 basis points drag in the third quarter? It seems flat in the fourth, and be above the zero to 4 range that is implied. And also a question on mix, which is the improvement in skincare globally in China coming back help the mix effect, which I think was flat in the quarter just concluded but typically was up 50 to 100 basis points in the past. Thank you. A - Jon Moeller : So, definitely relative to the quarter that we just completed, China offers upside quarter-to-quarter sequentially, and I expect that upside is significant. I would see us growing that business ideally at very healthy levels, at pre-crisis levels ideally in the subsequent quarter, which you\u2019re right, would get -- give a lift to the zero to 4 kind of logic. We are seeing, at least in China, mix come back in pre-crisis levels from a positive standpoint. I mentioned the strength of the SK-II restart as an example. So, that also is a positive. But remember, we have massive challenge ahead of us collectively in the U.S. and Europe, depending on how the economy develops. I mean, we literally sense the Great Depression had not managed with the level of unemployment we might see. So, the question behind your question is, is there upside to the zero to 4, I would encourage you not to go there. Operator : Next question will come from the line of Nik Modi from RBC Capital Markets. Nik Modi : Jon, it\u2019s pretty clear looking at the data that consumers are migrating back to big brands. Now, that could be because of availability or just safety and comfort in there in what they\u2019re getting. But I\u2019m just curious on two fronts. One is, kind of as you\u2019ve been interacting with retailers, how do you think this is all going to shake out in terms of how they think about taking on the brand? I think, you made some comments earlier in the prepared remarks on that. But, any specifics would be helpful. And then, the second thing is, there\u2019s a lot of trials happening right now for a lot of brands that maybe consumers may not have tried and some of your brands. And so, I was just thinking about proactively like what Procter & Gamble could do to kind of create stickiness with some of that trial going forward? A - Jon Moeller : Operator : Next question will come from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : Hey. Good morning Jon. Congratulations on the strong quarter, particularly in the current environment. Jon, I wanted to come back to longer term implications for consumer behavior, given the nature of the current recession, increased working from home and social distancing, and what this is going to mean longer term. You touched on some of this, so positive for cleaning products and Fabric Care, potentially negative for categories like blades and beauty for people working from home. So, I wanted to come back to this. As you see it, what are the longer term implications versus those that are more transitory? How are those conversations going internally? How is the organization balancing near-term objectives given the challenges in the current environment versus potentially modulating the playbook here a bit with what could be longer term structural changes to demand in some of these categories? So, additional thoughts there would be helpful. Thanks Jon. Jon Moeller : We need to stay very close to consumers and their habits, needs and desires more now than ever. Just because we\u2019re at change points in their habits and their consumption levels, and we need to understand those and be responsive to those. We actually meet as a portion of the leadership group three mornings a week at 7 o\u2019clock. And one of the things that we\u2019re very focused on in that meeting is, what is changing relative to consumer need and making sure, I mentioned SKU portfolio is one example, but making sure that we\u2019re positioning ourselves to serve those changing needs as well as we possibly can. I think, the net in terms of demand impact on our total portfolio is clearly a positive longer term. And I don\u2019t -- and when I say that I almost -- I don\u2019t want to minimize for a second any amount of human suffering that\u2019s led to the situation. But, we are seeing increased levels of consumption in the majority of our product categories. Even when we come to something like Beauty, remember, I talked about how this is a 17th consecutive quarter of organic sales growth in a row. And to get to organic sales growth on Beauty with a minus 20%-plus number on SK-II, you have to assume very healthy purchase and consumption levels across the portfolio, which we\u2019re seeing. And I don\u2019t see a reason that that wanes. So, generally, thank you for pointing again to the long-term, which we view as -- we want to -- it\u2019s trite and overused statement, but we really do expect to come out of this stronger than we went into it. We really do believe that there\u2019s a very bright future ahead. And to your point, we need to be very deliberately keeping ourselves aware of what those opportunities are and putting steps in place to be able to seize those opportunities again really under the heading of fully serving consumers. Operator : Next question will come from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark Astrachan : Yes. Thanks and good morning, Jon. I wanted to ask just briefly on private label. So, how should we be thinking about, how you\u2019re thinking about what potentially happens brands versus private label as obviously unemployment increases here. Commentary, what specific things you think we should be watching for categories that are more susceptible than others, I recall paper that\u2019s being one of those that we\u2019ve watched historically. And so, what are you concerned about? What are things we should be focused on and how do you think about that in terms of playing out this time around? Jon Moeller : Generally -- so, let me take you through recent trends and then I realize your question was more future-focused. We\u2019re seeing modest increases in private label share in North America, at the same time that we\u2019re building significant share ourselves. We\u2019re seeing private label share declines pretty consistently in Europe at a time when we\u2019re building share there as well. We can grow our business and our share and Europe is a prime example, we\u2019ve done it for years, during the time when private label is growing. So, that\u2019s the first and very, very important point. Second, in terms of recessionary dynamics, as it relates to private label, I don\u2019t -- we see a number of different behaviors, which affect that overall equation. There are certainly a subset of consumers for whom price becomes a significantly greater portion of their personal value equation. And that will in some cases result in a trade down to private label. Our job becomes having an offering alternatives for them that allows them to achieve the same objective within our branded portfolio. And we have many more rungs in that pricing ladder now than we had during the last recession. There are other consumers who move the other way for whom performance, efficacy, dependability, I can\u2019t afford to be wrong, I can\u2019t buy two, so I need to buy the best, results in a migration to branded offerings. And that\u2019s different by category and by market. But again, going back to something we\u2019ve mentioned a couple of times in this call, I don\u2019t see any reason for us to have an expectation of ourselves that we hold their build share over reasonable periods of time, I mean given month or given quarter, or given category or given country will have issues. But our expectation is that, whether this is a V-shaped recovery, whether it\u2019s L-shaped recovery, whether it\u2019s a prolonged recession, with our portfolio as it\u2019s structured today, continued to focus on superiority, continued focus on excellence and execution, we should be able to hold and build share positions. Operator : The next question will come from Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Bill Chappell : Two quick questions. One, I\u2019m not sure you can answer, but maybe from what you\u2019ve seen in China or what you\u2019ve seen elsewhere, I mean, if you\u2019re looking at a given category that had 10% type increase, would you say like -- is there a way to say like 5% of that is pantry stocking, 2% of that is a stay-at-home orders and then the rest is just normal growth? I mean, is there any way to look at that? And then secondly, on advertising, what\u2019s the plan in this environment? It seems like most large CPG companies have moved away from product advertising and moved more to kind of this is the company message and we\u2019re all in this together, which is great, but just didn\u2019t know if -- that the longer term it\u2019s going to change or cut back or if that\u2019s something just temporary? Jon Moeller : So, in some categories, Bill, we have -- we do have the ability to tease out increases in consumption from pantry loading, et cetera. And for example, there are several categories in the U.S. where we have a panel of either consumers or devices, washing machines, dishwashers that give us information on a routine basis on consumption levels. And where we have that in place, that\u2019s how we\u2019re able to know, for example, when I mentioned earlier, what\u2019s happening to wash frequency of clothes and what constitutes that load, the same in a dishwashing context. So, we\u2019re able to in those categories, see very clearly the increase in use and consumption and obviously then deduct into what might be pantry stocking. There are other categories where we don\u2019t have as good a visibility into that, but we\u2019re working to develop that ability across each of the categories in the major markets, and that\u2019s the clear focus. But, I would say that in general, we\u2019re seeing as much as a 20% increase in consumption across categories of where you\u2019d expect to see that and the balance is pantry to some extent. But remember also, in many of our categories, pantry availability itself leads to greater usage. I start conserving on my usage for example of paper towel or certainly of bathroom tissue as I reach the end of my inventory to defer that trip to the store and certainly avoid a situation where I don\u2019t have any available. If there is lots available, I\u2019m typically not rationing or conserving. So, just having it there results in increased consumption in many of our categories. I\u2019m not the expert in the company on advertising, but I would offer a couple of thoughts. Helping consumers understand how they can meet their own perceived and critical needs for them and their family through the use of our products and many categories is a public service. And as well for many years, well before this, we focused on, if you will, both. Think about the Always Like a Girl campaign as an example. And done well, you can do both simultaneously. But, again, I\u2019m not the advertising expert. If you want more perspective on that, feel free to call my friend Marc Pritchard. Operator : Next question will come from the line of Rob Ottenstein with Evercore. Rob Ottenstein : Great. Thank you very much. And, Jon, thank you to you and your colleagues for all the things that you\u2019re doing to make Procter & Gamble increasingly indispensable. Two questions. First, clearly e-commerce is becoming increasingly important, obviously in the U.S. and in China. Can you talk about the things that you are doing to become increasingly advantaged and meet the needs of your e-commerce partners in the U.S. and China, and maybe what your market share looks like in e-commerce versus brick and mortar in the U.S. and China? And then, the second question, obviously 6% increase in the dividend is impressive. But, I think what would be most interesting for me is to understand the thought process in that increase, given your very clear eye view of the sorts of challenges that the world faces over the next 12-plus months. So, how did Procter & Gamble think about that sort of increase in that context? Thank you. Jon Moeller : Let me start with the second question. We have a very simple philosophy and belief, which is that the cash we generate is not ours, it\u2019s yours. And we have -- that\u2019s of course after meeting the needs of -- and opportunities that are presented by attractive investments. We\u2019re having a good year. And if we deliver against our guidance, it\u2019ll be 8% to 11% core earnings per share growth, operating earnings growth has been pretty much in line with that. And going back to the philosophy and the commitments, that results in a certain outcome. Our business is generally highly cash generative. So, I mentioned we generated $4.1 billion of cash in the quarter. Our payout ratio, with the move we\u2019ve just made is a little bit under 60%. So, there\u2019s plenty of room there, if you will. So, it really stems from our philosophy and our commitment and our result and the cash generative nature of our business. And I don\u2019t expect that to change going forward. Obviously, in extreme situations, we might come to a different conclusion. But so far we\u2019ve been weathering this situation fairly well and expect to do well as we go forward. I might also just comment on the general topic of capital allocation. I started receiving some questions on share repurchase and whether that\u2019s appropriate use of funds in this environment. And I don\u2019t fully understand the question. I do, if you\u2019re accepting government support or something like that. But again, going back to our philosophy, that\u2019s your cash, not our cash that needs to come back to you, either through a dividend or share repurchase. And probably, the worst thing we could do at this period of time when I go back to our priorities, the third one being to help society get through this crisis is take a bunch of cash and sit on it. We\u2019re much better off, I think, returning that cash to society and helping people, during a very difficult time. And as you know, we have a large percentage of retail share owners, individual people, and we have a large ownership position from pension funds, which are representing the needs and wants and dreams or desires of frontline healthcare workers, firemen, policemen, of the bus driver, of teachers. And so, I don\u2019t see any reason not to maintain the stance we\u2019ve taken for many, many years relative to cash return. And I think it\u2019s more vital now than ever. Sorry. I got kind of waylaid on that point, but it\u2019s what I feel strongly about. Relative to e-commerce, it differs pretty widely by category, by country. But, generally, our market shares in e-commerce, our online shares are equal to our offline share or slightly ahead. And also, our margins are generally in line, online and offline. In general, the things that we do to win and best serve consumers offline are relevant online as well. But, there are some specific things we can do to better serve both online shoppers and online retailers, for example, with packaging that\u2019s designed to survive the e-commerce journey, which was physically very demanding, and we\u2019re working to develop proprietary packaging that improves packaging integrity and consumer experience in that specific channel. So, there are channel specific areas of superiority that we can help our customers be relevant and in the process increase our relevance. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Jon Moeller : Thanks everybody. Stay well, stay safe. We\u2019re here. Don\u2019t hesitate to call. Have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to Procter & Gamble's quarter end conference call. Today's event is being recorded for replay. This discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections. As required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business trends and has posted on its Investor Relations website, www.pginvestor.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures.  Now I will turn the call over to P&G's Vice Chairman, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller. Jon Moeller : Good morning. David Taylor, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Chevalier, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, joining me this morning.  We're back in our offices in Cincinnati with our masks, appropriately distanced. We'd like to start by expressing our sincere hope that you and your families are also safe and are well. I'm going to provide an overview of company results, which continue to be strong. David will cast additional light on our immediate priorities and strategic focus areas. We'll close with guidance for fiscal 2021, and of course, take your questions.  Fiscal 2020 was a very strong year. We grew markets and increased household penetration, driving top line growth, bottom line growth as well as market share. It's what we call balanced growth and value creation. Organic sales grew 6%. On a 2-year stack basis, organic sales growth has accelerated from 3% across fiscals '17 and '18 to 6% across fiscal '18 and '19 to 11% over the last 2 years, indicating the underlying strength of our brands and the appropriateness of our strategy, which is driving our business.  We built strong momentum in 1.5 years leading up to the COVID crisis with 6% organic sales growth in calendar year 2019, including 6% in the first half of fiscal 2020. We maintained the strong momentum in the second half of fiscal 2020, overcoming significant challenges, including the lockdown in China, closure of the travel retail, electro, specialty beauty and away-from-home channels, operational challenges, safely staffing our facilities and sourcing materials necessary to maintain and in some categories, significantly increased production to serve heightened consumer cleaning, health and hygiene needs.  David talked at CAGNY 4 years ago about accelerating growth in our 2 largest and most profitable markets. Fiscal year 2020, U.S. organic sales grew 10%, including 5% growth in the first half of the fiscal. China grew 8%, including 13% organic growth in the first half of the year. 9 of 10 product categories grew organic sales. Home Care and Personal Health Care, up in the teens; Family Care, up double digits; Fabric Care and Feminine Care, up high singles. Hair Care, Skin and Personal Care and Oral Care, up mid-singles. Grooming, up 1. Baby, down 1. 30 of our top 50 country category combinations held or grew share.  E-commerce sales were up 40% for the year, up 30% in the first half and 50% in the second half, now over $7 billion in sales, over 10% of the company total. Turning to earnings. Core earnings per share were up 13%. Currency-neutral core earnings per share up 17%. Within this, core gross margin expanded 170 basis points, up 190 basis points constant FX. Core operating margin grew 180 basis points, up 210 basis points, excluding currency impacts.  Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 114%. We increased our dividend 6% and returned $15.2 billion of value to share owners, $7.8 billion in dividends and $7.4 billion in share repurchase. Capping a strong year, a very strong April-June quarter. Organic sales up more than 6% on top of a base period that was up 7%. Volume, pricing and mix, each contributed to top line growth. Strong organic sales growth in our two largest markets, up 19% in the U.S. and 14% in Greater China. Strong market share trends, with aggregate global value share up 50 basis points. At the bottom line, core earnings per share of $1.16, up 5% versus the prior year, up 11% on a currency-neutral basis, including a 7 point headwind from gains on land and small brand sales in the base period. Core gross margin, up 210 basis points, up 250 ex FX. Core operating margin, up 140 basis points, up 190 ex FX. Adjusted free cash flow productivity of 161%.  Coming up, we delivered or overdelivered on each of our going end targets for the year : organic sales growth, core earnings per share growth, free cash flow productivity and cash return to share owners. We built strong momentum heading into the COVID crisis and arguably built this further during the challenging second half of the year. I know I speak for David and the rest of our leadership team when I say that credit for these results goes to our colleagues. The men and women of P&G, who have demonstrated incredible creativity, agility and commitment to serving consumers and customers every day during these unprecedented times.  We will continue to face significant challenges and perhaps a higher degree of uncertainty than any of us have ever faced. But we believe that current consumer dynamics are integrated and mutually reinforcing strategies and our focus on a few immediate priorities position us very well for the future. David? David Taylor : Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. I hope everyone is well. As we outlined last quarter, we've established 3 immediate priorities that guide our actions and our choices in this crisis period. Our first priority is to ensure the health and safety of the men and women we work with, our colleagues around the world. With guidance from medical professionals, we're constantly evaluating and updating the robust measures already in place to help our people who are making, packing and shipping P&G products stay safe at work. This has never been more important as many of our facilities are running around the clock to deliver P&G products during this period of increased demand.  This leads to the second priority : maximizing the availability of products to help people and their families with their cleaning, health and hygiene needs. P&G products play an essential role in helping consumers maintain proper hygiene, personal health and healthy home environments. These products are more important than ever given the needs created by the current crisis. There's an increased awareness of health and hygiene and additional time we're all spending at home.  Third priority is supporting communities, relief agencies and people who are on the front lines of this global pandemic. Millions of P&G products are being donated, helping to ensure families have basic access to everyday essentials many of us take for granted. We're providing significant financial support to numerous relief agencies around the world. We're producing hand sanitizer, face mask and face shields in P&G facilities for our internal use and also for donation to organizations in great need. Finally, we're using our marketing and communications expertise to encourage consumers to support public health measures to help flatten the curve and slow the spread of the virus. And P&G is committed to the priorities of ensuring the health and safety of the employees -- of our employees, maximize the availability of P&G products to serve consumers and help society overcome the challenges in this period.  Our integrated strategic choices remain the right ones. They serve each of our immediate priorities and that the foundation for balanced top and bottom line growth and long-term value creation. We're focused on portfolio of daily-use products in categories where performance plays a significant role in brand choice. Within these categories, we've raised the bar on all aspects of superiority : product, package, consumer communication, retail execution and value. The most sustainable and profitable way to grow is to create new business versus just taking or trading it. Superior offerings, science-based products delivered to a superior packaging drive market growth, which in turn drives share, sales and profit growth. This creates a winning proposition for all concerned, high expansion versus 0 sum. It's the only growth our retailers care about. Growth that is incremental to the category. And if we lead category growth with superior offerings, we will mathematically build market share.  We strive to communicate product and packaging benefits with superior brand messaging. P&G was just named the #1 brand marketer of the decade at the Cannes Lions Festival Creativity in June. Not only has our advertising been creative, it's been increasingly effective at growing markets and building our business. I'm particularly proud of this as it speaks to sustained excellence versus a few great ads.  In addition to winning with consumers' communication, we need superior retail execution, online and in physical stores that contributes to the growth of categories and our brands. Our superior performance in this area has been recognized in third-party surveys of retailers and awards from top customers that we've been mentioned previously. Most recently, Target recognized P&G as supplier of the year across all our product categories in the store. We appreciate the recognitions we've received, but really matters is retailers' improved view of P&G as a partner and joint value creation, helping retailers grow categories and create value on strong distribution, share of shelf, display and feature. The fifth vector of superiority is value for consumers and for customers. In performance-driven categories, consumers often see the value in paying a modest premium for noticeably better product performance. We're strengthening our innovation across price tiers with the aim of delivering superior value at each price tier where we compete. We've made investments to strengthen the long-term health and competitiveness of our brands, and we'll continue to invest to extend our margin of advantage and quality of execution, improving options for consumers around the world.  The strategic need for this investment, the short-term need to manage through this crisis and ongoing need to drive balanced top and bottom line growth, including margin expansion, underscores the importance of productivity. We're driving cost savings and efficiency improvement in all facets of our business, delivering strong cost and cash productivity. Success in our highly competitive industry requires agility that comes with a mindset of constructive disruption, a willingness to change, adapt and create new trends and technologies that will shape our industry for the future.  In this environment, agility and constructive disruption mindset are even more important. How can we be even safer while both producing and helping more? What new needs must be met and in what new ways? We're fostering an ongoing mindset of constructive disruption and disruptive possibility.  Our new organization structure, 6 industry-based sector business units that manage our 10 product categories with a differentiated approach in focused markets and enterprise markets and very small corporate groups with best-in-class functional expertise is also serving us well. A more empowered, agile and accountable organization with little overlap or redundancy flow into new demands, seamlessly supporting each other to deliver against our priorities around the world.  These strategic choices we've made to focus and strengthen our portfolio in daily-use categories where performance drives brand choice, to establish and extend the superiority of our brands, to make productivity as integral to our culture as innovation, to lead constructive disruption across the value chain and to improve organizational focus, agility and accountability are not independent strategies. They reinforce and build on each other. When executed well, they grow markets, which, in turn, grow share, sales and profit. Some examples. Global Home Care improved its noticeable superiority from less than 60% in fiscal '18 to nearly 80% superiority this fiscal year. We invested in product performance, in packaging in each of the subcategories : hand dish, auto dish, dish care and surface care, including launching our new Microban 24 surface standardization product in February.  We step-changed consumer communication, leveraging educational TV advertising, which delivered an immediate lift to the category and our brands by showing consumers more ways to use our products. We elevated in-store execution with additional navigational and educational signage to help the consumer choose the product that is right for them. These superiority investments have yielded strong results. And most importantly, they've grown markets, both before and after the pandemic. P&G Home Care has driven over 60% of the global category market growth and accelerated organic sales growth from low single digits to double digits, increased profit, improved market share 1.5 points and increased household penetration, all in the last 2 years. The business grew organic sales 7% in fiscal '19, 7% in the first half of fiscal '20 ahead of the crisis. We had great momentum that only accelerated in the second half of the year with nearly 25% organic growth. China fem care has been driving category growth through superior innovation and demand creation. Innovation is focused on organics, overnight protection and teens. The Whisper brand has driven 25% of category growth, well above its 12% market share. The brand has grown market share over 2 points over the last 3 years and grown organic sales at an average rate in the high teens over this period. One more, P&G U.S. Personal Home Care -- Health Care, rather, has focused on improving the superiority across all 5 vectors, reaching over 80% superiority across the portfolio this year. P&G brands drove more than 25% of category growth this past year, roughly double their market share weight. Vicks, Metamucil, Pepto-Bismol, Prilosec, Align and ZzzQuil each grew share over the past 3, 6 and 12-month periods, with total U.S. P&G Personal Health Care value share of 1 point or more over these time periods. U.S. Personal Health Care delivered its fourth consecutive year of organic sales growth with high single-digit growth in fiscal '19 and double-digit growth in fiscal '20. We think our strategies, the success we've had behind them and an increased societal focus on health, hygiene and a clean home all bode well for the future. The relevance of our categories and consumers' lives has increased. There may be a long-term increased focus on home, more time at home, more meals at home with related consumption impacts. The importance of noticeably superior performance potentially grows. Organizational agility, high employee engagement, to meet the changing needs of consumers and retailers likely becomes more important. We believe P&G is well positioned to serve consumers' heightened needs and their changing behaviors and to serve the changing needs of our retail and distributor partners, all of which are critical to long-term value creation. I'll turn it back over to John to cover the outlook for fiscal 2021. Jon Moeller : To underscore David's comments, we like our long-term prospects, rooted in service of consumers with increasing needs. The near term, though, will be challenging and is more difficult to predict. Our outlook starts with an assumption of how underlying consumer markets will develop. This by itself is highly uncertain. The reality is that COVID cases are increasing in many parts of the world, without the resources or infrastructure to effectively manage it. We'll likely be operating without a vaccine or advanced therapeutics through fiscal '21. This could prompt tighter containment policies and dramatically reduced mobility, which would affect employment and overall incomes, potentially leading to a deeper and longer recession across large parts of the world.  In the U.S., it's unclear how long we'll be operating at double-digit unemployment levels and how long there will be mitigating economic stimulus available. There continues to be social unrest and economic distress in many parts of the world that affect the prospects for category growth. These same dynamics result in an increased cost to operate. There's also a risk of supply chain disruption of our operations or those of our suppliers being shut down due to local mandates.  Against this challenging backdrop, we're holding ourselves to an expectation of meaningful growth, top line and bottom line and expect to be highly cash generative. We're targeting organic sales growth in the range of 2% to 4%. We expect to grow market share in aggregate for the year and markets where growth could range from flat to around 3% value growth.  We're targeting core earnings per share growth of 3% to 7% versus prior year core earnings per share of $5.12. The bottom line outlook reflects the full range of potential top line outcomes. It also incorporates $300 million after-tax of foreign exchange headwinds, largely offset by $275 million after-tax and commodity cost tailwinds. This outlook also includes a $150 million after-tax headwind from the combination of higher interest expense and lower interest income. If you consider the quarterly cadence of the year, base period comps will play a significant role in top line trends. Organic sales growth should be stronger in the first half of the year and moderate in the second half as we annualize the recent acceleration in category growth. Bottom line growth should be somewhat stronger in the second half due mainly to higher cost productivity as the year progresses.  Fiscal 2021 will continue our long track record of significant cash generation and cash return to share owners. We're targeting another year of 90% adjusted free cash flow productivity. We expect to pay approximately $8 billion in dividends and repurchase $6 billion to $8 billion of shares. This outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Significant currency weakness, commodity cost increases, additional geopolitical disruptions, major production stoppages or additional store closures are not anticipated within this guidance range.  Now I'll hand it back quickly to David for closing comments. David Taylor : We delivered a very strong fiscal 2020, meeting or beating each of the key goals we set out at the start of the year in a challenging and volatile market. We believe we have a bright future ahead. We have the right strategies, portfolio and daily-use categories where performance drives brand choice, superiority and products, packages, consumer communication, retail execution and value, productivity in all areas of cost and cash, constructive disruption in all facets of the operation and improved organizational focus, agility and accountability. We feel we have the right priorities to deal with the immediate challenges the company is facing, ensuring the health -- employee health and safety, maximizing product availability and helping society overcome the challenges of the crisis. We're stepping forward, not back. We're doubling down to serve consumers and communities. We're investing in the superiority of our brands and the capabilities of our organization.  We're doing this in our interest, in society's interest, in the interest of our long-term share owners with an eye fixed on long-term balanced growth and value creation.  With that, we would be happy to answer your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citi. Wendy Nicholson : My question has to do with the enterprise market, both from a short-term perspective and, I guess, a longer-term, more strategic perspective. In the short term, are you seeing any of the challenges that the pandemic have sort of placed in those markets in particular, showing any signs of improvement? Are the challenges alleviating? And then longer term, kind of given where things stand, are you thinking any differently about any of those markets? Are you deciding to -- sure, the tailwind is maybe more negative than I mean, but change your investment philosophy with regard to any of those markets. David Taylor : Wendy, I'll make one comment, then I want to turn it to Jon because he has direct responsibility for the enterprise markets. The comment I'd make is the organizational structure change we made has really helped us deal with this recent pandemic. We grew in enterprise markets where they're facing just a range, as you know, of very big challenges. But if anything, it's reinforced the strength of the organization of choice and actually the possibilities we see for the future. I want to turn it to Jon to talk how we're dealing with it directly. But no, we haven't changed our long-term view on the attractiveness of the enterprise markets. Jon Moeller : And I'm going to take one step to the side, and then I'll come hopefully back to the middle here. Remember that the whole -- from an organization structure context, one of the driving forces and the design was to free up category leaders and sector CEOs to focus on the biggest opportunities, which were the focus markets where we generate 80% of our sales and 90% of our profit. And I, of course, don't want to assert direct causality, but there's nothing to indicate that isn't exactly what's happening. So in the U.S., we grew, as we've said earlier, 10% over the year, 19% in the last quarter. In China, we grew 8% over the year, 14% in the last quarter. Those are our 2 largest focus markets. So that part of the organization strategy is working well. We also wanted to move decision-making in enterprise markets closer to consumers, competitors, customers, with the hope that we would continue to provide strong growth in those markets, both on a top and bottom line standpoint, and that continues to be the case. We grew despite all the difficulty of the last year, 3% organically on the top line. We grew 16% on the bottom line. We exited the year with only 2 of the enterprise markets. That's over 100 countries, losing money, which is unprecedented for us. And we did that, we built that profitability despite significant headwinds and while growing market share. In aggregate, the enterprise markets were up 0.2 points. But we're happy with all of that. Now to get back to the middle and answer to your questions more directly. Yes, we're facing challenges in the enterprise market as a result of the current both health and economic crisis. And yes, it is affecting market sizes negatively. And no, that's not over and arguably continues to worsen.  In terms of our long-term view on these markets, they're an incredibly important piece of the company. We generated in enterprise markets, I think we crossed $14 billion in sales this year, $1.6 billion in aftertax profit. So they're meaningful and can create value. We want to be more consistent in our efforts to do that. So we have made changes to our business models, to our cost structures, to ensure that as we grow in these markets, we can do that profitably. But we remain committed to success in these markets and highly confident we can deliver that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : Congratulations on a great year. A question for David. Just on organizational priorities and how these may have shifted as a result of the pandemic. So no shortage of discussion, of course, in the marketplace around this accelerated channel shift online, more time spent working from home, which seems like it will be lasting certainly to some degree. Much bigger focus on health and wellness, broader emphasis on ESG, just to name a few. So David, could you discuss some of these bigger trends that you see as more lasting versus those that are more transitory? And perhaps how your priority and the organization's priorities may have shifted over the past 6 to 12 months in light of these consumer shifts? David Taylor : Certainly. All good questions -- many questions there. First, the -- if I look at what's happened for the last couple of years, if anything, it's just reinforced the set of choices that we've made. What we are seeing and the pandemic's, frankly, accelerated is consumers are right now moving more and more back to trusted brands. The pandemic has actually put many, many more people back in their homes. And if you think about health, hygiene and cleaning categories, and we said it a lot, and sometimes I think people get tired of it, but it's categories where performance drives brand choice really matters. And I think it matters even more now.  We were seeing that before the pandemic because we grew very, very well in the first half of the year, 6%, and we saw it through the pandemic. But those -- that focus on health, hygiene and cleaning and are having things that really matter. And one of the other points that I think in the strategy that's really working and it fits what's going on right now is because of the shift to e-commerce, there's tremendous pressure on retailers, and frankly, all participants on profitability. So if your strategy is one where innovation grows the category size, when you do that, you create the larger pie, which allows both the retailer to increase their profitability, to manufacture, and it doesn't put the rest of the industry in a bad place. It's actually in a better place. So to me, I believe the strategy is actually moving in the right place.  You mentioned ESG, I think it's another area where P&G has particular strengths. Well before it was in vogue, P&G has always had a position of being a very strong corporate citizen. We have stood up in both social sustainability and environmental sustainability with sustained efforts in those areas. It's the way we operate. It's consistent with our values. And so as there's been a greater focus on that, I think that as well matters because consumers more and more, as well as all stakeholders, one on the values of the company is behind the brand. And I think that also plays well to the strategy. What I feel one of the things best about is we have not had to make big shifts in our strategy as a result of what's happened. It's just reinforced the importance of it.  And the final point I'd make is the organizational changes that we made, which are putting more accountability closer to where our consumers or customers are and recognizing the inherent strength of our people and capability of the organization in unleashing it to me has shown sequentially stronger and stronger results and better and better activation of that strategy. And you saw it going into the crisis because, again, the crisis accelerated trends that were happening and our people stepped up magnificently well and beyond trying to deliver the business. They initiated many of these projects to, can we make mask and donate them? Can we make hand sanitizers and donate some of those? Face shields, we've never made. But a group -- 2 different groups decided they could repurpose some of our packaging equipment and turn that packaging equipment into something that can make face shields, and we've shipped hundreds of thousands of face shields to the medical community. But it just shows you that when you have engaged people that care about both the consumers and the communities, what they can do. So it's just we accelerated the choices we've made. And Kevin, I think it's put us in a very good position coming out of the pandemic because of the capabilities we've been developing. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : One thing I wanted to ask about was the productivity. So beyond the 6% organic sales growth this quarter, the productivity was really remarkable, the 440 basis points in total between cost of goods and SG&A. And that was on a very strong comparison and more than double, I think, the run rate through the fiscal year-to-date. So maybe anything about what's been done kind of differently. I know productivity is typically strongest in the fourth quarter. But as you carry forward into '21 and beyond, are there things that you've been able to do differently, cost-savings opportunities, productivity opportunities that kind of presented themselves given the change in the environment? So we can be a bit informed in terms of that productivity going forward. David Taylor : I'll make one comment, again, I'll turn it to Jon on this one. We've talked a great deal about the fact that all buckets, all spin pools have been looked at and we've leveraged to me both the digital ecosystem as well as the capabilities of our organization to make substantive changes. And one of the best illustrations of that is what happened when the pandemic hit, we started to see both attendance issues and supply challenges. We've learned time and time again that when we ask groups of people to step up and address change, they can do it incredibly well. We've had plants that have operated at 90% of their effectiveness with half the people in the short run, demonstrating again there's more there. But I'll turn it to Jon to get the specifics, but both the gross margin and operating margin to meet progress has been sustained over the last several years. And if you look forward, we see still tremendous amount in both media. We see with many of our nonconsumer-facing spending areas as well as cost of goods. Jon? Jon Moeller : Just two comments. One, I'm glad you realize, and I know you always have, that the productivity savings do accrue more to the back half of the year than the front half of the year because that's going to be important as you think about your quarterly cadence for estimates next year because the same thing, the same pattern will hold true. We have learned a ton, as David was indicating, as a result of the experience we've been through the last 4 months. And one of the things I believe we've learned is that there is even more opportunity than we thought. I'll just give you one simple and obvious example, travel and entertainment. We never really -- I don't think could have imagined that we'd be accomplishing all we are with effectively 0 travel and entertainment. And that's not the right long-term answer. But the right long-term answer is not what we were doing previously. We've all become much more effective working in very different ways with digital tools, as David indicated. I think the general comfort with digital tools that are available to us makes it much more likely that we will seek those tools out in terms of improving our work efficiency and effectiveness across all of our activity systems. So there is -- David mentioned the manufacturing efficiency, which is clearly an opportunity as well. So we continue to be committed to productivity as a fundamental foundation stone in our strategy. It enables the investment in superiority, which grows markets and then flows through the income statement. Operator : Next question will come from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Stephen Powers : So we've heard a lot of CPG companies, particularly across food and beverages, but I think across the board, take this moment to or aggressively simplified base-level assortments to maximize merchant availability and maximize turns. I guess, can you talk about what steps you've taken to do likewise? And also at what pace you expect there -- you to be layering in a bit more variation, those things, hopefully, you catch up to supply constraints and things start to normalize? And I guess the real question is, when you do start to layer in more variation, would you expect that to take more of the form of you bringing back some of the things that you most recently cut out? Or is this an opportunity to redirect innovation and branding resources in new directions to best drive market growth in the future? David Taylor : Again, several questions. First, when the pandemic hit, yes, in some categories, we went to more simplified SKU lineups in order to maximize the capacity of the high turn items. And I'm sure we and many others did that. And we learned through that as well. In some cases, where there were some smaller volume SKUs that meet special consumer needs, and they will come back. There's also some opportunities for some continued SKU rationalization to better serve consumers and meet the retailers' needs. So both of those are happening. It's very category specific on what we're doing. But I'd say, in general, there's a sharper look at can we have a more focused portfolio with really differentiated products. So I think, yes, that will continue.  The change in manufacturing to me, in order to adjust the agility needed, I think is one of the other things that's really been an area that we're working before, but coming into the crisis and then through it. Looking at business continuity plans, the total supply system, look at the appropriate number of suppliers in order to ensure you have the agility to react to instantaneous capacity swings that we're seeing. I think there's all been learning in those areas. I expect on the other side of this, again, varying by category, but there will be some streamlining in order to meet the needs. And in some of the categories, because there will be a sustained increase in consumption, we're looking at what we need to do to ensure we have the right capacity to meet those needs. Because I think a lot of the spike that we've seen is not going to go away in some of these categories. Consumers are developing new habits. And I think many of us believe that will last well beyond the pandemic. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : Another quarter with very strong market share momentum. Can you discuss what you're seeing in terms of competitive response from key competitors on either the ad spend from a promotion front more towards the end of fiscal Q4 or so far in July? And how do you ensure that P&G's market share momentum continues going forward, if you do experience greater competitive intensity as competitors are likely to sit still here with share losses? And also, Jon, you touched on products, consumer trade down and private label share pressure potentially in this macro environment a few months ago on the Q3 call. Maybe just give us an update on where we stand today versus your viewpoint a few months back? David Taylor : Yes. First, on the market trends, our market share, global market share has actually strengthened through the year. We were up 0.3 for the total year, 0.4 for 6 months, 0.5 for the past 3. In terms of the last quarter, in terms of promotion intensity activity, as you would imagine, in categories where there's supply constraints, you'd see less promotion as everybody focuses on meeting the basic supply needs of the customers and the consumers. And on the categories of tissue/towel, which is our Family Care, Home Care, which will just surface and air, that's largely continued into this fiscal year as the demand hasn't ceased. And if you take the U.S., it's our largest market we wanted to focus on. As you know, when you watch the daily news and you hit the daily news, there's just a lot of debate on how much it will open up or even stop or even go back.  So I think the focus on Home, Personal Care, cleaning and hygiene is likely to sustain itself. And so I don't expect in the short run dramatic changes in the promotion environment, although, again, it's very category specific, and in many cases, very country specific. We've chosen to stay extraordinarily focused on the strategy, which is focused on investing in the superiority across the 5 elements we've talked. And through this last couple of years, that's consistently worked in both high promotion environments, which we see in some countries and categories, and in this last 3 to 4 months when there was lower promotion because of supply constraints. And as I think about next year, there will be, I'm sure, competitors will come in and they'll have innovation and there'll be changes in their promotion strategy. But we've tried not to get distracted from the strategy that's working and, again, across the balance of countries and categories, that continues to work, and I think it will. Jon? Jon Moeller : On consumer trade-down, as we've talked before, we're not immune to that, and that could become an increasing dynamic going forward to the extent unemployment grows and stimulus and support shrinks. But as we've also talked, we're in a much better position to deal with that than we have been historically. And I think the environment actually helps us as well. So let me quickly unpack that. We have focused our portfolio, as we've talked several times over in this call, in categories where performance drives brand choice. By definition then, a portion of the value equation is performance. And to the extent that we have an advantage in performance, that's noticeably -- that's noticeable and obvious. That, along with a fair price, albeit a small premium, is viewed as offering value. And we have a much higher percentage of our portfolio that's well positioned in that context than as we headed into the last recession. And the needs for performance, so the degree to which performance affects our consumer's personal value equation, vis-\u00e0-vis, price is higher than it's ever been, which also works in our favor. The -- to date, this can change, obviously. But to date, if you look at private label market shares as one proxy of trade down, we're not seeing it. Private label shares in aggregate across our categories in the U.S. were down 40 basis points in the last 3 months. They were essentially flat in Europe. Last point, we have significantly built out, not always perfectly, but we've built out our pricing ladders. We didn't have items like Tide simply available for consumers in the last recession, and we have many more of those currently. So again, we're not immune. It's real. The best way to attack it is with performance, noticeably superior performance at a fair value to have the right pack sizes available for consumers who are limited in terms of their cash outlay and double down on the strategy that's working versus stepping back. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC. Nik Modi : Jon, I was hoping you can just give us some more context on the guidance for next year on the top line just from a geographic perspective, just so we can understand kind of how you're thinking about the enterprise markets versus some of the focus markets and then thinking about developed Europe. That would be super helpful. Jon Moeller : So the first piece of context I'd provide on the top line guidance for next year, because I mentioned in our prepared remarks, it's all based on what we're expecting on market growth, and then we would expect to grow slightly ahead of that and continue building share. And as I mentioned, we see markets growing modestly, probably 1% to 3%. And so the 2% to 4% range is consistent with building share in that environment. If we look at our own forecast, Nick, for top line growth in enterprise versus the balance of the market, they're both within that range. So we're going to continue to expect not only total company growth, but both focus on enterprise market growth on both the top and bottom line. Clearly, in the current context, so let's just use that as a proxy for the future, we're seeing very strong growth in U.S. and China, as we've talked. If you look at the quarter, growth in Europe was much more modest, but that has picked up recently. And clearly, while we expect growth from the enterprise markets, they're currently the most challenged just in terms of the operating environment and the economic -- both economic and health pressures that families are feeling. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Olivia Tong : You guys have clearly demonstrated better execution. Obviously, sales or competition. So just a few questions about how you think about continuing to drive that growth. Does more to come from continuing to grow into areas that have been disproportionately grown already? Or is it more around turning around underperformers? Or do you expect, so for example Baby Care, what -- can you talk about what you're doing there to turn around that performance? Maybe if you could talk about the innovation pipeline, since obviously, SK-II is going to be a bit challenging in the near term. And then how much of this -- you obviously talked about private label coming down. So how much of this is coming from established players versus the long tail of sort of newest brands potentially fading away? David Taylor : Olivia, first, just the last thing you said, whether most of this coming from the established brands or long tail, our core is going very well. Fabric care is growing. Fabric, tissue/towel, Home Care, Health Care, all going very well. Our Beauty business grew very well last year. Skin Care, Personal Care, APDO, antiperspirant and deodorant, all that grew well. So the core grew well, and again, it's central to the strategy, and it's obviously the biggest part of the business. And the 2 biggest markets grew were U.S. and China. If I look forward, in order for us to be a dependable long-term grower, we have to grow the core. And the strategy is focused on making sure the core is healthy. And the core has to continue to extend to address new benefits that are relevant in those categories. And there's many, many examples we've given in the past of that, and certainly, we get more of the Home Care examples that you see out with Microban and many of the other things that occurred on Mr. Clean brand and Febreze brands over time. We also believe in RC and certainly, some of the additional investments we've made are paying out, both internally developed innovation as well as some of the acquired innovation. Our track record is getting increasingly better on those as well. And this year, we have certainly some things coming out of our P&G venture. But that's a small portion of the total company. But what it does speak to is innovation is driven core, core and more and then in new benefit spaces, new jobs that we can do.  To me, it speaks to just the whole innovation process is working in the company. But I fully expect for the year that we're going into right now and the next several years, the core will be the biggest driver of that. And there's still significant opportunities. So what I wouldn't think is we're in mature categories. 4 years ago, people said we are mature categories. And now you see big established businesses and take Fabric & Home Care, that it have moved from low single digits to mid-single digits to high single digits in many, many countries. And if you get down to the next level and look at household penetration by item, and what you see is many of them are in the 10% to 30% range and 10% to 30%, which means the majority of consumers haven't used the product in the last year and haven't experienced the new benefit of the improved performance that we've built. So -- and we've gone back to rediscover the opportunity to build household penetration, new users, grow the market size, leverage superiority to bring their users in and then leverage additional benefits to trade people up to higher order performance. That's happened across the 10 core categories. And then when you do it well, you grow share. And probably the best example I gave earlier was in Personal Health Care where virtually every brand grew share over 3, 6 and 12 months. And it's because of new innovation that they bought to the market. It's delighting the consumers. So core, core and more and then our venture effort to me is it's now producing new brands with Zevo, an update coming out this year. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein with Evercore. Robert Ottenstein : Great. I'd like to drill down on the U.S. e-commerce business. And if you could address three aspects. One, can you give a rough sense of the kind of growth and growth momentum in the business, kind of March to June? What percent of sales? And how sticky this is looking at? And then in response to that, what are the sort of changes that you are doing organizationally, either with the sales force or the supply chain, to meet the increased demand for e-commerce as a channel? And then finally, how do you assess your competitive advantage in e-commerce versus brick and mortar? David Taylor : We'll take a cut at some of those. I'm not sure I have all the specifics. Although some of those, we can certainly get you afterwards. The e-commerce business has been growing for now several years in the 30% to 40% range. As you know, we're most developed in China. The U.S. is also growing extremely fast, and we expect it to continue. We've adjusted -- and again, it fits with the strategy. We've adjusted our supply chain, including our packaging capability, to be able to meet the needs of e-commerce, consumers and e-commerce aggregators that had different needs because of the -- instead of shipping it in a case in a pilot load to a store. It's in each going through a different path to the consumer, and that's worked well. One of the things we've worked very hard on and is present today is we want e-commerce shares growing in absolute, and we want e-commerce shares to be equal or higher than their off-line shares, and we're working to have the same profitability. And we've made very good progress on both of those as well in the U.S. and China and in Europe. And that will continue to be a priority. We want to be agnostic to where the consumers buy the product. In the most recent period, the U.S. e-commerce business that was up 50% in fiscal '20, we all know there's a spike driven by COVID. How much of that will sustain? We'll see. But I think many are developing new habits. So I think we are prepared for that to continue to grow at that pace and meet the consumers' needs and we've developed. The last point I'd make, additional capability because we've worked with many of the e-commerce companies in the bricks-and-mortar to omni providers to ensure that we minimize the cost from when we make it to when the consumer gets it, working with them to reduce the transportation or last mile. So all of those are active strategies. We can -- other than the 50% U.S., if there's more specifics that you need, ask Jon so he can to follow up with you after this meeting to get any more specifics by quarter. Jon Moeller : I think, Robert, we are -- to your question of are we relatively advantaged within that broadly defined channel, including omni commerce and brick and click, et cetera. I continue to believe we are. That's no reason to rest. But as you and I have talked before, it is in reality a limited assortment environment from a practical shopping standpoint. And as a result of that, the barriers to entry are very, very high. The need to be on the first and second page of a search, preferences large established superior brands, which we have. Again, no guarantee of the future and no reason to rest. But we embrace the evolution of markets towards e-commerce. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Cody Ross : It's actually Cody on for Jason this morning. I just want to hit the Home Care section a little bit. You guys cited 30% growth this quarter. How does the supply-demand balance look right now across the industry? And from a supply point of view, are you guys investing in more capacity right now? And how much capacity have you seen come on already? Or do you expect to come on as competitors invest in more capacity? David Taylor : Okay. Cody, let me take a couple of those and some of the data. Certainly, I don't know what's happening with competitors on capacity. Home Care had an outstanding year. And again, in Home Care, in our world, is Dish Care, surface care and air care. So those categories and those brands globally. The category grew about 16% this year -- or our results rather, we grew ahead of the category and grew share. In terms of capacity, there are areas like our Microban launch that went out in February that we are capacity constrained now because we launched right as it was hitting, and the notes to us and the demand spiked. Today, the run rate is now in a couple of hundred million dollar range, which is more than we expected at the time we launched. We expected more of a -- more typical build although we knew it was a very attractive product because of the sustained surface benefit -- surface scale benefits it offered. In areas like Swiffer and hand dish, we're also working very hard to make sure we get inventories back up, but the demand spiked. You can imagine with people now fixing more meals at home are Dawn and around the world, Fairy. And our automatic dish, which would be cascading around the world Fairy, both of those have spiked. And we've seen the Home Care category, if I take the U.S., sometimes the category size over many of these weeks has been in the 1.30 to 1.40 range. We've been able to meet most of that need. There are again some specific items where we're working very hard to increase the capacity, and that will be coming on and kind of feather in over the next couple of quarters. But we continue to ship very, very well. And we're getting back both shelves, and eventually, the customer inventory and our inventory is back in line, but we're not there yet as we close the fiscal year and certainly into July. And as of through this July, we have not seen the demand slow down very much yet in the Home Care area, which bodes well for the year. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark Astrachan : So wanted to touch on some of the changing consumer presence commentary and talk about SK-II in particular and trying to ask whether you still think it makes sense to own a brand with as much volatility as it has relative to the base portfolio these days. Obviously, it's had a lot of contribution to growth in recent years. So I guess can you reassess kind of broadly? Can you kind of comment a bit about that specifically in terms of how you're thinking about the portfolio today would be great? David Taylor : First, the first question, how do we feel about SK-II? Very committed and thrilled that we have it. There was certainly a bump the last 4 months that hit us hard with mainly travel retail business. But if you look even at the last few months in China, growing very nicely now. And as we go into the year works, we continue to be optimistic about the brand. Consumers love the brand. And we have brands focused on meeting consumer needs and SK-II does a great job. It's had several years of sustained top and bottom line growth. And frankly, I'm not discouraged at all by a 4- or 5-month dip because, largely, the travel retail business got impacted. In the markets that it competes with the consumers in where it is present, it continues to do well, and it's already starting to rebound. So now we're very committed to SK-II. And if I step back at the global Skin and Personal Care business, which includes, again, the Personal Care, APDO, Skin Care and Prestige skin, that whole category, even with what happened to SK-II, grew nicely last year, in the upper mid-single digits, indicating that the broad portfolio can weather a hit like that, and it's consistently the global Beauty has consistently been performing well for the last couple of years. And so they're optimistic again that the business that was travel retail will find itself somewhere else if consumers looking for the brand will go where they can find it. And we've seen that more recently with the rebound in China with SK-II. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust. William Chappell : Could you just talk about kind of your outlook over the next year for the Grooming category? I mean especially kind of worldwide, I mean, how it plays out? You have, obviously, corona beards in the U.S. So nice to read that mullets are coming back in Australia over the weekend. And so anything you see there that kind of how, as we come out of this, or is the category permanently impaired? Or do you see it slowly get growth as we move into calendar '21? Just any thoughts would be great. David Taylor : Sure. While we've seen a hit in the COVID period, Grooming up through January was actually making very good progress. And even with the COVID hit and people at home and less shaving because of people not going outside or may not going outside, it still grew this last year. And if I take up through January, the first 7 months of the year, it was growing faster. It was the fastest growth we've seen in several years. We've actually seen an increase this year in new users. We've got the fastest new user growth we've seen in many years, which means people are coming in. What we have done, though, and this is important, we have a -- certainly, the male Blades & Razors is the biggest part of the business, but we have male and female. We have the full ladder, including disposables, which have again grown. And now we've gotten a very fast-growing appliance business, call it Braun, which is growing share, and it's growing double digit right now as people have moved to a dry form in some places. And then we've launched a King C. Gillette initiative to address men with hair. So the shave category is really now embraced. The category is growing and is taking care of people with here, without facial hair, men, women, all price points. And as it does that, to me, it's right now creating a strategy that will allow it to grow in most environments. And I believe we will see, as people go back to look in offices and outside the home, we'll see a pickup in the wet shave rate. In the meantime, we'll continue to see very robust growth in dry save, very robust growth in this King C. Gillette new brand that addresses many of the tools needed for people with facial hair for grooming facial here. So it's also a highly profitable business that continues to -- that we're very committed to long term. One other comment, we grew double digits in China this last year, which is another indication that as the economy came back and while it's not post-COVID, China has returned more to a more normal operating environment than most countries and Grooming is growing double digit in that country, which, again, tells me that the broader portfolio can and will grow in the future and create value for the company. Operator : And your final question will come from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : I'm glad to hear you well and congrats on the results. If you can give us the cadence of the fourth quarter exit rate or July to date. From your guidance, it seems we're taking some destocking in the U.S. but can you help us think about the assumptions for your sales curve, including a potential more mild cold season ahead? Or just the market share momentum you spoke throughout this call should offset a shifting against consumption dynamics? Jon Moeller : Andrea, as you can probably appreciate, the monthly cadence, if you will, is very different by category, by market and it has been volatile. Recently, it's hard to make coherent sense out of it. But the overall thought that I would give you is that it's remained strong throughout. July has remained strong. But we also have to remember that all of that's happened, for instance, in a U.S. context with significant financial stimulus. And we don't know as we sit here today, what the future of that is going to look like and whether it will exist. And that's just one example of the pretty dramatic unknowns that make it difficult for me to say because July has started off well, we should assume the first quarter is going to be strong. I can't say that. David Taylor : One other -- just to offer is, to a large degree, it depends on what you believe the markets in broad will grow. I think Jon's earlier statement, and certainly, our view is we will grow ahead of the market, and our innovation will be a stimulant to market growth. But there are macro factors that are big enough, whether it's the recession, the COVID impact, disruptions to supply chain, but it's very hard to predict. We ended the quarter with good momentum. And certainly, as we go into the quarter, good momentum. The health, hygiene and cleaning categories, we think will be focused -- will be focused categories for consumers. And it's your guess as good as ours on when people will and increasing in numbers would turn back to offices and be working outside the home. At this point in time right now, it looks like in the U.S., that's slowing down, but it varies all over the world. In aggregate, we think we're well positioned for whatever comes at us to do better than what the market would give. And we'll work very hard to make sure that we continue to be good contributors to our consumers, our customers and to the communities in which we operate. Thank you. Thank you all. Jon Moeller : Thanks, everybody. Jon and Kerry and myself will be available the balance of the day. We're at our normal work numbers, feel free to contact us. I know it's a busy day for many of you. I will also be here tomorrow. Thanks. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to Procter & Gamble\u2019s Quarter-end Conference Call. Today\u2019s event is being recorded for replay. This discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G\u2019s most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the Company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from these projections. As required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the Company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business trends and has posted on its Investor Relations website, www.pginvestor.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Now, I will turn the call over to P&G\u2019s Vice Chairman, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller. Jon Moeller : Good morning. We\u2019d like to start by expressing our sincere hope that you and your families remain safe and are well. A good quarter isn\u2019t difficult to explain. So, we\u2019re going to keep our prepared remarks brief with just a little over 10 minutes and then turn straight to your questions. July-September quarter provided a very strong start to the fiscal year, enabling us to increase guidance for organic sales growth, raise guidance for core earnings per share growth, increase guidance for adjusted free cash flow productivity and raise our commitment for cash return to shareowners, organic sales up more than 9%, 7 points of volume growth, 1 point of positive mix and 1 point of price. We built strong momentum, leading up to the crisis with 6% organic sales growth in calendar year 2019. We maintained 6% growth in the first half of calendar 2020, overcoming significant challenges, including the lockdown in China, closure of the travel retail, electro, specialty beauty and away-from-home channels, operational challenges, safely staffing our facilities and sourcing materials necessary to maintain and in some categories significantly increased production, to serve heightened consumer cleaning, health and hygiene needs. And we accelerated to 9% this quarter against a strong 7% base period comparison. Strong momentum reflected the underlying strength of our brands and the appropriateness of the strategy, which is driving our business, pre, during and at some point post-COVID. Broad-based growth, U.S. organic sales up 16%, Greater China up 12%, focused markets up 11% and enterprise markets which are significantly impacted by the COVID pandemic, up 5%; 9 out of 10 product categories grew organic sales. Home Care up more than 30%, Oral Care up mid-teens, Family Care up double-digits, Personal Health Care, Fabric Care, Feminine Care, Hair Care and Skin and Personal Care up high singles; Grooming up mid singles, Baby Care down low singles; aggregate market share growth of 30 basis points with 30 of our top 50 country category combinations holding our growing share; e-commerce sales up approximately 50% for the quarter. Turning to earnings, core earnings per share up 19%, currency neutral core earnings per share up 22%. Within this, core gross margin expansion of 140 basis points, up 170 basis points ex-FX. Core operating margin up 300 basis points, up 350 basis points excluding FX. Adjusted free cash flow productivity of 95%. We returned $4 billion of value to shareowners, $2 billion of dividends paid and $2 billion of P&G stock repurchase. In summary, a very strong start to the fiscal year, strong volume, sales and market share trends, strong operating earnings, margins advancing, strong core earnings per share growth. We built strong momentum heading into the COVID crisis and have been able to maintain this through the most recent quarter, supporting a guidance increase for all key financial metrics, organic sales, core earnings per share, cash productivity, and cash return. As we outlined each of the last two quarters, we\u2019ve established three priorities that have been guiding our actions and our choices in this crisis period. First is ensuring the health and safety of our P&G colleagues around the world. Second maximizing the availability of products we produce to help people and their families with their cleaning, health and hygiene needs. These products are more important than ever, given the needs created by the current crisis, increased awareness of health and hygiene, and the additional time we\u2019re all spending at home. Third, supporting communities, relief agencies and people who are on the frontlines of this global pandemic, with product donations, PPE production, financial support and using our marketing and communications expertise to encourage consumers to support public health measures as well as the spread of the virus. These priorities are completely congruent with our strategic choices which remain the right ones. These strategic choices are the foundation for balanced top and bottom line growth and long-term value creation. As you know, we focused our portfolio on daily use products and categories where performance plays a significant role in brand choice. In these performance-driven categories, we\u2019ve raised the bar on all aspects of superiority, product, package, consumer communication, retail execution and value. Superior offerings delivered with superior execution drive market growth. Leading category growth with superior offerings mathematically builds market share and builds business for our retail partners. We\u2019ve made investments to strengthen the long-term health and the competitiveness of our brands. And we\u2019ll continue to invest to extend our margin of advantage and quality of execution, improving options for consumers around the world. The strategic need for this investment, the short-term need to manage through this crisis, and the ongoing need to drive balance top and bottom line growth, including margin expansion underscore the importance of ongoing productivity. We\u2019re driving cost savings and cash productivity in all facets of our business, up and down the income statement and across the balance sheet. Next, success in our highly competitive industry requires agility that comes with a mindset of constructive disruption, a willingness to change, adapt, and create new trends and technologies that will shape our industry for the future. In our current environment, that agility and constructive disruption mindset are even more important. Last, our new organizational structure yields a more empowered, agile and accountable organization with little overlap or redundancy, flow into new demands, seamlessly supporting each other to deliver against our priorities around the world. These strategic choices we\u2019ve made, portfolio superiority, productivity, constructive disruption, and organization structure and culture are not independent strategies. They reinforce and build on each other. When executed well, they grow markets, which in turn grow share, sales and profit. We believe our strategies, the success we\u2019ve had behind them and an increased societal focus on health, hygiene and the clean home all bode well for the future. We believe P&G is well-positioned to serve consumers\u2019 heightened needs and their changing behaviors, and to serve the changing needs of our retail and distributor partners, all of which are critical to long-term value-creation. We like our long-term prospects, though the near term will continue to be challenging, and it\u2019s a little more difficult to predict. Our near-term outlook begins with an assumption of how underlying consumer markets will develop. This by itself is highly uncertain. The reality is that COVID cases are increasing in many parts of the world, without the resources infrastructure, or in some cases the will to effectively manage it. We\u2019ll likely be operating without broadly available vaccines or advanced therapeutic through fiscal \u201821. This could prompt tighter containment policies and dramatically reduced mobility, which would affect employment and overall incomes, potentially leading to a deeper and longer recession across large parts of the world. In the U.S., it\u2019s unclear how long we\u2019ll be operating at high unemployment levels, and when and how much mitigating economic stimulus will be available. There continues to be social unrest and economic distress in many parts of the world that also affect the prospects for category growth. These same dynamics can result in an increased cost to operate and there is an ongoing risk of supply chain disruption, our operations or those of our suppliers. Against this challenging backdrop, we\u2019re still holding ourselves to an expectation of meaningful growth, top line and bottom line and expect to be highly cash generative. With a strong first quarter as a base, we\u2019re increasing our fiscal year guidance. We\u2019re raising our organic sales growth guidance from a range of 2% to 4% to a range of 4% to 5%, which includes some quarter-to-quarter ramp-down from Q1 as retail inventories are fully replenished and as promotions are partially reestablished. We expect to grow market share in aggregate for the year. We\u2019re increasing our core earnings per share growth guidance from a range of 3% to 7% to a range of 5% to 8% versus prior year core earnings per share of $5.12. This bottom line outlook includes headwinds of approximately $325 million after tax, a foreign exchange, $150 million from the combination of higher interest expense and lower interest income and $50 million after tax of higher freight costs. These headwinds should be partially offset by $175 million after tax of commodity costs tailwinds. Fiscal 2021 will continue our long track record of significant cash generation and cash return to shareowners. We\u2019re raising our target for adjusted free cash flow productivity from 90% to around 95%. We continue to expect to pay approximately $8 billion in dividends and are increasing our outlook for share repurchase from a range of $6 billion to $8 billion to a range of $7 billion to $9 billion. Combined, dividends and share repurchase are planned to return $15 billion to $17 billion of cash to shareowners this fiscal year. This outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates, current commodity prices and current foreign exchange rates. Significant currency weakness, commodity cost increases, additional geopolitical disruption, major production stoppages or store closures are not anticipated within these guidance ranges. Wrapping up, we continue to execute winning strategies, a portfolio in daily-use categories where performance drives brand choice, superiority in products, packages, consumer communication, retail execution and value, productivity in all areas of cost and cash, constructive disruption in all facets of the operation and improved organization focus, agility and accountability. We feel we continue to have the right priorities to deal with the immediate challenges the Company\u2019s facing, ensuring employee health and safety, maximizing product availability, and helping society overcome the challenges of the crisis. We\u2019re stepping forward, not back. We\u2019re doubling down to serve consumers and our communities. We\u2019re investing in the superiority of our brands and the capabilities of our organization, always with our eyes fixed on long-term balanced growth and value creation. With that, I\u2019d be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Geez, first question. So, many areas ago. I guess, I wanted to jump off of probably one of the higher order questions, Jon. You mentioned you\u2019re excited, enthused about the consumers\u2019 increased focus on health, hygiene and home. What\u2019s your view on the durability of those related behavioral changes that we\u2019ve seen over the last six, eight, nine months? Do you expect it to mean revert to pre-COVID? If so, what\u2019s the duration? And if not, why not? Jon Moeller : We do expect that there\u2019s some stickiness to new habits that are being formed, and new awareness that\u2019s been raised. It\u2019s hard for us to see in our interactions with consumers, that we\u2019re going to snap back and revert to the same attitudes and the same behaviors that we had collectively pre-COVID. Even things like the amount of inventory, pantry inventory I keep. In some ways, this is analogous that some of us remember our grandparents, for example, having survived the great depression, and they continued to hold on some more food and canned items that I could ever understand. But, it was because of what they\u2019ve been through. Consumer habits, once they\u2019re established in our categories are rarely reversed. On occasion, under duress, they will be. But generally, once people start using a category, once they form a habit, it\u2019s phase. I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be some level of reversion. But, we do expect a permanent change at some level as well. Duration, your call is as good as mine. I have no ability to predict what\u2019s going to happen here from a viral standpoint or from a medical solution standpoint. Jason English : I appreciate the perspective. In that context, as you think about your portfolio construct, does it change the way you think about where you want to play? Jon Moeller : On the margin, it can have an impact on where we want to play. We\u2019re happy with each of our current categories. The question is, are there additional opportunities that we want to be able to access? So, for example, we launched a hand sanitizer in the U.S. under the Safeguard brand name. You\u2019re aware of the Microban 24 surface disinfectant, which we\u2019re working hard to increase capacity on so we can meet very-high demands for that product. So generally, again, our portfolio is going to daily-use categories, performance drives brand choice, heavily centered on health, hygiene and a clean home is going to serve us very well on the situation, just as it did prior. But, the situation does present additional opportunities to step up and serve and help consumers with their health, hygiene and clean home needs. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein with Evercore. Rob Ottenstein : So, 7% volume growth, 1 percent price, 1 per cent mix, very balanced. Kind of a two-part question. How are you thinking about market share, how much of a priority is that in this environment? And kind of then, looking at e-commerce, we\u2019ve done a lot of work on the U.S. e-commerce business and did a deep dive on that using numerator data. And what came out of that was a little mixed. Certain categories doing extremely well, like Crest just killing it in e-commerce, but based on the numbers and data we saw diapers, bath tissue, paper towels appear to losing share in e-commerce. So, love to kind of a get a sense of how you\u2019re thinking about market share and then particularly market share in e-commerce, and where -- whether in terms of e-commerce whether you are hitting kind of the nodes of superiority that you\u2019re looking for with the rest of your business? Thank you. Jon Moeller : Thanks, Robert. I want to start in a slightly different place, but I\u2019m going to bring it right around to the core of your question. So, be patient with me. We are maniacally focused on increasing and leading market growth. And when we do that, we do that with superior products, continuously increasing our margin of advantage, meeting additional needs, solve intention points across the portfolio. When we disproportionately are able to drive market growth, mathematically, we build share. And that share growth is much more sustainable achieved that way and is much generally much more profitable than if we were sourcing market share by taking business from other companies. So, we\u2019d rather create than take, and in the process more sustainably build market share, which is very important, as well as sales and profit. In terms of e-commerce, it\u2019s a very competitive marketplace, just like other channels that we compete in. So, there are always ups and downs across categories. But, we find that the same general strategy that I articulated in our prepared remarks and that I just described parts of it and what I just provided is highly relevant in e-commerce, just like it is in brick and mortar. And we don\u2019t see a lot of -- there\u2019s some, but we don\u2019t see a ton of differentiation between our ability to succeed in an e-commerce format and a offline format, when we execute our strategies and when our products in categories where performance drives brand choice are truly superior. So, that\u2019s our focus. We look carefully at overall share progress online versus offline and margin progress online versus offline in an area, which is always dangerous. Of course, operationally, we move to lower levels of aggregation. We\u2019re indifferent between online and offline shopping, which is exactly where we want to be. I mentioned we grew e-commerce sales 50% in the quarter that we just completed. E-commerce sales are now probably 11% to 12% of our total. So, they\u2019re important. And we\u2019re just as focused on being successful in that channel as we are the others. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : So, Jon, I just wanted to better understand the implied healthier organic sales growth guidance for the fiscal year after Q1 strength. It\u2019s only about 3% at the endpoint of your full year range versus 9% this quarter, doesn\u2019t seem to really moved up the Q2 through Q4 implied forecast, despite the Q1 upside. So, just trying to understand is that more just related to uncertain environment here post COVID? Are there other specific factors driving that forward sequential caution, you\u2019ve mentioned a couple in your prepared remarks. So, a bit more detail will be helpful there. And just on promotion, given that they come up in your prepared remarks. Is the U.S. promotional environment -- is that returning to more of a normalized level? And how do you think of our calendar 2021 versus 2020 on that front? Just given it was an abnormally depressed promotional base. Jon Moeller : No surprise to you or anyone on this call, we continue to operate in a highly uncertain environment with many more drivers of that uncertainty than we\u2019re historically accustomed to. And that certainly helps frame guidance, if not guidance ranges. Second, we\u2019ve got a long way to go. So, we\u2019re through one quarter, we\u2019ve got three more quarters to execute on in this very dynamic environment. Third, market growth, which is where we start in our outlook process, looks to be kind of 3% to 4% on a normalized basis. That\u2019s global. And so, 4% to 5%, as our new fiscal year guidance range is consistent with our desire to build market share, but I think realistic in its approach. Also, the quarter we just completed has two elements, and you mentioned one of them that will drive a higher top line result. The first is, there\u2019s been -- there was inventory replenishment to the trade during the quarter that was probably worth a point or two. And you mentioned as well lower levels of promotion. We still have categories where we have replenishment work to do. So, some of that benefit will carry forward into subsequent quarters, but many of our categories are for now replenished. And from a promotion standpoint, we\u2019ve returned to somewhat normal levels of promotion in most categories in the U.S. except those where we still have work to catch up on replenishment, where demand exceeds our ability -- our current ability to supply, and that would be our Home Care business, our tissue/towel business and parts of our Health Care business. We do expect some normalization of promotion rates in the back half of the year. So, as we get into 2021, exactly what the cadence is of that and exactly what level things return to is not entirely clear. We\u2019re going to continue where we have the opportunity to prioritize spend on innovation and equity. There is nothing proprietary in promotion. But, we will be competitive from a promotion standpoint. I know that answer lacks the specificity you are looking for. The best I can do with the current state of a knowledge and the current state of volatility. I think, Dara, the question behind the question is, is there a possible upside to the guidance range? I think the answer is yes. But, I would also hasten to add that there\u2019s also downside. There is just a lot of moving pieces right now. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : I wanted to ask a little bit about fields of play. As you\u2019ve mentioned, kind of new opportunities out there and in the release also had specifically mentioned the Safeguard launch. I was curious though also about the Personal Health Care business because that\u2019s another area where, just like Home Care, you\u2019ve been investing in sort of building up a greater presence pre-COVID. And it would seem that this new environment would also open up some interesting incremental opportunities in Personal Health Care. So, could you just talk a little bit about that business, kind of where -- if you are spending differently, focusing on new areas, what the more international footprint of that business opens up for you versus where you were several years ago? I think, that could be really helpful. Jon Moeller : Sure, Lauren. That is a -- Personal Health Care is a very attractive field of play, to use your description. It\u2019s one that, you are right, we\u2019ve been investing behind. We purchased the German Merck OTC portfolio, which we\u2019re still in the middle of integrating, but very successfully. Our top-line growth on that business and our heritage P&G Personal Health Care business outside the United States, to your question of international, is growing at growth rates -- very attractive growth rates, high singles, double digits in some cases, ahead of the plan when we purchased those assets. And the good news is, cost synergies are also coming in nicely. So, that does give us confidence to continue looking for smart ideas to expand the current portfolio and to look for additional opportunities to create value with. And we\u2019ll be doing that. The German Merck OTC assets gave us about $1 billion sales international business, again, combined with things like Vicks and the heritage P&G portfolio. So, we now have a meaningful presence in many parts of the world that puts us -- and we\u2019ve secured capabilities that put us in a position to drive this business and do it profitably. And that will be one of our focus areas going forward. Though I don\u2019t want to overemphasize that opportunity, we have, as you know, spent a lot of time and a lot of effort to land in the 10 categories that we\u2019ve landed in. And our intention is to grow and to win and to seize opportunities and to do it profitably in each of them. But clearly, we see those same opportunities in the over-the-counter medicines business. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Steve Powers : Jon, you\u2019ve had a couple of tremendous growth quarters in the U.S. as well as China the past six months, and you\u2019ve hinted at it a little bit this morning already. But, I was just hoping you could talk a little bit more explicitly around your expectations for those markets over the remainder of the year, both in terms of consumer takeaway as well as your own selling patterns, if they\u2019re likely to differ. And I guess I don\u2019t know if you consider this a separate question, but I guess, I\u2019m curious as to what you attribute that outstanding growth to in those markets versus what I think equates to more like low to mid single digit growth across the rest of the portfolio. And I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s just a focus of -- it\u2019s just a function of your particular focus or if there are underlying differences that are more structural in those most focused of your focused markets, versus the rest of world as we think about the go forward. Jon Moeller : We\u2019ve talked for some time. David began talking about this at CAGNY several years ago, about the importance of winning in the U.S. and China. And we\u2019ve been very intentional in establishing superior positions across our categories in those two markets. Even our organization design is structured to allow our -- the leadership of our Company to focus their time and effort on the focus markets with, as you say, China and U.S. being the most focused of the focused markets. And the combination of that organization choice, that prioritization choice and the execution of holistic strategy are what are making the difference in the U.S. and in China. The U.S. and China, from a category growth standpoint do have category growth rates that are higher on average than some other parts of the world. I take Europe as an example; currently, Southeast Asia, Middle East and Africa, as an example. But, I don\u2019t think that that is -- I mean, there is significant opportunity across the geographic portfolio, witnessed in the quarter we just completed, we grew organic sales and we grew earnings in every geographic segment. So, as we fully and holistically execute the strategy on a global basis, there should be opportunity to improve growth rates in the non-U.S. and non-China business. And we\u2019re going to have to work really hard to maintain strong growth rates in the U.S. and China, where we have very strong and able competition. The growth rates that we delivered most recently are very strong, very attractive. They were pre-COVID. They were certainly in the U.S. during covert, not so much in China. And the rebound in China has been encouraging to see. But, I think, from a sustainable standpoint, and we talked about this at Lauren\u2019s conference in the fall, earlier in the fall, you need to really start with what you expect market growth to be and assume we can build a couple of share points or a little bit of share on top of that to really ground yourself on what\u2019s reasonable to deliver over longer periods of time. Now, as I said earlier in this conversation, we have a responsibility to impact that market growth, and we believe we\u2019ve done that certainly in the U.S., and we need to continue doing that. Very long-winded question, but the disproportionate growth in the U.S. and China is partly a function of those markets. It\u2019s partly a function of priority. It\u2019s partly a function of the execution of the strategy, and I think it has -- it\u2019s already had application elsewhere and will continue to even more so, as we move forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : Hey. Good morning, Jon. And congrats again on another great quarter. First, a housekeeping question. I apologize if I missed this. Do you have a global retail takeaway number relative to the 9% organic sales growth in the quarter? That would be helpful. So, my broader question, Jon, is on the U.S. men\u2019s grooming category. I was hoping to get an update there. And I ask, of course, in the context some of the challenges, some of the demand challenges that that business has faced for a while, which has been compounded a bit by the pandemic and work-from-home trends. And now, I also think it\u2019s notable that the Dollar Shave is rolling out at Walmart just this week. It probably suggests further risk to shave may slow some of this [ph] momentum. But, can you comment a bit on the potential risk to Gillette\u2019s market share position, spending plans that are in place? We talked about promotion early. I suspect this will likely be a category or a destination for some of their higher promotion, particularly in the competitive environment and some of the demand challenges. And maybe just comment on your level of comfort around pricing ladders and price positions in the category, which I know has been an area of emphasis here in recent years. Jon Moeller : I\u2019m going to suggest you get with John Chevalier after the call. He can give you a more specific number on retail offtake during the quarter. Going at it kind of from the top of my head, I would guess it\u2019s probably 7 or 8, but John can help you with that. In terms of Grooming, Grooming continues to be a very attractive business. We grew the top-line on our Grooming business globally two years ago. We grew it last year, so two years in a row of growth. And we grew at 6% in the quarter that we just completed. Part of that -- part of the pickup in the business is a result of a more holistically serving all consumers. So, we\u2019ve talked about SkinGuard as an example that was designed to meet the needs of a high percentage of men who had sensitive skin, for whom shaving was painful, and reduced that barrier to shave frequency and shaving in general. We launched now in some channels and in some parts of the world, a whole lineup of products under the brand of King C. Gillette that are designed to serve men who choose to maintain facial hair, so everything from trimmers to beard wax to conditioners, et cetera, and that has been going very, very well. And the third thing I would point to is very strong innovation on our dry shave business, which grew -- has been growing very attractively as well. This will continue to be a competitive category because of the attractiveness of the category. You should assume that that is built into our thinking and built into our plans. And I want to avoid any specific reference to pricing or promotion in a specific category of business. But, we are -- we like this business. It\u2019s growing. It\u2019s very profitable, highly cash-generative, and it\u2019s something we\u2019ll be investing behind. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JP Morgan. Andrea Teixeira : Congrats on your results. Jon, if you could break down your 7% volume growth in additional distribution and innovation against just a lot you have of the legacy franchises, just to get an idea of the duration of this momentum. And conversely, perhaps the only area that you may need to improve are the mid-tier diapers. So, can you give us your view on this segment globally? Jon Moeller : I really don\u2019t know how to break volume down with any confidence along the lines that you\u2019re requesting. So, I apologize for that. We have some great positions in diapers around the world, particularly in the pant style form, where we\u2019re market leaders, and that is the fastest-growing segment of the diaper market on a global basis. We\u2019re also doing very well in the premium portion of the business. As you rightly point out, we have not been superior in the middle of the market, what we call mainline. And we have, as you would expect, been working hard on that and have innovation coming to market across the world, beginning this quarter and next, and carrying on through 2021, which we expect to address that situation. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark Astrachan : Jon, I wanted to go back to e-commerce, so 11%, 12% of sales. I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s somewhere kind of doubled where it was pre-COVID. So, maybe touch on how much of that increase is sustainable? I mean, how much of those consumers are going to continue to purchase in that medium? And what drives the adoption of those consumers to maintain that presence on a go-forward basis? And the things that you\u2019ve seen, maybe all have on our own working kind of see that that will continue and curious how you all are thinking about it? And sort of related to that and under any circumstances, would you pursue more DTC, things like SK-II even broadly? I think that would be helpful. Thanks. Jon Moeller : We want to serve consumers in a superior fashion wherever they choose to shop. And that\u2019s really our focus. So, we\u2019re not focused on one channel versus another. We prefer to be channel-agnostic and let the consumer make that choice. And as long as we\u2019re very well-positioned with a superior product, a superior package that\u2019s relevant for the channel, communication that\u2019s relevant to the channel and have the right value, if they choose to shop in e-commerce, we\u2019ll win. If they choose to shop in brick-and-mortar, we\u2019ll win. If they choose a hybrid shopping experience like click and collect, if we\u2019re appropriately positioned, we should do very well. So, that\u2019s our focus vis-\u00e0-vis any specific channel focus. Within that, DTC clearly can play a role. As you mentioned, in some of our businesses, it\u2019s already a significant part of the operating model. It\u2019s -- it allows us to get closer to consumers to understand, to have an even better understanding of their needs and their habits, including their purchase habits, and that all can be very complementary and important in the broader context. So, you will see us continue to increase our DTC presence, but again, not at the preference of -- or the de-prioritization of any other channel of trade. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Olivia Tong : I want to talk broadly about the competitive dynamics, because clearly, we\u2019re innovating, gaining share. Your plans from earlier this year to double down on investment is working. So, what\u2019s your view on competition at this point? Because, they\u2019ve also talked about picking up the pace in their activity, have you seen it? And it\u2019s perhaps just not quite landing how they had anticipated, or is there more to come from competition that\u2019s factored into the full year sales expectations? And maybe where you\u2019re most concerned, because you talked about still catching up to demand in a couple of categories, Family Care, Home Care, some Health Care and newer growth in the non-COVID categories, like Beauty, Grooming, and Health Care has really started to accelerate. So, I would love a little bit more color on that. Thank you. Jon Moeller : I\u2019m going to start where you ended, Olivia, and then I\u2019ll come back to competition. The strong quarters that we\u2019ve been putting together are a reflection of our brand portfolio and our strategies, which built momentum for the business prior to COVID, have maintained momentum through COVID and allowed us to accelerate in the quarter that we just completed. These are a set of strategies in an activity system that were well suited to the pre-COVID environment, as we saw reflected in our results; are very well suited to the COVID environment, as you see reflected in our results; and we expect will be very well suited to someday a post-COVID environment. And that set of strategies and importantly the execution behind them on the part of 99,000 P&G men and women around the world is what\u2019s driving, as you rightly point to, growth on the top-line and the bottom line across each of our franchises. We talked about the challenge we still have in Baby Care and how we\u2019re going to address that. But 9 out of 10 categories grew top-line in the quarter. Each of our geographic regions grew top-line in the quarter, and that\u2019s really reflective of the execution of this integrated set of strategies that we\u2019ve been working on for some time. We feel that is the best insulation against what is certainly a competitive marketplace across the board. I want to be careful though that we don\u2019t react necessarily to competitive statements about spending as inherently inducing risk. Competitive spending that\u2019s constructively structured and that grows -- increases consumer awareness and participation in categories is not a bad thing. So, what\u2019s more important is the how or the what. And we\u2019re early in the execution of some of those competitive agendas, and we\u2019ll see. But, I know for sure that our best chance of continuing our momentum and doing it profitably is to continue to execute the strategy that\u2019s been working for us so well. Operator : We\u2019ll next go to Wendy Nicholson with Citi. Wendy Nicholson : Could you talk about your margins? Both, growth and operating have just exploded, and that\u2019s awesome. But, I\u2019m wondering how much of that is structural improvement you\u2019ve made to your organizational structure and all that kind of stuff, and how much of it is just the benefit of favorable operating leverage. So as we think longer term, two years, three years, four years out, have you permanently reset the margin structure for the Company, or do we think those are going to trickle back when top-line growth normalizes a bit? Thanks. Jon Moeller : So, within the 300 basis points of operating margin improvement, about two-thirds is attributable to sales leverage, which still leaves a healthy third, around 100 basis points. That\u2019s due to the net of savings and productivity and our reinvestment in superiority. So, that\u2019s the breakdown that you\u2019ve asked for. We are very clear in our own minds that on a going basis, we need to grow the top-line and we need to grow margin. So, everything we\u2019re executing is designed to do both, both now and moving forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Nik Modi : Jon, I was wondering if you could just pick up on your thoughts on the economy. And I ask this really because obviously there is a concern that if you do kind of hit them tougher times that there will be a lot of trade down pressure, not just for Procter but for a lot of CPG companies that tend to play into more premium end of the categories. But, I was just wondering what you thought about this whole thesis of income\u2019s bifurcating [ph] or the consumer goods bifurcating because the lower income demographic is getting much more impact due to furloughs and job losses at the kind of lower end of the range spectrum, yet, middle income and higher income consumers are still doing fairly well. So, I was just hoping you could just add some thoughts to that whole thought process. Jon Moeller : Thanks, Nik. I\u2019m not smart enough to know where this all lands. What I can do is look at the data that are available to date. And that\u2019s a fairly encouraging set of data. If we look at private label shares as a proxy for trade down, U.S. private label shares in the last three-month period are down 1 full point, which is an acceleration in the decline versus the prior three-month period, and the same dynamic generally holds true in Europe. There is just a heightened need for products that deliver against health, hygiene and clean home concerns and a willingness to spend just a little bit more to ensure that I\u2019m using a product that I know and trust and believe will work for me and for my family. So, in most of our categories, that\u2019s the dynamic that\u2019s playing. Supporting that direction, unlike prior crisis, or very different from prior crisis, is a whole reconfiguration of the consumer budget. They\u2019re not spending money generally on travel, on entertainment, at a meal at a restaurant, on apparel. So, they do have some flexibility. It\u2019s more prevalent now than has been the case historically, which they can redirect and many are redirecting if they choose to do so. Now, I want to be careful here. I\u2019m not suggesting that there isn\u2019t greater economic stress ahead of us or that it won\u2019t have more of an impact than we\u2019ve seen thus far. I just don\u2019t have the ability to predict where that goes or lands. I can only really reflect on what we\u2019ve seen thus far, which is in total, encouraging. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse. Kaumil Gajrawala : Jon, I know this is going to -- it\u2019s a hard question to answer, and we don\u2019t have the specific details. But, we\u2019re getting a lot of questions from investors on how you might be thinking or scenario planning around any changes or really increases in the tax structure, if there\u2019s a change in administration. Jon Moeller : First of all, any meaningful change in the tax structure at the corporate level in all probability requires a change in the executive branch and control of the Senate. So, that\u2019s the first handicapping that anybody has to do in order to understand whether there\u2019s likely to be change. The second point I would make is, there\u2019s a lot of conversation and rhetoric at the surface of this issue. But, if we go back to why did so many of us push so hard for so long on corporate tax reform, and again, I\u2019m dealing with the corporate piece of this, and why was it eventually enacted. There were some very powerful and important motivators that I don\u2019t think have diminished in their importance. The first was we wanted American companies to be fully competitive in non-American markets, which would give American companies every opportunity to attract capital, to grow, to create jobs, to increase America\u2019s standard of living. The second motivation was to prevent capital flight to make it attractive to be domiciled and headquartered here in America as opposed to moving operations to other parts of the world. And the third, which is closely related to the second, is we wanted to incent capital formation onshore versus offshore. Those are very strong motivators and very important dynamics that I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s going to casually walk past. So, I just offer that in terms of the amount of thought, deliberation and consideration that I expect will go into any recommended change that to date collectively hasn\u2019t been applied most recently to this question. So, I\u2019m stopping shorter than a specific answer on the numerics. It\u2019s going to be highly dependent on the details of what if anything happens. And that answer is going to be driven by, I think, a lot more reflection on the three questions that I just mentioned as well as some others. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with Truist Securities. Bill Chappell : Hey. Two quick ones. One, Jon, just remind us how big dry shave is of total shave. Just I was a little surprised that it could offset the whole business, I mean, even with 30% growth. And then, on the commodity front, can you maybe talk a little bit about what\u2019s changed and what you see on the horizon just since you gave guidance I guess, two and a half months ago to have a little more of a headwind. Jon Moeller : I understand the question on the breakdown of dry versus wet shave. I don\u2019t have the data. But, if you call John, he can certainly get that for you. The commodity environment, in my way of thinking, hasn\u2019t changed dramatically since we provided guidance for the year. There\u2019s been an increase in pulp, as an example, an increase in some of the other items we purchased. But, overall, it\u2019s a relatively, on a historical basis, benign environment at the moment. Oil and the petro complex is generally somewhat range-bound. I\u2019ll leave it there. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Jon Andersen with William Blair. Jon Andersen : I have two quick questions on mix, first one being, if you could describe the impact of mix on the P&L, whereby it adds to sales, organic sales growth that detracts from gross margin in the quarter. And the second question is the mix benefit you experienced in the quarter and the top line looks to be driven essentially by fabric and Home Care and to a lesser extent Health Care; the balance of the division is neutral. What\u2019s happening within those segments that\u2019s driving favorable mix? Thank you. Jon Moeller : Mix is a very complicated animal because there is not just category mix, but there is geographic mix. And so, for example, when the U.S. grows faster than almost any other market, both with its sales rate or revenue per case and its profitability, that has a significant impact as do the category differences that you referenced. To get to the conundrum of gross margin going one way as it relates to mix and P&L going another way, I\u2019ve talked about this quite a bit. And it\u2019s a reason that I really don\u2019t -- I\u2019m not focused on margins. We\u2019re not focused on margins. I don\u2019t want that to scare anybody because I didn\u2019t say we weren\u2019t focused on profit and cash. But, margins are an interesting animal. I can\u2019t put margins in a bank. I can\u2019t return margins to shareowners. I can\u2019t really invest margins in innovation. What I can do, what we can do is invest profit and cash in each of those things. We can put that in the bank. We can redistribute that to shareholders that we can invest it in increasing our margin of superiority. We have -- many of our premium offerings carry a lower gross margin but a higher penny profit. Laundry unit dose is an example of that dynamic. I\u2019ll take that higher penny profit every day of the week, even though it may degrade our gross margin to some degree. But, that\u2019s the dynamic, the delta between a margin and penny profit that\u2019s driving the math that you\u2019re seeing. And that\u2019s why we can\u2019t get hung up in margins per se. But, we should be very hung up on profit and cash. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day. Jon Moeller : Just one bit of summary for those of you who are still on the line. Again, as we reflect on this quarter, the point that I think is most important to take away is the momentum of the business and the robustness of the strategy and the brand portfolio that are driving that momentum, pre-COVID, during COVID, now, post-COVID. And I\u2019m happy to talk at greater length about that with any of you as the day and the week progresses. But, that is the takeaway here. And I really appreciate your time and your questions. Have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to Procter & Gamble\u2019s Quarter-end Conference Call. Today\u2019s event is being recorded for replay. This discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G\u2019s most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the Company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from these projections. As required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the Company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business trends and has posted on its Investor Relations website, www.pginvestor.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Now, I will turn the call over to P&G\u2019s Vice Chairman, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller. Jon Moeller : Good morning. I\u2019d like to start by expressing our sincere hope that you and your families remain safe and are well. Joining me on the call today are Andre Schulten, who will take on Chief Financial Officer responsibilities as of March 1st, and John Chevalier, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. I\u2019m going to continue to have overall responsibility for Investor Relations with John\u2019s able leadership and let Andre into our discussions as we move forward. We\u2019re again going to keep our prepared remarks brief this morning, given strong and straight forward results, focusing most of our time on your questions. The strong momentum we\u2019ve created over the past number of years, top-line, bottom-line and cash continued in the October, December quarter, which will enable us to further increase fiscal year guidance for organic sales growth, core earnings per share growth, cash productivity and our commitment for cash return to shareowners. We\u2019ve built strong momentum leading up to the COVID crisis. In calendar year \u201819, for example, pre-COVID, we grew organic sales 6%, core earnings per share 15%, and delivered 102% adjusted free cash flow productivity. This pre-COVID momentum gave us the confidence to continue providing guidance as many eliminated it, and to increase our dividend at the highest rate of many years in April last year, even as we struggled with new COVID realities. Building on that strong momentum, we accelerated organic top-line growth in calendar year 2020, which we just completed to nearly 8%, overcoming significant challenges, including the lockdown in China, closure of the travel retail, electro, specialty beauty and away-from-home channels, operational challenges, safely staffing our facilities and sourcing materials necessary to maintain and in some categories significantly increase production to serve heightened consumer cleaning, health and hygiene needs, strong momentum before COVID and during COVID reflecting the underlying strength of our brands and the appropriateness of the strategy, which is driving our business. Organic sales up 8% for the quarter, 5 points of volume growth, 1 point of pricing, 2 points of mix, broad-based growth. U.S organic sales up 12%. Past four quarters sequentially for calendar year 2020, plus 10%, plus 19%, plus 16%, now plus 12%. Greater China up 12%. Past four quarters minus 10%, during lockdown plus 14%, plus 12%, now plus 12%. Focus markets up 10%, and enterprise markets, which are significantly impacted by the COVID pandemic up 3%. Each of our 10 product categories grew organic sales. Home Care up around 30%, Oral Care and Family Care up double digits, Fabric Care, up high singles. Personal Health Care, Feminine Care, Hair Care, Skin and Personal Care and Grooming up mid singles and Baby Care up low single digits. E-commerce sales up nearly 50% for the first half. Aggregate market share growth [of] [ph] 20 basis points this quarter. Turning to earnings. Core earnings per share of a $1.64, up 15%, currency-neutral core earnings per share up 18%. Past four quarters, currency-neutral core earnings per share up 15%, up 11%, up 22% and up 18% this past quarter. Second quarter core gross margin expansion of 150 basis points, up 200 basis points excluding currency impacts. Core operating margin grew 250 basis points, up 310 basis points excluding currency. Adjusted free cash flow productivity of 113%. Returning $5 billion of cash to shareowners, $2 billion of dividends paid and $3 billion of stock repurchase. So, halfway through the fiscal year, year-to-date organic sales up 9%, core earnings per share up 17%, ex-currency up 20%. Adjusted free cash flow productivity over 100%. $9 billion of cash return to shareowners, 110% of all-in earnings. As we\u2019ve shared previously, we\u2019ve established three priorities that have been guiding our actions and our choices in this crisis period. First and importantly is ensuring the health and safety of our P&G colleagues around the world. Second, maximizing the availability of products we produce to help people and their families with their cleaning, health and hygiene needs. These products are more important than ever, given the needs created by the current crisis, increased awareness of health and hygiene and additional time that we\u2019re all spending at home. Third priority, supporting the communities, relief agencies and people who are on the frontlines of this global pandemic with product donations, PPE production, financial support and using our marketing and communications expertise to encourage consumers to support public health measures, which slow the spread of the virus. These priorities are completely congruent with our strategic choices, which we remain confident in and are the foundation for balanced top and bottom-line growth and long-term value creation. Our strategies, we focus our portfolio on daily use products in categories where performance plays a significant role and brand choice. In these performance-driven categories, we raise the bar on all aspects of superiority, products, package, brand communication, retail execution, and value. Superior offerings delivered with superior execution drive market growth. Leading category growth with superior offerings mathematically builds market share and builds business for our retail partners. We\u2019ve made investments to strengthen the long-term health and competitiveness of our brands. And we\u2019ll continue to invest to extend our margin of advantage and quality of execution, improving options for consumers around the world. The strategic need for this investment, the short-term needs to manage through this crisis and the ongoing need to drive balanced top and bottom-line growth including margin expansion underscore the importance of ongoing productivity. We\u2019re driving cost savings and cash productivity in all facets of our business, up and down the income statements and across the balance sheet. Success in our highly competitive industry requires agility that comes with a mindset of constructive disruption, a willingness to change, adapt and create new trends and technologies that will shape our industry for the future. In the current environment, that agility and constructive disruption mindset are even more important. Our new organization structure yields a more empowered, agile and accountable organization with little overlap or redundancy flowing to new demands, seamlessly supporting each other to deliver against our priorities around the world. These strategic choices on portfolio, superiority, productivity, constructive disruption and organizational structure and culture are not independent strategies. They reinforce and build on each other. When executed well, they grow markets, which in turn grow share, sales and profit. These strategies were delivering strong results before the crisis, has served us well during these more recent volatile times, and we believe will continue to serve as well post-crisis. I want to talk a little bit about post-crisis dynamics. While we will undoubtedly experience some volatility, as we move to a new reality, and quarterly results will not move in a straight line, we\u2019re optimistic of our post-crisis prospects and generally like our hand. As consumers spend more time at home due to the pandemic, we\u2019ve seen dynamics play out differently across different categories. More time at home benefits our family, fabric and home care businesses. It negatively impacts grooming, SK-II, deodorants, adult incontinence. So, COVID impacts are different, some positive and some negative across categories. Impacts are also different across regions. While North America market growth has increased, the reverse is true in our Asia, Middle East and Africa region as an example. We\u2019ve suffered disruptions across multiple channels, closures across electro, specialty beauty, away-from-home channels, dental offices. In Japan, department stores still lack beauty consultants, which impacts our premium SK-II business. As I mentioned, our P&G professional away-from-home business has been impacted by low hotel and restaurant occupancy. We\u2019ve seen some supply chain benefits from higher throughput as we simplify the number of SKUs. The costs have increased to source materials, maximize safety, and importantly to transport finished goods. So, as and when we\u2019re out of COVID, we expect some of the current tailwinds to our business will dissipate, but some very strong headwinds should also abate or disappear. And then, there are the mid to long-term impacts of the crisis, which may be accelerators of top and bottom-line growth. The relevance of our categories and consumers lives potentially increases. We will serve what will likely become a forever altered cleaning, health and hygiene focus for consumers who use our products daily or multiple times each day. There may be a continued increased focus on home, more time at home, more meals at home with related consumption impacts. The importance of noticeably superior performance, potentially gross, there\u2019s potential for increased preference for established reputable brands that solve newly framed problems better than alternatives, potentially less experimentation, potential for a lasting shift to e-commerce, both etailers and omni-channel. Our experience to-date makes us believe we are generally well-positioned in this environment. We\u2019re discovering lower cost ways of working with fewer resources. Today\u2019s necessity giving rise to the productivity inventions of tomorrow. New digital tools are being brought to the forefront, providing another productivity driver on the factory floor, in our labs and the office environment. We very much like our long-term prospects, though the near-term will continue to be challenging and more difficult to predict. Our near-term outlook begins with an assumption of how underlying consumer markets will develop. This by itself is highly uncertain. While the first rounds of vaccines have been deployed, the number of COVID cases remain high in many parts of the world, without the resources or infrastructure to effectively manage it. Despite the launch of vaccines, we'll likely be operating through fiscal '21 much as we have been for the past nine months. In the U.S. and other markets, it's unclear how long we'll be operating at high unemployment levels and how much mitigating economic stimulus will actually be available. There continues to be social unrest and economic distress in many parts of the world that also affect the prospects for category growth. These same dynamics can result in an increased cost to operate. There is a risk of supply chain disruption of our operations or those of our suppliers. Channel disruptions will likely continue. Against this challenging backdrop, we're holding ourselves to an expectation of continued growth, top-line and bottom-line and expect to be highly cash generative. With the strong first half of the base, we're further increasing our fiscal year guidance for organic sales growth, core earnings per share growth, adjusted free cash flow productivity and cash return to shareowners. We're raising our organic sales growth guidance from a range of 2% to 4% going into the fiscal year, to a range of 4% to 5% after the first quarter, now to a range of 5% to 6%. The outlook assumes a quarter-to-quarter step-down in the second half as retail inventories are fully replenished and as category consumption levels moderate. We saw a sequential deceleration in U.S. consumption in our categories in December and January. These trends are incorporated into our new higher guidance range. We're increasing core earnings per share growth guidance from a range of 3% to 7%, the previously 5% to 8%, now to 8% to 10%, a 2.5 point increase at the midpoint of the range. This bottom-line outlook includes headwinds of approximately $100 million after tax of foreign exchange, $150 million from the combination of higher interest expense and lower interest income and $100 million after tax of higher freight costs. Commodities are currently forecast to be neutral to earnings on the year. We will continue our long track record of significant cash generation and cash return to shareowners. We're raising our target for adjusted free cash flow productivity from 90% going into the year to about 95% after Q1, now to a range of 95% to 100%. We continue to expect to pay approximately $8 billion in dividends and are further increasing our outlook on share repurchase from a range of $7 billion to $9 billion to up to $10 billion. Combined, a plan to return around $18 billion of cash to shareowners this fiscal year, over 125% of all-in earnings. This outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Significant currency weakness, commodity cost increases, additional geopolitical disruptions, major production stoppages or additional store closures are not anticipated within the guidance range. Wrapping up, we created strong momentum well before the COVID crisis. We've strengthened our position further during the crisis, and we believe P&G is well-positioned to serve the heightened needs and new behaviors of consumers and our retail and distributor partners post crisis. We will manage what could be a volatile short to midterm, consistent with the strategy we've outlined many times, and against the immediate priorities of ensuring employee health and safety, maximizing availability of our products to serve cleaning, health and hygiene needs, and helping society overcome the challenges of this crisis. We're stepping forward, not back. We're doubling down to serve consumers and our communities. We're doing this in our interest, in society's interest and in the interest of our long-term shareholders. We're happy now to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks. Good morning. Jon, I wanted to talk a little bit actually about your reference to cleaning, health and hygiene, and long-term category growth. So, first was just closer, and I was curious if you had a view on household pantry inventory, knowing that in some regions there's been still shortages, limited ability to purchase, and this is particularly U.S. conversation. In other markets, you go into a retailer and there is product on shelf and that's obviously gotten better to the pandemic. So, I was curious to get a sense of how much there is in terms of consumer pantry inventory right now of cleaning, particularly surface cleaning product was one? And then, two, just thinking longer term to your reference to change, heightened consumer interest. I mean, how do you think a company like P&G can best address that? Is it occasions? Is it chemistry? Is it packaging? What are sort of the things you're thinking about as you prepare for that future and the ability to kind of capitalize on this heightened consumer interest that you've referred to going forward? Thanks. Jon Moeller : Thanks, Lauren. We obviously don't have perfect insights into pantry inventories. We know that they're higher, as you indicated, primarily in the U.S. And as you rightly pointed out in many parts of the world, there aren't homes that are large enough to accommodate significant pantry inventory build and there are no pantries. We're also seeing though very, very importantly, increased consumption in these categories, more time at home, more meals at home, higher consumption. In the U.S., as an example, cleaning and sanitizing frequency is up 30%, dishwashing frequency is up 15%, air freshening frequency up 20%; in-home paper towel usage, up 15%. So, while there has been an understandable tendency for some consumers, particularly in the U.S. to build inventory to protect themselves and their family and to minimize trips outside their home, consumption is generally following. Could there be some reduction in top-line growth rates if God-willing the situation gets better, and therefore, I need less in my pantry as protection? Yes, that could occur for some period of time but not in the mid to long term obviously. And those increased levels of consumption are accompanied in many cases by new habit formation or habit strengthening. And unfortunately, we've not been at this for 4 weeks or 8 weeks where things might -- where behavior might snap back to pre-crisis levels. We've been at this on a global basis, even in the U.S. for a year. And that does tend to form habits, which means some higher level of consumption should continue to occur post crisis. And then, while I'm on it, while it's not part of your question, remember again, from our prepared remarks that there are many categories that have suffered as a result of the dynamics we're all managing through. And those should provide an offset in a more normalized environment, the same with markets, the same with channel opening. Heightened consumer interest in health, hygiene and the clean home, what are we doing? The way I like to think about this is how can we step up and step forward to better serve consumers with these heightened needs. Some of that -- and it's all the things that you mentioned. We are innovating and bringing new products to market to better meet those needs, whether that's Microban 24 as an example; whether that's Safeguard sanitizer; whether that is for better oral health as an example, the new IO offering, which has driven a 20% year-to-year increase in our power brush sales. We're modifying packaging, so that it's clearer relative to the health hygiene, clean home benefits that our products offer. We're educating, both to your point on usage occasions and helpful tips around the home. One of our categories that's done a particularly good job on that is our home care category, which has shifted a fair amount of advertising to an educational format, which is designed again to serve consumers during this difficult period. And, our broad brand communication and messaging is generally reflective of those kinds of opportunities. Claims support, developing claims are essentially communication that we can back up with laboratory research that highlights the benefit of our products in many categories to serve these needs. For example, hygiene, that's a benefit as a result of use of some of our laundry offerings. The long answer, but it was a good question. And I want to just reiterate the point again that the question behind the question in all of this I suspect today will be are you -- what kind of shape are you going to come out of this in? And I think, we think we're going to be in great shape coming out of this. I won't predict a top-line growth rate or a bottom-line growth rate that accompanies that, but from a strategy standpoint, from a brand portfolio standpoint, from an organization execution standpoint, and as I mentioned, from the variety of impacts that COVID has had across the portfolio, both categories and geographies and channels, we feel very well-positioned to continue the momentum that we've developed. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Steve Powers : Great. Thanks. Good morning, Jon. Congrats on the new role, Andre. Jon, you mentioned the valuation-related pricing a few times in the release today. And I guess, I'm curious if there is a way to quantify the impact of that relative to what, I guess, might be considered underlying price movements in the quarter. As we think about calendar '21 and the setup as we go forward with FX set at the moment to reverse and likely the lapping of some of the COVID promotional pullbacks in 2020, I guess how are you sizing up the prospects of additional net reported price realization as we go forward? Investors are clearly focused on inflationary cost pressures that are building. And I guess the real question is I'm curious as to whether you think those incremental pressures can be offset by cost-justified pricing in the year ahead, or will competition and a return to more normalized promotional patterns make that difficult? Thank you. Jon Moeller : Thanks, Steve. As you rightly point out, there are a lot of moving pieces within that top-line. From a -- when you put it all together though, price contributed 1 point to the 8 points of top-line growth in the quarter. So, to the extent that everything that's happening, complex as it may be, reverses itself. That has about a 1 point impact on top line growth. Promotion levels, which you've mentioned, have returned from about the lowest point, which was about 17% of products sold on promotion, up to about 26%. So, a significant amount of that promotion return is already in the numbers. And that compares to a pre-crisis range of, call it, averagely 33%. I don't know necessarily where post crisis we're going to net out on that percent, but that gives you that math. The other thing I would point out is that some modest pricing is inherent in our innovation-based and superiority-based business model. Superiority not in terms of price points, but superiority in terms of performance. And if you look at the 1 point sales impact in the quarter we just completed, that's pretty normal. So, we look at -- if you look at the 41 out of the last 45 quarters, pricing has been neutral to a slight positive impact on the top-line, 15 out of the last 16 years. So, if we're going to define an expectation of the future based on normalization, it doesn't look a lot different than what you're seeing now. The drivers may vary and be different by category, by market. But, I think what you're seeing is generally representative of our history and to some extent, representative of the future. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Olivia Tong : Jon, you talked last quarter a lot about potential for upside to the range but also downside. And your commentary so far seems to suggest a lot of continuation of the current trends in terms of usage patterns, pricing can continue to be positive. So, when you marry that with the implied second half outlook range, can you just talk through that a little bit? Because it sounds like you're expecting the same dynamic. But, is there any shift in terms of the relative upside-downside to your outlook at this point? Because you do sound pretty optimistic about the post-COVID period. Thanks. Jon Moeller : The two -- potentially two different questions within there, Olivia. One is the back half; the second is the post-COVID period, which we don't assume occurs in our back half. Let me cover the second one first and then come closer into the back half. When I'm talking about being well-positioned for a post-COVID environment, I'm talking about the mid to long term. I'm talking about the strength of our brands, our strategies and our organization, coupled with what versus pre-COVID will likely be some increase in health, hygiene and clean home consumption of a consumer base that's been through a very difficult and frankly for many of us, life-altering period of time. As we come back in and look at the back half, as I said, we are not assuming the situation changes. And in fact, I've mentioned that I suspect we'll be operating very much as we have for the balance of -- at least the balance of the fiscal year. And I would view the upsides and the downsides in the back half is relatively symmetric. I would view them similar to how I viewed them, how we viewed them when we last spoke. So, that hasn't changed. What's changed is two very strong quarters now in the books, which on a fiscal year basis certainly removes some of that risk and as reflected in our guidance in presses. But, there are just so many things going on in all of our lives and in the world around us, but to assume linearity of any degree is difficult. Think about simple things like rents, like repayment of student loans, like employment, those issues were somewhat offset by stimulus and regulation, for example, in the U.S. in the first half, and it's still unclear exactly what's going to happen to many of those items in the second half. We obviously start getting to higher base periods as we get into the back half as well. And some amount of promotion will move closer off that 26%, closer to something like 30% over some period of time. We'll have to see how that plays out. So again, I think that all the steps we've taken to build momentum in our business pre-COVID have served us very well during COVID, they will continue to serve us well in the back half, and they set us up well for the long term. But, there's a ton of volatility between here and there. Now one way for me to frame that is just think as we were having this conversation last year at this time, and we were trying to prognosticate about what the next six months or the next year would look like. None of us would have had any idea. And if anything, the level of certainty has been -- is less today than it was then. But within that, there are opportunities as well as risks. Sorry for the long-winded answer. I hope that helped a little bit. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : Hey, Jon. Congrats, Andre. So, I just wanted to follow up on Steve's question. You highlighted your historical ability to take pricing. But I'd argue the commodity spike looks fairly pronounced here, both in terms of magnitude as we saw with your rates for your guidance on freight and commodities. But also, the higher prices appear more sustainable this time around with the post-COVID economic rebound. So, I just wanted to understand your mindset or sort of willingness to take pricing, either maybe shortening the lead time to take pricing or just in terms of level of magnitude relative to the past because it does seem like it's probably a little more of an atypical situation on the commodity front. And then just second, on the other side of it, what's your sense for retailer enthusiasm in the U.S. for pricing in this environment? Obviously, companies like yourselves have posted significant gross margin expansion over the last couple of years, and there is an uncertain consumer outlook. So, do you really need to see that pressure materialize in gross margins before you discuss pricing with retailers? Can you be more proactive? And again, I'm just trying to understand sort of the mindset here around the past when you've typically been able to take price increases and if anything is potentially different this time around. Jon Moeller : The situation, Dara, is different by category, by market. So, to generalize is difficult, and I apologize for that. But what I would tell you is in general, when your strategy is based on innovation and superiority in categories where superiority drives brand choice, you have more ability to pass on modest cost increases while improving consumer perception of value because they're delivering more performance at the same time. So, at the end of the day, we get ourselves in trouble a little bit when we look at pricing in isolation because that's not how the world works and that's not how the consumer works. That's not how our retail customers think about things either. So, a conversation with a retail customer would involve a whole host of topics with the fundamental question being, do we have a plan together that grows the retailers business and does so in a profitable way. Very rarely do we dissect the conversation to focus on a single variable. That really isn't in either of our interest. Having said all that, is there anything fundamentally different that should -- that I know today that changes materially our ability to deliver the kind of top-line and bottom-line that we have in the past? No. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Congrats again on a strong quarter. Andre, congrats to you as well. I'll pivot away from the topic that you\u2019ll hear on commodities and pricing, Jon, give you a break on that. Longer term question on your online business, which continues to do exceedingly well, now north of 10% of sales. And there seemed to be a false narrative out there probably a year or two ago that the shift to this channel was unfavorable for big brands, which we just really haven't seen, at least broadly in staple. So, as online moves to closer to 20% sales, which would be likely without stretching much in an intermediate term, if you will, using reasonable assumptions, what do you think this will mean for Company sales with respect to market share, margins and returns? And then maybe just comment broadly on risk of private label in this channel. Thanks. Jon Moeller : Thanks, Kevin. So, as we mentioned earlier and as you referenced, we did have another strong quarter. We've had a strong year-to-date outcome within e-commerce growing 50%, now above 14% of the business globally. So, you're right, it's not far from closing in on that 20% level, particularly with those kind of growth rates. Without going through all the details, you know that I've always viewed this channel and the development of this channel as being big established and preferred brand friendly, not an adverse situation but a conducive situation for growth. We need to perform in this channel against all the vectors of superiority just as we do in the others. But, when we do that, there\u2019s no reason to expect that the outcome isn't as or more attractive than it is in some of the traditional retail channels. If you look at your question about market share and margin, on an aggregate basis today, different by category by country, but on an aggregate basis, our market share in e-commerce broadly defined, so pure-play and omni is slightly higher, not by much than our brick-and-mortar market shares. And I think that's more reflective of the demographics of the online shopper than it is anything else. Our margins are also, on aggregate, similar across the two channels. So, we were in a very nice place that we aim to be in, which is we want to be channel-agnostic, serve shoppers wherever they choose to shop and be able to do that, as you rightly point out, in a way that's neutral to accretive to share margin and return. I think we're very well-positioned, requires work every day, very volatile space. We keep our eye on the consumer and serving them with superior offerings. Again, in categories where performance drives brand choice, we should continue to do well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Hey. Good morning, folks. Thank you for sliding me in and congrats on a very strong quarter and most important, solid execution. I do want to come back to the topic I guess -- and that's pricing and commodity. I think we talked a lot about the pricing outlook, but not a lot about the commodity outlook. Jon, I think your back half guidance implies relatively modest inflation, including freight, because you have 1.5% of COGS back of the envelope, not that substantial. So,, is that a factor of just early on the hedges to contracts haven't hold off, and when they deal, it's going to step up significantly, or is there -- or is the management inflation that we're all talking about somewhat sensationalized? Jon Moeller : Thanks, Jason. As we said in our prepared remarks, on a total fiscal year basis, the commodity impact to the bottom line is neutral. So, it not one of the things that I'm actually spending a lot of time on and overly focused on relative to some other things. There has been a recent increase in some of our exposures. But, even if you look at -- if you were to take spot rates versus a year ago and annualize that as one evaluation of what the impact could be, it's modest compared to some of the significant commodity spikes that we've been through the last decade. It's also currently offset to a degree by FX. The other thing is that within the total cost pool, there are significant increases reflected in the current results and in the current margin growth for operating in the environment that we've been operating in. And if vaccinations occur broadly and we return more to normality and economies accelerate and therefore put pressure on commodity markets, I would expect that some of these other costs that we've been incurring would abate. So, much like the COVID impact on categories or markets, there are offsets that we have to consider when we look at commodities. And we need to look at the total picture as we think about pricing going forward, which we will do. But again, I mean, we could be having a very different conversation a quarter from now, but at this point, not a huge concern. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citi. Wendy Nicholson : Can we shift gears and talk about the enterprise markets a little bit? Because I know you walked through some of the things that have challenged your business in those markets over the last nine months. But, I wasn't totally clear on whether a lot of those pressures are pressures to the category or pressures to your market shares. So, if you can kind of say -- update us on where you think you're competitively positioned in those markets. And Jon, I presume you're going to be spending more time focused on those markets now with your new role, kind of what's your outlook? I know historically, it's been about 20% of sales that region or that lump of regions. I'm sure it's going to be smaller this year given the headwinds you've seen in those markets. But kind of what's your longer-term approach to running that business as you get more focused in on them, that kind of stuff. Thanks so much. Jon Moeller : Thanks, Wendy. Stepping back, our strategic objective in establishing a different approach for enterprises markets was twofold. The first and primary objective was to enable leadership and the broad resources of the Company to focus on the largest markets and most profitable markets of the Company, what we call, not surprisingly, focused markets. And our progress there has accelerated pretty dramatically. And if that's all we accomplished, that would be a major step forward. So, I just mentioned the U.S. and China both growing 12% in the quarter, both growing double digits year-to-date. I in no way want to assert causality. That would be careless. But, there's certainly nothing to indicate that increased focus in those markets has hurt us. It certainly appears to have helped us. So, that was objective one. Objective two was to ensure -- was ideally for these markets to continue to be a source of top-line growth and a more dependable source of bottom-line growth for the Company by moving management of activity closer to the market, closer to consumers actually in the market with consumers, competitors and customers. And that generally has played out well as well. So, we grew -- the enterprise markets grew top-line; they grew bottom-line last fiscal year. We got to a point at the end of the year where we had two countries within 100 enterprise markets that we're losing money, which is a huge step forward from where we've been historically. And importantly, we did that while holding or building market share. So, this wasn't a cost, if you will, to top-line growth and development relative to the market. In an ideal world, to answer your question about the future, we would continue to enable a strong emphasis of resources on focus markets and manage the enterprise markets in a way that are accretive to Company top-line, accretive to Company bottom-line. And I think in a normalized, post-COVID environment, that's possible. But, we're being very selective in where we choose to win and how we choose to do that. And again, we want to be a source of support for the major markets in the Company, both from the standpoint of enabling focus and from a standpoint of creating financial resource to do that while maintaining an option on the growth that these markets represent in the future. I'd be happy to spend more time. It's obviously a pretty full topic. But in general, we're progressing along the lines that we've set out to do. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC. Nik Modi : Jon, I thought the context around consumer behavior was very helpful, but I was hoping you can comment on retailer behavior. We've been hearing just generally across the supply chain that retailers are really starting to take seriously assortment -- rationalizing assortment becoming a little bit cleaner in terms of what is on the shelf and how it's displayed. And I would suspect P&G would be in a prime position to benefit from that. So, can you just provide context on kind of what you're seeing and what we should expect as this year unwinds? And I would like to get perspective on the U.S. and maybe some of the international markets to the degree you have that visibility. Jon Moeller : Our relative position with our retail partners continues to strengthen. COVID has exposed some of, for example, the supply chain weaknesses that exist within the ecosystem that have been supporting those retail partners. In general, we've been a source of dependable supply. There are some clear exceptions where growth has accelerated plus 15%, plus 30%, and we don't build our manufacturing infrastructure for that kind of upside, so. But we're catching up here pretty quickly. But in general, we've been a very dependable source of supply. In general, consumers are shifting to known reputable brands. And obviously, our retail partners are consumer-centric themselves. One of the data that support that conclusion, if you look at private-label data as one example, market shares of private label in our categories are down in the U.S. for any time period you look at in the last 12 months. And we're talking significant -- relatively significant declines of up to a point which on their base is not a small number, and the same general dynamic in Europe. So, retailers are looking to serve the changing needs of their consumers, and we do -- we are well-positioned in that regard. Retailers are looking at their assortment. They're also looking at their inventory levels. And there will be pros and cons within that decision set that occur over time. But again, we're relatively well-positioned. The dynamics obviously differ by market, with some markets that are more challenged even than ours from a COVID standpoint, focused almost exclusively on supply. And again, our supply chain sets us up pretty well to serve those retailers. It's early days. We're still working through as are they, the demand and supply dynamics. But I really think our position has been strengthened as a result of the experience and the response that we've all been working on. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein with Evercore. Rob Ottenstein : Hey. Thank you very much and congratulations on another terrific quarter. So, kind of two related questions, and that is, given your new role that you have and/or shifting of responsibilities, can you talk about what you personally will be more focused on over the next 6 to 12 months, your goals and priorities. And then, perhaps related to that, when we -- kind of looking at the Company, listening to you, looking at the performance seems to be a disconnect between your performance and your outlook and the performance of the stock, which really hasn't done too much over the last 12 months, despite the terrific performance of you and your team. I was wondering if you can perhaps give any sort of sense of where you see the disconnect with investors. And whether over time, it may make sense to be perhaps more aggressive on share buybacks? I know you stepped it up a bit, and it's an impressive. But, based on our analysis, the stock is trading really near 20-year lows versus the market looks extremely cheap to us. You have had problems on the M&A side with Billie. So, maybe in terms of capital allocation long term, more buybacks. Just love to get your thoughts on that issue as well. Jon Moeller : Thanks, Rob. We view our job as focusing on E, earnings delivered in a sustainable holistic way. We view the market's job as focusing on P, and over time, strong E with a strong P, as you know. I'm sorry, I'm being fairly simplistic. In terms of share repurchase and capital return in general, if you go back to the beginning of this fiscal year, our estimated range of share repurchase was $6 billion to $8 billion, and we're now up to $10 billion. So, if you look at the midpoint of the range, 7 to 10, that's almost a 50% increase in our expectation of share repurchase for the current fiscal year. And if you look at the combination of dividend and share repurchase, that's $18 billion, 125% of all-in earnings. We have historically returned more than 100% of all-in earnings in the form of both dividends and share repurchase, I would expect us to continue on that journey. April is the timing in which we would next normally review capital allocation with our Board of Directors, including both dividend and share repurchase. But our belief here, Rob, is very simple. Excess cash is not ours; it's yours or the shareowners and will be, as it has historically been returned to them. In terms of M&A as a part of capital allocation, we've been looking at and executing what have typically been relatively small acquisitions that fill in our portfolio and the categories that we've chosen to compete in, things like Native deodorant, things like This Is L, and then as you know and as you referenced, we looked at Billie within the shave care market. Those things by their size don't, in and of themselves, make much of an impact on our capital allocation choices. So, I don't see any reason today, again this can change tomorrow as well. But as we sit here today, we're pretty committed to the course that we've been on, and I don't see anything that should cause us to run off those tracks. Your question on how I spend my time. So, we're in the middle of transitioning -- Andre and are in the middle of transition, and he'll take over the CFO responsibilities March 1st. I look forward to that, one, because he's incredibly talented, committed and energetic leader; and two, as you rightly point out, that gives me a little bit more capacity to focus on very volatile set of circumstances around the world. I will continue to have Investor Relations responsibility, as I mentioned earlier, from a function standpoint. I'll have responsibility for IT for our global business services, for our sales function, our product supply function, including engineering procurement, manufacturing and distribution. I'll have responsibility -- continue to have responsibility for our market operations around the world. And we'll continue, as you know, to have P&L responsibilities for the 100 or so enterprise markets. So, I've got plenty to do. And I look forward to, as we mentioned, a little bit of additional capacity to focus on each of those items. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JP Morgan. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you, Jon and congrats, Andre. So, my question is on marketing and a follow-up on promotions. So, remember, Jon, you had disclosed back about $15 billion in A&P, advertising and promotion spend on the $67 billion to $68 billion sales base back in fiscal '17. Now it seems you're probably spending a similar amount but in a higher top-line, right around $71 billion, not only obviously because of scale, but also from a digital efficiency perspective. So you think those efficiencies will linger long term? And are you seeing -- on that topic, are you seeing private label passing on potentially the increase in pulp, resin, transportation inflation that would probably lead to a lower gap between you and private label? Jon Moeller : A strong support for our brands as part of our model and will continue to be part of the model going forward. If you look at the quarter we just completed just in the marketing side of the equation, we increased marketing about 7% year-on-year. I think our levels of support as witnessed by both our share of progress and our top-line progress are appropriate. I would not want to dial those back by any means. But, I expect they'll pretty much move in line with sales with some efficiencies potentially available to us. And pricing versus private label, I really can't conjecture about future price developments, either on our part or their part by regulation. So, I'm going to leave that question alone for now. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark Astrachan : I wanted to ask about margins, Jon, the risk of sounding very high level. I guess, you've seen a lot of risk margin expansion partly due to commodity cost relief. There is obviously productivity in there. SG&A expenses at the same time have remained relatively constant, as a percentage sales, in recent years, partly benefiting from productivity but also sales leverage. I guess, as you kind of think about longer term, I mean, I guess there's lots of puts and takes. But how do you think about your view of sustaining kind of both where they are today and what would be the biggest puts and takes that we should be thinking about in trying to model those going forward and thinking longer term not obviously quarter-to-quarter here? Jon Moeller : To the extent that we can maintain a reasonable level of top-line growth, we should continue to be able to maintain a reasonable level of margin growth. So, those two are related. I mentioned in our prepared remarks, it's kind of the third leg of the strategy, which is productivity and continues to be a very strategic and important endeavor, which contributes to margin, focused on superiority and performance-driven categories facilitates at times margin growth. I mentioned our efforts to improve the profitability within enterprise markets. That has legs to it. So, there is a chart that I share with our leadership team in almost every meeting, which highlights the importance in terms of delivering total shareholder return in the top -- the peer group of both top line growth and margin and illustrates how it's difficult to get home without both. That will continue to be our mindset. The drivers will be different depending on the time period. We are not talking about huge increases in margin. We're talking about modest increases in margin that are correlated with our ability to grow the top line. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse. Kaumil Gajrawala : So, as you drill down on two segments, I mean, first on Grooming, trends are of course quite strong. But, it looks like the volumes really are starting to take off in a meaningful way. Can you maybe discuss the degree to which that shifts how you're thinking about the growth of the returns in this business model that means for a long time on this kind of reason to believe it and still is -- I know this is -- something's emerging in there? And then secondarily, on Oral Care, I think it is two quarters in a row now you've been up double digits. Obviously Oral Care is one of the segments that kind of disproportionally benefited from folks being at home and such. So, can you maybe just talk about what you're seeing there as categories and just share gains? That's all. Thanks. Jon Moeller : Both categories are benefiting from strong innovation. There's clearly a benefit within the Grooming segment related to more jobs done at home, which is benefit in the appliance side of the business. But overall, the innovation profile in that category and the Oral Care category are what are driving our top line results. I mentioned the introduction of Oral-B iO and the 20% growth in power brush, that's -- we witnessed year-to-date as a result of that introduction, which continues to be very strong. On the Grooming side of the business, whether it's our offerings for sensitive skin, whether it's our new beard care line under the King C. Gillette name, all of those are enabling us to step up, step forward, better serve consumers with all of their needs in that category, and that's reflected in the top-line results that you see. Operator : And your final question comes from the line of Chris Carey with Wells Fargo. Chris Carey : Jon, can you just comment on the -- or expand a bit on the deceleration that you're seeing in your categories that you noted in December and January? I mean the data did suggest that November saw some stock up on another COVID scare. You think December specifically reflects some get back from that stock up, or does this look like a more sustainable step change in trend going forward? And then, maybe I missed it, but which of the regions in which you're seeing this deceleration in the past several months? Jon Moeller : That reference was primarily a U.S. reference, though there's some similar dynamic in Europe. And remember -- so in terms of drivers, you're absolutely right on there being some impact from the November stock up. Also remember that consumer situation has changed measurably from, call it October through to December and then January in terms of the amount of stimulus that was available, the lockdown situations in different parts of the world, the employment situation, all of which can reverse themselves fairly quickly, both from a policy standpoint and hopefully, from a human health standpoint. So, I'm not looking at any of that as a foregone conclusion either for the rest of the year or for the future. But, it's important, particularly when we have a quarter as strong as it is, to be holistic in our explanation of what's happening. So, thanks everybody, thanks for your time on what I know is a very busy day. And John and his team will be available on the balance of the day as well of course I to answer any additional questions that you have. Thanks again. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to Procter & Gamble\u2019s Quarter-End Conference Call. Today\u2019s event is being recorded for replay. This discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G\u2019s most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from these projections. As required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business trends and has posted on its Investor Relations website, www.pginvestor.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Now, I will turn the call over to P&G\u2019s Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer, Jon Moeller. Jon Moeller : Good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Andre Schulten, Chief Financial Officer; and John Chevalier, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Let me quickly summarize another strong quarter and then turn it over to Andre to provide additional perspectives. Organic sales were up 4% on the quarter, up 10% two-year stacked. Global market share was up 40 basis points. Fiscal year-to-date through three quarters, organic sales are up 7%. Core earnings per share up 8% on the quarter, up 14% fiscal year-to-date.Free cash flow productivity over 100%. We are on track to deliver the top and bottom line guidance we have raised twice this fiscal. We are increasing estimates for the third time for free cash flow productivity and cash return to shareowners, which Andre will take us through. One more very important highlight, a 10% dividend increase, which we announced last Tuesday. The team has been managing very successfully with priorities I will describe again later through volatility, uncertainty and some extreme challenges. COVID reopening in some markets increased viral spread, renewed lockdown and severe economic impact in others. Some family is growing at very high rates, others essentially shut; FX and commodity volatility; event specific challenges like the blockage of the Suez Canal; transportation demand mismatched with supply; market-specific dynamics impacting operations in countries like Argentina, Myanmar and Lebanon; and a very mild cough cold season. That\u2019s just a very quick synopsis of strong top line, bottom line and cash results in a very challenging environment with a huge thanks to our team. For more perspective, Andre? Andre Schulten : Thank you, Jon, and good morning, everyone. As Jon said, the March quarter was another period of good top line, bottom line and market share growth, along with strong cash generation and strong cash returns to shareowners. Organic sales were up 4% for the quarter, volume in line with year ago, 2 points of pricing, 2 points of positive mix. Organic sales growth was mixed across regions. Overall focus markets grew 5%, with strong growth in our two largest markets : U.S. organic sales, up 7%; and Greater China sales were up 22%. European focus markets were down 2%, largely due to the impact of lockdowns in the region. Japan was down 5%. Enterprise markets were up 1% and were also mixed within the region. Latin America, up 8%; Asia, Middle East, Africa, in line with year ago quarter; and European enterprise markets were down 4%. We delivered strong organic sales growth in most categories : Home Care, up high-teens; Oral Care, Hair Care and Skin and Personal Care, up high singles; Family Care and Grooming, up mid-singles; Fabric Care, up low singles. Feminine Care organic sales were down low singles, mainly due to market softness in Europe, but share trends remained strong in the region and on a global basis. Baby Care was down mid singles, mainly due to market softness in Europe and heightened competitive activity in China. Importantly, Baby Care all outlet value share in the U.S. is up 130 basis points over the past one month and 80 basis points over the past three months. Personal Health Care organic sales were down mid singles, driven by a very weak cold flu season on top of difficult comparisons in the base period. U.S. sales in the respiratory category were down more than 40% in this March quarter versus last year. Despite the weak category trends, Vicks\u2019 share was up for the quarter. E-commerce sales were up at about 50% fiscal year-to-date with no notes for change in shopping trends in the quarter. E-comm sales represent 14% of our global sales, aggregate market share growth of 40 basis points this quarter. Turning to earnings. Core earnings per share were $1.26, up 8%, currency neutral core EPS also up 8%. Core margin was up 30 basis points, up 80 basis points, excluding currency impacts. Core operating margin was in line with prior year, up 30 basis points, excluding currency impacts. We generated $4.1 billion in operating cash flow with free cash flow productivity at 106%. We returned $5 billion in cash to shareholders, $2 billion in dividends and $3 billion in share repurchase. Last week, we announced a 10% increase in our dividend, reflecting strong results and confidence in our future. This is the 65th consecutive annual dividend increase and 131st consecutive year in which P&G has paid a dividend. So, three quarters into the year, organic sales up 7%, with global value share growing, core EPS, up 14%; ex-FX, up 16%. Adjusted free cash flow productivity over 100%, $14 billion of cash returned to shareowners, which is 120% of all-in earnings. Back to you, Jon. Jon Moeller : As shared in previous discussions, we have established three priorities that have been guiding our actions and our choices in this crisis period. First is ensuring the health and safety of our P&G colleagues around the world; second, maximizing the availability of products we produce to help people and their families with their cleaning, health and hygiene needs. Third priority is supporting the communities, relief agencies and people who are on the frontlines of this global pandemic. These priorities are completely congruent with our strategic choices, which we remain confident in and which are the foundation for balanced top and bottom line growth and long-term value creation. We have focused our portfolio on daily use products in categories where performance plays a significant role in brand choice. In these performance-driven categories, we have raised the bar on all aspects of superiority, product package, brand communication, retail execution and value. Superior offerings delivered with superior execution drive market growth. Leading category market growth with superior offerings mathematically builds market share and builds business for our retail partners. We are continuing to invest in and behind superior offerings. We launched Dawn Powerwash just over a year ago. Its superior formula and unique spray technology provide powerful suds that cut grease on contact. Powerwash has become a welcome addition to consumers\u2019 dish care regimen with so many more meals being cooked at home. Powerwash delivered around $150 million in year one sales and was a significant contributor to Dawn\u2019s U.S. all outlet market share growth of more than 400 basis points over the period. Pampers Baby Dry in the U.S. took another step forward towards regaining superiority across all vectors. Baby Dry recently launched innovation, providing more absorbency, improved comfort and better leakage protection for dry and healthy skin. Product graphics were refreshed with improved leakage protection queues and packaging was upgraded to introduce the claim number one pediatrician recommended and hypoallergenic with no parabens or latex. Innovation includes improved in-store displays and online messaging to highlight the improved product packaging and communication. It\u2019s still very early in the launch as new products and packages just began shipping in the last month and we are now just starting full commercialization. But this initiative represents an important step in reestablishing superiority in the mid-tier on Baby Care. Tide and Ariel are expanding their 2030 brand ambition to focus on decarbonizing laundry at every step, from design, manufacturing and distribution to consumer use and end of life, while maintaining superior cleaning performance. Ariel\u2019s new campaign, Every Degree Makes a Difference, advocates lower washing temperatures, up to 60% of laundry\u2019s carbon footprint comes from heating the water in washing machines. Lowering the wash temperature is the single most important thing we can all do to reduce the environmental impact of laundry. To do this, we continue to innovate to ensure superior performance in cold water. In China Hair Care, two examples of premium innovation launched in the fast growing conditioner and treatment segments. Pantene Quench Shot masks and 3-Minute Miracle has successfully attracted new consumers to the Pantene brand as well as expanded the regimen of current Pantene shampoo consumers. These innovations have contributed to over 35% market growth in these segments online over the past 12 months. Greater China Hair Care organic sales are up mid-teens fiscal year-to-date and were up 25% this quarter led by conditioners and treatments. The strategic need for investment to continue to strengthen the long-term health and competitiveness of our brands, the short-term need to manage through this crisis and the ongoing need to drive balanced top and bottom line growth, including margin expansion, underscores the importance of ongoing productivity. We are driving cost savings and cash productivity in all facets of our business, up and down the income statement and across the balance sheet. Success in our highly competitive industry also requires agility that comes with the mindset of constructive disruption. A willingness to change, adapt and create new trends and technologies that will shape our industry for the future. In the current environment, that agility and constructive disruption mindset are even more important. Our new organization structure yields a more empowered, agile and accountable organization with little overlap or redundancy, following some new demands, seamlessly supporting each other, to deliver against our priorities around the world. These strategic choices on portfolio, superiority, productivity, constructive disruption and organization structure and culture are not independent strategies. They are reinforced and build on each other. We executed well. They grow markets, which in turn grow share of sales and profit. These strategies were delivering strong results before the crisis, have served us well during these more recent volatile times that we believe will continue to serve us well post crisis. We are optimistic about our crisis prospects and generally like our hand. We will undoubtedly experience some volatility as we move through the crisis and quarterly results will not move in a straight line and are more difficult to predict. In many countries, the number of COVID cases unfortunately are the worst they have been. Risk of supply chain disruption remains high. Channel closures will likely continue. There continues to be social unrest and economic distress in many parts of the world that also affect the prospects for category growth. Against this challenging backdrop, we continue to hold ourselves to an expectation of continued growth, top line and bottom line and expect to be highly cash generative. With that context, back to Andre to discuss guidance. Andre Schulten : So, with three strong quarters behind us and having raised guidance twice across all key metrics we are maintaining our outlook for organic sales growth and core EPS growth for the fiscal year. We are increasing our outlook for adjusted free cash flow productivity and cash returns to shareowners. We continue to expect organic sales growth in the range of 5% to 6% for the fiscal year. This outlook reflects continued volatility from both base period and current year dynamics, including a challenging fourth quarter base period in the U.S. and in Greater China and continued soft market conditions in Europe and in enterprise markets. Our core earnings per share guidance remains in the range of 8% to 10%. This bottom line outlook includes headwinds of approximately $150 million after-tax of foreign exchange and now more than $200 million after-tax of higher freight costs. Commodities are now forecast to be a headwind of approximately $125 million after tax. This is a $400 million swing to the negative since our initial guidance for the year with much of this impact affecting our fiscal fourth quarter. As we stand today, our internal estimates for organic sales growth are above the midpoint of the fiscal year guidance range. On the bottom line, we are trending towards the midpoint of the core EPS range. We are again raising our target for adjusted free cash flow productivity from 90% starting the year to now over 100%. We expect to pay over $8 billion in dividends and are further increasing our outlook for share repurchase from up to $10 billion to approximately $11 billion. Combined, we plan to return about $19 billion of cash to shareowners this fiscal year. This outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates, significant currency weakness, commodity cost increases, additional geopolitical disruptions, major production stoppages or additional store closures are not anticipated within this guidance range. The commodity cost challenges we faced this year will obviously be larger next fiscal year. We will offset a portion of this impact with price increases. Our Baby Care, Feminine Care and adult incontinence businesses have announced price increases in the United States that will go into effect in mid-September. The exact timing and amount of increases vary by brand and sub-brand in the range of mid to high single-digits. As opportunities allow, we will close a couple of price increases with new product innovations, adding value for consumers. We are analyzing raw material and foreign exchange impacts in other categories and markets and we are assessing the need for additional pricing moves. Back to Jon for closing comments. Jon Moeller : Thanks, Andre. Our business exhibited strong momentum as I said earlier well before the COVID crisis. We have strengthened our position further during the crisis and we believe P&G is well positioned to serve to heighten needs and new behaviors of consumers and our retail and distributor partners post-crisis. We will manage what could be a volatile short to mid-term, consistent with the strategy we have outlined many times and again, this morning and against the immediate priorities of ensuring employee health and safety, maximizing availability of our products to serve cleaning, health and hygiene needs and helping society overcome the challenges of this crisis. We are stepping forward, not back. We are doubling down to serve our consumers and our communities. We are doing this in our interest, in the society\u2019s interest and in the interest of our long-term shareowners. We look forward to talking with you through the quarter and look forward to having David join us on the year end call in July, when we will provide our initial outlook for fiscal \u201822. With that, we will be happy to take questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : Hey, guys. Good morning. So on the pricing and commodity front, Jon, you have been in the corporate finance or leadership role for almost 15 years now. So, can you just give us some perspective on this commodity spike and what we are seeing in terms of magnitude versus past cycles and your view on longevity? And then on the pricing front, as a response to that, I know you are not going to want to be precise on forward pricing. But just holistically, given the large magnitude of this commodity increase, I would love to get a bit of a sense even if it\u2019s nebulous on what sort of the end goal is with pricing eventually? Is it to fully cover commodity increases? Is it to mostly cover? It\u2019s obviously a timing lag, but sort of the ultimate offsets to higher cost through pricing, any perspective there? And then last and apologies for the multipart question, but you are in the fortunate position of strong market share gains heading into this pricing cycle and kudos obviously a lot of hard work to be in that position. But how might that change your willingness to be bolder on pricing or even put at risk some of those market share gains that you do in fact take pricing? Thanks. Jon Moeller : Thanks, Dara. First, in comparison to prior cycles, this is one of the bigger increases in commodity costs that we\u2019ve seen over the period of time that I have been involved with this, which is a fairly long period of time. That\u2019s not all bad. When commodities move significantly and obviously they affect everyone, including both manufacturer brands and own label retail brands, the industry has pushed to price. When they move modestly, it can be much more difficult in that regard. We are also blessed to have very strong innovation in market and coming to market, which provides an opportunity to price in a value-accretive manner. We define value holistically. And we will be looking \u2013 our overall objective is to cover cost increases. It\u2019s important \u2013 and I want to emphasize that, because I didn\u2019t say cover or restore margin. It\u2019s covering cost increases, which is inherently a little bit margin-dilutive, but we think that strikes the right balance, particularly when we can combine that pricing with innovation and increased perception of value across the portfolio. If we do that well, we should continue to grow markets, and we have talked about the math of growing markets. We do that disproportionately, which is certainly our intention. We will not lose share. We will, in effect, well, necessarily build share. All of that is easy to talk about. All of that is hard to execute. And it\u2019s done at a very detailed level by brand, by market. And so it will play out differently across the world. The last very important point on this topic I want to make, if we go back to large commodity cost increase cycles in the past, this company had not yet fully embedded productivity into its mindset and activity system, and that will be a significant part of this endeavor going forward as well. And we feel good about opportunities to continue to increase productivity to help us manage this situation. Operator : All right. Your next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citi. Wendy Nicholson : Hi, good morning. I actually wanted to ask about your approach to some of the markets like India. To the extent COVID runs rampant, gets worse, I know in the developed markets over the last 9 months, 12 months, it wasn\u2019t easy for you, but you were able to offset sort of some of the supply chain disruptions, e-commerce took off, all of that. But I am just wondering how you plan to manage in a place like India or some of the other enterprise markets, Africa, if COVID is a lingering problem, and you don\u2019t have the e-commerce option nearly as much in those markets. Is there a risk that those regions turn significantly negative for you or significantly more expensive to operate? Just how are you thinking about that and planning for that at this point? Thanks. Jon Moeller : Thank you, Wendy. Many of these markets do indeed represent significant challenges, and I think it\u2019s important we talk about that a little bit. So, that\u2019s why I appreciate the question. The health situation in markets like India, Brazil, Turkey is worse than it\u2019s ever been. The number of new cases, the number of hospitalizations, the number of deaths, unfortunately, was higher in the last week and over the weekend than has ever been the case. These markets do not have the healthcare infrastructure nor the financial means to provide subsidies to their citizenry. And as a result, when this happens, employment is affected. Consumption is affected. GDP is down significantly in some of these markets. No better time to help and to serve our consumers at a time of real need. We need to do that in a profitable way. And frankly, we, knock on wood, have never been more profitable in enterprise markets than we are as we sit here conversing today. So, the operational discipline that\u2019s required is significant. We will have to make choices, but I fully expect, to the main point of your question, that these will be markets that will continue to offer top and bottom line growth opportunities for our company. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Steve Powers : Yes. Thanks. Can we talk a little bit more about what you are seeing in baby and family, specifically, because you call out retailer destocking and higher competitive activity, I guess just curious if you see that continuing. And if so, I guess, how does that impact your decision to follow what we heard from Kimberly-Clark on announced pricing in the U.S., but doing so on a 2.5-month to 3-month lag and seemingly only on baby and feminine and incontinence \u2013 yet not on Family Care categories. So, just how should investors interpret that tactical positioning in the context of ultimately doing what\u2019s optimal for category growth? And I guess kind of relatively, is there anything that you have announced today preclude other revenue growth management activities that might help drive higher net price in Baby and Family overall as we go forward. I guess, specifically, I am thinking about potential de-sheeting or other kind of net price accretive activities in tissue categories that might not be a list price increase? Thanks. Jon Moeller : Steve, let me briefly address family, and then I am going to ask Andre to comment on Baby Care since U.S. Baby Care was the business that he led most recently. He is still very close to what\u2019s happening there. We are pricing in the three categories that you mentioned because that\u2019s where the commodity costs are \u2013 the increases are the more significant. It\u2019s really that simple. From a Family Care standpoint, demand continues to be strong. We grew Family Care 5% in the quarter that we just completed. That\u2019s even despite some reduction in household pantry inventory. But the usage at home continues to be above pre-COVID levels, and we are managing the balance between home inventory, store inventory and our own production very, very carefully. But the price increases for the near-term are going to be focused, as you rightly mentioned, in baby, family and adult incontinence, the largest of those is baby. I will ask Andre to comment on that. Andre Schulten : Yes. As you mentioned, I think quarter 3 was significantly impacted due to retailer inventory build in the early phases of the pandemic and Europe focus markets and in the U.S. We expect that to normalize over the next few quarters. Most importantly, the team is really focusing on building irresistible superiority across all vectors in baby, every form and every price tier. And where we do that successfully, we see the results turning. You have heard us talk about U.S. value share being up 130 basis points plus 1. In Europe, where we have also invested in superiority, France, Germany, Spain, Russia, are all up in terms of value share significantly in excess of a point. So, bringing innovation at the same time as we price is the ideal scenario, which we are pushing in the U. S. Now slower growth rates and commodity pressures will continue to be headwinds. So, we need to acknowledge that. So productivity will also be a continued element of that toolbox we have to use to drive growth. But as we focus on superiority, drive market value, we have a business model that works as illustrated in the U. S. and Europe. Operator : Alright. Next question will come from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks. Good morning, I wanted to talk a little bit about the role that top-line growth plays in, I guess, profitability. So, just thinking through the streamlined organization structure, not thinking about incremental productivity, but just rather the benefit that you see to profitability from top-line growth here, what sort of \u2013 is it 3%, 4%, where you see material operating leverage, particularly at the gross margin line, but also in SG&A. And then related to that, 2020 was a year where there was remarkable reinvestment into the business and that the share gains speak to that. But as you look ahead to \u201822, I guess how would you describe the status of your commercial plan, are you fully funded at current investment levels, is there a need to kind of keep ramping up at this rate or is the spend level feel about right where it is today? Thanks. Jon Moeller : Let me make just a few overarching comments, Lauren, and then have Andre talk about the income statement \u2013 leverage and the top-line growth leverage that you asked about. And the first overarching comment I want to make is we are literally just beginning to put together plans for \u201822. So, I apologize, but we really don\u2019t have anything terribly intelligent or cohesive to talk about that. I do not expect, however, our priorities to change. I do not expect our strategy to change. I do not expect our business model to change. But the specifics of that are early in their development, and we look forward to talking to you about that, along with David, in July. I will turn it over to Andre just to talk about the income statement leverage. Andre Schulten : Yes. So to answer your question, our \u2013 we are growing mid-singles, so call it 3% to 4% on top-line. We have started to see some modest benefit to sales leverage. It really starts to gain traction above 4% growth rate across the income statement, and that\u2019s what we have seen, I think in the most recent quarters. So, that\u2019s a sweet spot where we want to be. Mid-singles growth allows for sustained margin expansion, which is our growth model that we are going after. Jon Moeller : Of course, that\u2019s all in the context of for example, relatively constant commodity costs and no significant impacts from currency, etcetera. Our current outlook for market growth, and again, this changes on a daily, weekly, monthly basis, would be between 3% and 4%, likely rounding to 4%. Our objective is to grow ahead of that by disproportionately contributing to market growth. So, that would put us in the margin square that Andre outlined, again, prior to big impacts from other commodities or currency. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Hey, good morning folks. I think you spot me in. Much appreciate it. I wanted to make sure I understood the guidance comments, because to get to above the midpoint of your sales outlook, but only to the midpoint or so of the EPS outlook, I need to take my EBIT margins down close to 300 basis points year-on-year in the fourth quarter. Is that the right way to think about it or are there other below the line headwinds to contemplate? And if we are talking about that type of margin degradation in the fourth quarter, can you give us more color on the puts and takes, is this an investment posture or is it just the commodities are hitting a lot of gross margin pressure before pricing sets in, any sort of context or color you can provide to help us dimensionalize that? Thank you. Jon Moeller : Thank you. Why don\u2019t I let Andre start on that and I will jump in. Andre Schulten : Yes. I think overall, I think you are reading it the right way. On the top-line, we see ourselves above the midpoint of the guidance range. On the EPS side, the main drivers, I would call out that will impact the balance of the fiscal year are macro factors. When you think about commodities, we had a 1% EPS headwind in quarter 3. But now we have included $125 million after-tax headwinds for commodities in the guidance. That will largely hit in quarter 4. Foreign exchange rate continues to be a headwind $150 million after tax, which is up $50 million versus what we have talked in our quarter 2 call. And then transportation would be the last element I would mention, at about $200 million after-tax included in the current guidance. Rates continue to be up. Drivers and rigs continue to be in short supply. Sea freight continues to be at a premium. So, we continue to see that pressure mounting and also impacting quarter two. Jon Moeller : We will also continue to the point of your question on a couple of \u2013 previously, to maintain a very healthy investment profile to continue to hold and build our margin of superiority. And we will also continue, obviously, with our strong productivity program, which we will fund by effort. And with that, we are left back where Andre left us. Operator : And next, we will go to Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : Great. Thanks. Good morning everyone. Jon, I wanted to come back to the topic of pricing and commodities because I think it\u2019s important. So, just in the interest of clarity here, the pricing that you outlined for the U.S. in baby, fem and adult care comes behind Kimberly\u2019s announcement. But then to an earlier question, as you commented, this is one of the bigger commodity cost increases that the industry has had to cope with historically. So, I just wanted to come back, why only these categories and why only the U.S., because it\u2019s certainly far beyond just pulp. And then within that context, Jon, to your credit and to the team\u2019s credit, Procter has done a remarkable job here in terms of improving market share to put the company in a position to take price behind the leading brand portfolio in these circumstances. So, I think the question is what is giving you pause here in terms of broader pricing beyond just the categories where you are seeing it following Kimberly\u2019s pricing announcement. So, why just these categories and why just the U.S.? And then I am sorry for being a little bit verbose here, but just on commodity outlook, I think to the extent that you can quantify, I know you don\u2019t want to give guidance, but some further degree of quantification beyond just June, beyond just your fiscal year, I think would be helpful for folks? So, thank you for all that. Jon Moeller : Thank you, Kevin. Pricing is a topic that we are limited in the perspective that we can actually provide relative to specific brands in country and in plans that relate to specific brands and countries. I wouldn\u2019t \u2013 I would suggest that we not take that reality and conclude necessarily, but the only categories we are taking pricing in are the ones that have been mentioned. And the only country that we are taking pricing is the one that has been mentioned. This will be a holistic effort with productivity in mind, with innovation in mind. We are \u2013 our business model positions us on a relative basis well to deal with these situations for 2 reasons. One I have just mentioned, which is productivity is part of the culture, part of our DNA. We don\u2019t have to start a program. Our program for next year is well underway. The second is an even more important way, is an innovation based business model, which positions us with opportunities to take pricing in a way that\u2019s actually value accretive to consumers. And you can imagine that if you have those opportunities and they are spread out across the year, your pricing might be announced at different timing and might take effect at different times throughout the year. I would offer you 1 data point or 2 data points. Pricing has been, and it speaks to the business model point. Pricing has been a positive contributor to our top-line \u2013 sorry, a neutral or a positive contributor, but mostly positive to our top-line for 42 quarters out of the last 46 quarters and 15 years out of the last 16 years. That doesn\u2019t guarantee anything going forward, but it points to the \u2013 again, the nature of our business model, which provides no guarantees, but does put us in a relatively better position with ways to help the top-line and the bottom-line as we work to manage this and continue to create value. Relative to the question on impact of commodities for next year, as I said earlier, we are really early in the process of putting next year together, couple that with a very volatile, both commodity and FX environment, and I would rather help you with specifics that are meaningful, closer to the beginning of the year. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Rob Ottenstein with Evercore ISI. Rob Ottenstein : Great. Thank you very much. With 14% of your sales now coming from e-commerce, and I think you said growing 50%, that\u2019s pretty much all the growth, so in that context and given the fact that channel continues to spread, it\u2019s not just Amazon, it\u2019s Walmart and Target, can you ask \u2013 answer two questions? One, how \u2013 and maybe just the U.S. and China, how has that channel and the competition in that channel evolved over the last year or so? And what specific things can you point to that you are working on now that will give you superiority in that channel on a sustainable basis? Thank you. Jon Moeller : Thanks, Robert. The figures you referenced relative to channel growth are the correct figures as we see them. The growth is significant in both U.S. and China. Both markets have become even more competitive in the e-commerce channel, but I would argue that was true in brick-and-mortar channels as well or global market places becoming more global. And there is strong and healthy competition across channels and markets. The biggest opportunity for us from a superiority standpoint in the e-commerce channel, there are several. But fundamentally, first, second and third is, as you mentioned, superiority. That carries the day in this channel and categories where performance drives brand choice, as much as it does in every other channel. Now we need to scale our offerings in a way that best serve e-commerce and digital commerce consumers. And an example of one of the things we\u2019re working on there is packaging, particularly for liquid products, ensuring those products survive the journey to a consumer\u2019s home and when she opens box with delight. The conditions that, that bottle travels through are much more strenuous in an e-commerce context, and we need to have packaging that\u2019s designed for that in mind. So that\u2019s just an example. But the mindset of superiority across everything is the same in that channel as well as any other channels. Andre, I don\u2019t know if you have any more perspective on that question from a Baby Care perspective. Andre Schulten : Well, the only other point I would make is I think the strength of our brands is a big effort when you come to e-comm. It ensures that we can be on the landing page in the search top results. I think the strength of our brands also plays to when you think about click and collect, our availability in terms of shells and therefore not being increase up for another Brent when we are out of stock, I think is a big advantage. So our logistics capability, I think, can create value in conjunction with retailers in the supply chain that is driven by e-com. So I think there are many areas of strength that we can apply to make sure we\u2019re competitive in that environment. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Nik Modi : Yes. Thank you. Good morning everyone. So Jon, I was wondering if you can just talk about out of stocks. And from the standpoint of COVID-related demand, but it\u2019s more about the supply chain tension between e-commerce and brick-and-mortar, just given the prior \u2013 Robert\u2019s prior question about just the enormous growth that we\u2019re seeing and all the retailers are getting much more involved or much more aggressive in that channel. So just was hoping to get some context around that? Thank you. Jon Moeller : Encouragingly, in-stock and available on shelf is becoming a very common language for us and our retail partners. It is front and center in the development of our joint business plans, and we have opportunities there, as do our retail partners. And that landscape of opportunities is changing all the time. Andre mentioned click and collect. That presents a unique set of challenges and opportunities as it relates to having products available. We\u2019re well positioned in that space, as he mentioned. But this is an area that is receiving a lot of intentional focus both internally and, importantly, in partnership with our retail partners. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : Good morning and welcome, Andre. I wanted to go back to the pricing commentary, and I know we\u2019ve beaten up this topic a lot, but I understand you can\u2019t preannounce pricing for pretty much other categories. But in past cycles, we used innovation in packaging and distributing, also I understand that you don\u2019t necessary need to publicly announce pricing outside the U.S. So what are the other reasons you have seen room for price/mix to move in the right direction? And also, you talked about increasing competitive activity in leading China. So how are you planning to respond to that? Thank you. Jon Moeller : I think I caught most of that. We\u2019re going to refrain from commenting specific pricing moves in any country across any category. That\u2019s just a better place to be. Again, we\u2019ve talked a lot about intent on this call and we\u2019ve talked about mechanism and method on this call, and I think those are clear. And the rest, we are going to have to stay tuned if available. It also would not make a lot of sense for us to talk about price increases in certain markets and certain categories without having had a discussion with our retail partners. So I\u2019m really \u2013 I apologize, but I said what I could say on pricing, I think it\u2019s very constructive in terms of both our intent and our ability to balance that in a way that makes sense for everybody. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse. Kaumil Gajrawala : Thank you everybody. Can you talk a bit about the mix effects on margins? Obviously, the U.S. and China were quite strong last year. And now you are going to be comping a lot of that and what you are seeing from recovering at the end? And then also within kind of the context of mix but more from a channel perspective, maybe an update on what you\u2019re seeing and expecting for travel retail? Thanks. Jon Moeller : I will turn it over to our CFO to help you with mix. Andre Schulten : Alright. So from a gross margin perspective, you will have seen, we have about a negative 40 basis points from mix. We\u2019re actually being helped by the strong growth that we see in the U.S. and China from a region mix perspective. But you see negative segment mix impact in the quarter mainly driven by faster growth in Home Care and in Appliances and personal healthcare being down on the quarter. I want to call out that negative 40 basis points is not necessarily a negative structurally. Many of our premium propositions in the market come with significantly higher unit sales and unit profit, though with slightly dilutive gross margin mix impact, when you think about, for example, 50% premium on a unit sales basis, 20% higher penny profit, but minus 6% on a margin perspective. So, the same is true for Pampers Pure. When you think about fem care radiant variants, so premiumization, to some degree, carries a margin impact, but we much prefer the penny profit over the margin as we follow that strategy. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Chris Carey : Hi, good morning. I actually just wanted to ask you question about SK-II perhaps also Olay in just specifically China, you see some big numbers out of China from other companies not specifically Skin Care and perhaps just a little bit surprise of the sequential development in that business specifically on the easier comps. So, I wonder if you could just talk to how your SK-II business specifically and Olay came in relative to your expectations and, in general, what you are seeing from the Asian Skin Care market in general? Thanks. Jon Moeller : There is a lot going on within Asia Skin Care. For many of the prestige beauty companies, big parts of their business were severely impacted by COVID. Think about salon-based treatments, offerings that went through specialty beauty channels, which are effectively shut, as an example, travel retail. And as a result, they are smartly investing in a category that continues to offer significant growth, is very profitable and is open, and that is China Skin Care. So, one dynamic that we have happening is a lot of competitive activity. That\u2019s not inherently bad. That grows markets. And if you look at, for example, SK-II, we grew SK-II globally strong double digits, over 30% in the quarter that we just completed. Within that, Mainland China, we grew over 50%. Part of that dynamic is something else that\u2019s going on, which is the movement of purchase from travel retail and from travel in general, so for example, consumers traveling to Japan to buy prestige beauty products, which they are no longer doing. That purchase that, consumption has not gone away, and that purchase is shifting into the Chinese market, which is feeding significant growth if you report business on a mainland China basis. But it\u2019s very encouraging that we\u2019re delivering the growth that we are in SK-II. It\u2019s been a little bit tougher for Olay, simply because one of the mechanisms that companies are using to compete and take advantage of this opportunity is to reduce prices. And so the gap between Olay and some of the others kind of changes the competitive dynamic. And quite frankly, we need to work to premiumize our lines even more to be fully competitive with some of these brands, which we\u2019re in the midst of doing. But overall, beauty grew 7%. Skin and Personal Care grew 7%. Hair Care grew 7%. We\u2019ve grown organic sales for 22 quarters. It\u2019s a business we really like, and SK-II is an important part of it, as is Olay. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark Astrachan : Yes. Thanks and good morning everybody. I wanted to ask just more broadly about how to think about operating margins on a go-forward basis, not necessarily from a guidance perspective, but just how much of the pretty strong EBIT margin expansion we\u2019ve seen kind of since fiscal \u201819, depending on where you come in, in 4Q, something 250 basis points or more, mainly led by gross margin? How much of that should we be thinking about sticking in the business? I hear you on the commodities and the pricing and pricing to protect how you were referring to before on margin. So can you maybe help us a little bit more about how much of that is maybe leverage from stronger sales and how much of that can actually continue on a go-forward basis? Maybe just sort of puts and takes that we don\u2019t necessarily see in looking at the numbers. Jon Moeller : Well, certainly, a continuation of sales growth rate is important to maintain some level of margin growth rate. And we\u2019ve been very clear about that from the beginning. I also think that you need to be careful when you think just about commodities in terms of its effect on the gross margin, even on a net basis of pricing because that\u2019s not the only thing going on. So for example, there have been significant cost increases associated with COVID in terms of being able to operate safely and successfully that we would expect over some period of time, God willing, as we get through this, both here and in other countries could be an opportunity for productivity and cost reduction. So this \u2013 I\u2019ve talked about this many times, but there is a chart that I show our leadership team meeting, our team whenever we get together, which simply shows the importance of the combination of sales growth and margin growth and delivering top third TSR. And the simple fact is that if we don\u2019t grow margin and we want to deliver top third TSR, we would need to be comfortable sustainably growing sales, organic sales 8% every year. And that\u2019s not something that our industry has historically done. It\u2019s not something we\u2019ve historically done, but we remain committed through our innovation programs, through productivity, through the right amount of pricing to continue some level of operating margin growth. Operator : And your final question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge. Jonathan Feeney : Thanks very much guys. I wanted to follow-up maybe for a finer point in an earlier line of questions. E-commerce, we talked about for years about what it would look like we saw this level of e-commerce dramatically higher. And I wanted maybe to put \u2013 I know that varies widely by category and by region. You mentioned the U.S. and China. I know categories were pretty significant as well. So I would ask, are you as stronger in categories that have developed more in e-commerce? And are you more profitable in totality, in your judgment, in those categories? And I asked that because I think that\u2019s the direction we\u2019re going in a lot of categories, and I think that affects the overall competitive look 5 years down the road. Thank you. Jon Moeller : I would say that our position as regards superiority, again, in categories where performance drives brand ice and our advantage versus competition in that regard as well as the other vectors of superiority has a stronger correlation with our results than the development of any channel within the category or across categories. In aggregate, our market shares in e-commerce are about equal to brick-and-mortar. There are countries where it\u2019s lower. There are countries where it\u2019s higher. There are categories where it\u2019s lower. There are categories where it\u2019s higher. And the same is true generally for margin. So all that put together wouldn\u2019t necessarily indicate that were preferenced by the development of one channel versus the other. And of course, you also get into \u2013 increasingly, we should be talking about digital commerce. And that is, as someone mentioned earlier on the call, just as important for Walmart or Target as it is for Amazon or Alibaba. So when we think about channel differences, that historically, in the past, was a customer difference. That\u2019s no longer the case. So there is a blending that\u2019s occurring as well. But we are very comfortable and, in fact, encouraged by the development of digital commerce in general across all of those forms. We feel we\u2019re well positioned. Andre mentioned some of the reasons earlier. I have talked ad nauseam about how this is actually a limited assortment environment as opposed to an unlimited assortment environment and as a result, how the barriers to entry can be even higher for non leading brands in some of these channels. But we want to be available, relevant, super attractive, wherever consumers want to shop, and if it happens to be more digital commerce, we\u2019re prepared to serve. Jon Moeller : So I think that\u2019s \u2013 yes, I want to thank everybody for your time. I really do feel we\u2019re in a good place, albeit with challenges, as we\u2019ve talked in this call. Again, I go to \u2013 let me just quickly go through one dynamic. We talked about how \u2013 the biggest question that I get is, what\u2019s this all going to look like post COVID. And I look at just a couple of things as indicators of that. I don\u2019t have the full answer. But if we go back to a COVID-normalized, non-affected environment, so how are we growing pre-COVID? We were growing the top line at about 6%. We were growing the bottom line high singles. So, very strong momentum with the current strategy and a portfolio of leading brands and daily use categories for performance stage franchise and a very effective, highly competent organization executing against that strategy. All of that has carried forward into COVID and has built momentum. So fiscal year-to-date, as we were talking earlier, organic sales up 7% core earnings per share up 14%. And if we flash forward to a transition to post COVID normal, whatever that looks like. I would just point to two data points. Our two largest markets, the U.S. is arguably beginning the transition to a new normal; China has arguably transitioned to a new level or closer to that than most other large countries. In the U.S., in the last quarter, we grew 7% on the top line. In China in the last quarter, we grew 22% on the top line, albeit against a base that was partly lockdown-affected. If you look at it on a 2-year stack basis, we\u2019re up 12%. We are also importantly globally, on an aggregate basis, building share. And none of that is to brag, and none of that is to guarantee future success. But as I look at that combination of data, it\u2019s hard to believe that those same strategies, brands, people that delivered success pre-COVID and during COVID are all of a sudden not going to be delivering attractive results. And that\u2019s our commitment and our plan. With that, we will let you go. Again, thank you very, very much for your time this morning. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to Procter & Gamble's quarter end conference call. Today's event is being recorded for replay. This discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections. As required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that, during the discussion, the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business trends and has posted on its Investor Relations website, www.pginvestor.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Now I will turn the call over to P&G's Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, David Taylor. David Taylor : Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. Last evening, we announced that I will retire as CEO on November 1 and John Moeller was elected as the incoming CEO. I will remain as Executive Chair of the Board. We also announced that Shailesh Jejurikar has been elected Chief Operating Officer effective October 1, 2021, transitioning behind John Moeller. These moves have been thoughtfully planed and provide P&G with highly capable and experienced leadership going forward. I truly have full confidence and strongly support these changes. John, you know, well, he has a distinguished track record throughout his 33-year career with P&G, including more than 12 years as CFO. More recently, John added responsibilities as Vice-Chairman and then Chief Operating Officer with P&L responsibility and ownership for our enterprise markets. In my nearly six years as CEO, I've had the benefit of partnering with John and an outstanding global leadership team to integrate a comprehensive set of strategies to guide our choices and priorities. Now to go back, in 2012, John led the initial work to make productivity, an integral part of P&G\u2019s business. Our team doubled down on this strategy when we announced our second five-year $10 billion cost savings program in 2017. Today, productivity is built into our operating model and is an ongoing part of our strategy in every part of our business. We worked together for several years to focus the company's portfolio on faster growing, more profitable daily use categories, where product solve problems and performance drives consumer brand choice. The team largely completed this work with the divestiture of several fashion driven beauty categories in 2016. This strategy continues to guide our disciplined approach to managing our category and brand portfolio. At the CAGNY Conference in 2016, we first discussed the test we were doing on a new approach to our organization design. We refined and formalize the plans and announced the new focus market and enterprise market design at our November 2018 Analyst Day. Our objective was to create a more engaged, agile and accountable organization, which is exactly what we've done. In April, 2017, we first discussed our work to set a much higher bar for measuring the success of our innovation and execution across products, packaging, brand communication, retail execution and value. If there were any doubts about the importance of consistently delivering irresistible superiority, our results over the last few years should have put those to bed. And finally, in 2018, we first talked about the need to lead constructive disruption in our highly dynamic and competitive industry. We continue to drive disruption in innovation, brand building, digitization, supply chain transformation, and with our citizenship and ESG efforts. Over several years through many challenges, our organization responded brilliantly as we integrated each element of the strategy, building momentum that is evident in our results in the past three fiscal years. The team fully embraced the idea that we must be willing to change anything and everything needed to win. The only things we will not change are our purpose, values, and principles in our commitment to winning. This has been especially evident during the continuing COVID crisis where the organization has demonstrated from ministry agility to meet the needs of consumers while ensuring the safety of our employees in supporting communities around the world to deal with the impacts of this crisis. Through all of it, delivering results, should delight owners and do it in a way that makes us proud to be P&G years. Put simply our strategies are working, our team is outstanding and I could not be more confident in the next-generation of leadership that will take the range of P&G later this year. Now let's turn it over to Andre Schulten, Chief Financial Officer, to lead us through the fiscal year 2021 fourth quarter and yearend earnings announcement. Andre? Andre Schulten : Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Joining David and me on the call today are Jon Moeller, Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer; and John Chevalier, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. I'll start with an overview of company results for fiscal 2021 and fourth quarter and David will add perspective on our immediate priorities and strategic focus areas. We'll close with guidance for fiscal 2022. And then take your questions. Fiscal 2021 was another very strong year. Our focus on superiority and strong investment in the business, funded with strong productivity improvements and cost savings drove market growth, and it turns strong sales share earnings and cash results leading to balance growth and value creation. Organic sales for the fiscal year grew more than 6%, up more than 12% on a two-year stack. Growth was broad-based across business units with each our 10 product categories growing or holding organic sales. Home Care up high teens, Oral Care up double digits, Skin and Personal Care up high single digits, Grooming, Fabric Care, Feminine Care, Hair Care and Personal Health Care, organic sales each up mid-single digits, Family Care grew low singles, Baby Care was in line with prior year. We delivered strong results in our two largest and most profitable markets annualizing strong base periods. Organic sales were up 8% in the U.S. and 12% in greater China for the fiscal year. Focus markets grew 7% for the year. Enterprise markets were up 5% despite significant market growth impacts from the pandemic. E-commerce sales were up 35% for the year at over $10 billion in sales representing 14% of company total. Global aggregate market share increased 50 basis points, 33 of our top 50 category country combinations held or grew share for the fiscal year. All outlet value share in the U.S. improved through the year growing from 33% over the past 12 months, to 33.5% for the past six months, to 34% over the past quarter. One of the highest absolute value shares in the last 20 years. Consumers are increasingly choosing P&G brands. We translated the strong top-line growth into strong earnings and cash results. Core earnings per share grew 11% for the year. Currency neutral core EPS was also up 11%. Within this core gross margin expanded 20 basis points, up 60 basis points excluding currency impacts. Core operating margin grew 80 basis points up 130 points, excluding currency impacts. Productivity improvements helped operating margin by 250 basis points, enabling strong \u2013 reinvestment in marketing programs. Advertising was a 10.8% of sales, an increase of more than 40 basis points. Adjusted free cashflow productivity was 107%. We increased our dividend by 10% and returned $19 billion of value to share owners, $8 billion in dividends and $11 billion in share repurchase. Moving on to the April, June quarter, organic sales grew 4%, volume, pricing and mix, each contributed more than one point to topline growth. Growth rates by market reflected the volatility and shipments and the base period. Organic sales were down 1% in the U.S. However, this is still 18% growth on a two-year stack. Recall that in the April, June quarter last year, organic sales were up 19% in the U.S. 13 points above track channel sales as we work to restock depleted trade inventories. Organic sales in greater China were up 5% also comping a strong base period, on a two-year stack, Greater China up 19%. Focus markets were up 2%, enterprise markets were up 14% in the quarter. Strong market share trends with aggregate global value share up 70 basis points. All the share in the U.S. increased 260 basis points for the quarter to 34.1%.  On the bottom line, core earnings per share were $1.13, down 3% versus prior year, down 4% on a currency neutral basis, mainly due to gross margin pressure from higher input cost as we had anticipated. Core gross margin decreased 260 basis points, currency neutral core gross margin also down 260 points. This includes 220 basis points impact from higher commodity and freight costs, nearly 400 million in just this quarter. We also saw a sharp headwind from mix of 210 basis points, mainly geographic mix impacts. Recall that in our fourth quarter last year, the U.S. and China accounted for more than 100% of organic sales growth. In this year\u2019s fourth quarter Enterprise Markets lead the growth. Core operating margin decreased 230 basis points. Currency neutral core operating margin declined 210 basis points. Productivity improvements were 320 basis point helped to the quarter. Adjusted free cash flow in the quarter was 117%. In summary, we exceeded each of our growth targets for the year. Organic sales growth, core EPS growth, free chase productivity, and cash returned to shareholders. Our team has operated with excellent discipline in a challenging and volatile environment. And with that, I'll pass it back to David. David Taylor : Thanks, Andre. As I said at the outset, our team has done some outstanding work over the last 18 months to manage through the challenges of the COVID crisis and make our business even stronger in the process. In our April earnings call last year, we said we would step forward into the challenge of COVID not back. We said we would double down to serve consumers, and that's exactly what our team has done. As we continue to manage the crisis, we will remain focused on the three priorities that have been guiding our near-term actions and choices. First, is ensuring the health and safety of our P&G colleagues around the world. Second, maximizing the availability of our products to help people and their families with their cleaning, health and hygiene needs. And third priority supporting the communities, relief agencies and people who are on the frontlines of this global pandemic. The strategic choices that I outlined earlier are the foundation for balanced top and bottom-line growth and long-term value creation. Portfolio of daily use products, many providing cleaning health and hygiene benefits in categories where performance plays a significant role in brand choice. In these performance-driven categories, we've raised the bar on all aspects of superiority, product, package, brand communication, retail execution, and value. Superior offerings delivered with superior execution drive market growth. I'd like share just a few examples. First in our Oral Care business, superior offerings to driving market growth across forms. Last summer, we launched Oral-B iO power brush, which offers an irresistible consumer brushing experience. The value of this superior performance is evident to the consumers, even with the premium price. P&G\u2019s global value share in the brush segment is up more than 2.5 points over the past year. And the U.S. power brush category is up nearly 14 points since the innovation launched, with IO contributing more than half of the category growth. We recently launched the next breakthrough in teeth whitening Crest Whitening Emulsions create a micro thin layer of concentrated peroxide droplets, enabling consumers to move beyond occasion-based whitening to a product that can be used up to four times per day with no rinsing or brushing needed. This innovation is a leading contributor to our more than 20% organic sales growth of our tooth whitening business in fiscal 2021. And it's driving two-thirds of the U.S. whitening category growth. In Personal Health Care, NyQuil and DayQuil Honey launched last summer, offering a great tasting formula, while also delivering powerful relief. NyQuil Honey is the number one new item in the U.S. respiratory market and our Vicks share is up 90 basis points over the past 12 months despite the soft market due to the very weak cough-cold season. When consumers are shopping in the category, they\u2019re increasingly choosing Vicks. For some consumers, the environmental aspects of our product offering are taking on increased importance in their assessment of superiority. We are offering a superior performing product or products that are more sustainable in educating consumers on the benefits of those products with superior brand communication. I\u2019ll switch to Fabric Care. Here, Tide and Ariel are innovating to extend their superior cleaning performance advantages, while encouraging consumers to reduce their carbon footprint. Ariels\u2019 new campaign Every Degree Makes a Difference advocates lower washing temperatures. Up to 60% of laundry\u2019s carbon footprint comes from heating the water in the washing machine. Lowering the wash temperature is the single most important thing we can do to reduce the environmental impact of laundry. To achieve our goals, we continue to innovate to ensure superior fabric cleaning performance in cold water and we utilized superior communication to educate the consumer on the benefits. This innovation has helped contribute to global Fabric Care\u2019s 120 basis points of value share growth over the past 12 months. In our European Shave Care business, we\u2019re driving superiority across all five vectors and improving sustainability along the way. We\u2019re moving to a plastic-free packaging on our razor systems, simplifying our lineup, improving on shelf fundamentals and improving margin for our retail partners. This innovation contributed to mid-single-digit organic sales growth in our European Grooming business in fiscal 2021 with market share up one point; good business results and good for the environment. This packaging innovation will save the equivalent of 85 million water bottles per year when it\u2019s fully launched around the world. More important and one example is the common theme of superior innovation and execution that drives market growth. Leading category growth builds business for our retail partners and mathematically builds market share for P&G. We\u2019ve made investments to strengthen the long-term health and competitiveness of our brands and we\u2019ll continue to invest to extend our margin of advantage and quality of execution, improving options for consumers around the world. The strategic need for investment to contribute to strengthen the long-term health and competitiveness of our brands, the short-term need to manage through the crisis and the ongoing need to drive balanced top and bottom-line growth, including margin expansion underscore the importance of ongoing productivity. We\u2019re driving cost savings and cash productivity in all facets of our business. In cost of goods, we\u2019re delivering flexible formulations that can allow us to change between ingredients to lower cost or create supply chain flexibility, while ensuring no impact on consumer preference for our brands. We\u2019re optimizing plastic bottle designs to reduce the amount of plastics we use, while also lowering costs. We\u2019re improving the efficiency and effectiveness of our advertising investments, bringing some media planning work in-house to achieve greater cost efficiency, while also enabling us to place ads with greater precision based on more granular analytics to reduce waste and increase effectiveness. No area of cost is left untouched. We\u2019ve given more authority and accountability to the business units to decide how to balance the need for more resources in some areas of the business with the opportunities for savings in other areas. They need to make the choices that are best for their business as they work to deliver a balanced top and bottom-line growth. Our success in our highly competitive industry also requires agility that comes with the mindset of constructive disruption; a willingness to change, adapt and create new trends and technologies that will shape our industry for the future. In the current environment, that agility and constructive disruption mindset are even more important. Our organizational structure yields a more empowered, agile and accountable organization with little overlap or redundancy, flowing to meet new demands, seamlessly supporting each other to deliver against our priorities around the world. These strategic choices on portfolio, superiority, productivity, constructive disruption and organizational structure and culture are not independent strategies. They reinforce and build on each other. When executed well, they grow markets, which in turn grows share, sales and profit. These strategies were delivering strong results before the crisis, have served us well during the crisis, and they will serve us well on the other end of this crisis. We\u2019re confident they remain the right strategic choices as we move through and beyond the pandemic. We delivered strong results in fiscal 2021 in a very challenging environment. While we\u2019re pleased with these results and the overall strength of our business, the external environment continues to be volatile and difficult to predict and our eyes are wide open to the many challenges we face. We compete in product categories against highly-capable multinational and local competitors. Raw material and transport freight costs have risen sharply. Increased social unrest and economic distress in many parts of the world are putting pressure on local GDP growth and the pandemic continues to create risk for consumers, retail partners and supply chains. With these challenges, there are also opportunities as we emerge from the pandemic. The relevance of our categories in consumers\u2019 lives likely remains elevated. We will serve what will likely become a forever-altered cleaning, health and hygiene focus for consumers who use our products daily or multiple times each day. There may be a continued increased focus on home; more time at home, more meals at home with related consumption impacts. The importance of noticeably superior performance potentially grows. There is potential for increased preference for established reputable brands that solve newly-framed problems better than alternatives; potentially less experimentation; potential for a lasting shift to e-commerce, both e-tailers and omnichannel. Our experience to date makes us believe we are generally well-positioned in this environment. We\u2019re discovering lower cost ways of working with fewer resources; today\u2019s necessity giving rise to the productivity inventions of tomorrow. New digital tools are being brought to the forefront, providing another productivity driver on the factory floor, in our labs and in our office environment. Our business exhibited strong momentum well before the crisis. We strengthened our position further during the crisis, and we believe P&G is well-positioned to serve the heightened needs and new behaviors of consumers and our retail and distributor partners post-crisis. We have the right strategies, we have the right portfolio, we have the right organizational structure. We have a team of 100,000 employees focused on executing to delight consumers, win with customers and deliver balanced growth and value creation. With that, I\u2019ll hand it back to Andre to outline our guidance for fiscal 2022. Andre? Andre Schulten : As David said, we will undoubtedly experience more volatility as we move through the crisis. Our quarterly results will be heavily influenced by top-line volatility embedded in base period results, along with the realities of current year cost pressures and continued effects of the global pandemic. Input costs have risen sharply. Current spot prices for materials such as resins, chemicals and other ingredients are up anywhere from 30% to 200% versus April 2020. Most of the material cost increases occurred in this calendar year and will disproportionately affect the first half of fiscal 2022. Based on current spot prices, we estimate a $1.8 billion after-tax commodity cost headwind in fiscal 2022. Freight costs have also increased substantially due to several factors affecting the supply of drivers and the demand for drivers and trucks and diesel fuel prices are up 35% so far in the calendar. We currently expect freight and transportation costs to be an incremental $100 million after-tax headwind in fiscal 2022. We will offset a portion of these higher costs with price increases, but there is a lag between the time when costs begin to rise and when pricing is implemented to provide an offset. As discussed last quarter, our Baby Care, Feminine Care and Adult Incontinence businesses have announced increases in the U.S. that will go into effect in mid-September. Earlier this year, we executed a significant product upgrade on our Japan liquid Ariel detergent, coupled with a 35% price increase. In U.S. Fabric Care, we recently announced that this price increase on Tide Simply, Cheer, and Era liquid detergents, effective in September. In U.S. Home Care, we\u2019ve announced double-digit price increases across all product forms of the Swiffer brand. These increases are effective mid-September. We have announced price increases in many Central Eastern European markets to offset a portion of recent currency impacts. In Latin America, we\u2019ve taken a cumulative high-single-digit price increase across our business over the past 12 months. We are analyzing input costs and foreign exchange rate impacts on other categories and markets and we are assessing the need for additional pricing moves. When opportunities allow, we will close couple of price increases with new product innovations, adding value for consumers along the way. We believe this is a temporary bottom-line rough patch to grow through, not a reason to reduce investment in the business and not a reason to redesign a strategy that has been working well before and during the COVID crisis. Our guidance ranges for fiscal 2022 incorporate these dynamics. We expect organic sales growth in the range of 2% to 4%. The high end of this range assumes global markets continue growing at about 3% or so and P&G continues to grow above market level. The low end of this range assumes deterioration in global markets to 2% or lower with P&G growth at or above underlying markets. This range also reflects the strong organic sales growth, more than 8%, that we delivered in the first half of fiscal 2021. Given this base period dynamic, we expect organic sales growth to be stronger in the back half of fiscal 2022 versus the front half. On the bottom-line, we expect core earnings per share growth in the range of 3% to 6%. This outlook includes headwinds of approximately $1.9 billion from \u2013 after-tax from commodity cost of freight, as I mentioned earlier, with a modest offset, overall, of $100 million after-tax from foreign exchange rate benefits. The combined impact of materials, freight and FX is approximately a $0.70 per share headwind to EPS or a 12%-point headwind to EPS growth in fiscal 2022. Considering the costs challenge is weighted heavily towards the front half of the year. Our earnings growth is expected to be much stronger in the back half of fiscal 2022. We are targeting adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% starting the year. We expect to pay over $8 billion in dividends and to repurchase between $7 billion and $9 billion of common stock; combined, a plan to return $15 billion to $17 billion of cash to shareowners this fiscal year. This outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Significant currency weakness, commodity cost increases, additional geopolitical disruption, major production stoppages or store closures are not anticipated within this guidance range. Now back to David for closing comments. David Taylor : Thanks, Andre. Our business exhibited strong momentum well before the COVID crisis. We strengthened our position further during the crisis, and we believe P&G is well-positioned to grow through and beyond the crisis. We will manage what is likely to be a volatile near term, consistent with the strategy we\u2019ve outlined many times and against the immediate priorities of ensuring employee health and safety, maximizing availability of our products to serve cleaning health and hygiene needs and helping society overcome the COVID challenges that still exists in many parts of the world. We\u2019ll continue to step forward toward our opportunities, not back. We remain committed to our strategies and fully invest in our business. We remain committed to driving productivity improvements to fund investment and to maintain balanced top and bottom-line growth over the long term. We\u2019re doing this in our interest, in society\u2019s interest and in the interest of our long-term shareowners. Now, we\u2019d be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to talk a little bit about marketing both in terms of the efficiencies you've been realizing over the last several years and sort of thought process on the amount of spending necessary kind of going forward. So, and also relevant to the succession plans announced last night. So, you've delivered $2 billion in media spending efficiencies over five years, right? And then marketing reinvestment this quarter was way stronger than we had expected. I think it was up 170 basis points on top of a 270-basis point investment last year. So, one, how much has really left to go for on that efficiency side of the equation? Two, as you think about incremental reinvestment, there's so much funding in the base from the past two years. How are you thinking about that for fiscal 2022? And then finally, I've been asked a few times over email, just CFO becoming a CEO, should the marketers be worried? I'd love to hear everyone's perspective. Thank you. David Taylor : Okay. Let me start with the last part first. And then Andre can hit some of that the marketing spending numbers. But first, no, the marketer should not be worried. The marketer should feel wonderful, and that we've got a senior leadership that is maintaining a high degree of consistency. And you all know Jon very, very well. He has supported these investments in media, to the extent they grow the market and grow market share and are helping drive awareness and trial of superior products and brands. That's a good thing. It's about creating value, not reducing or increasing one element of cost. And Jon has been very engaged with me and the leadership team in these decisions. The other thing about our organization structure, we leave it to the sector CEOs and the enterprise leader to decide how much to invest in their businesses. This is not a decision we make at the headquarters. It's a decision made by each one of the business leaders and we hold them accountable to create the top and bottom-line growth and cash generation for their business. And I think the results the last three years speaks in themselves. And so, they actually should feel very good as do I, that the leadership of the company and the organization structures working very well. And one comment on the marketing spending efficiency, then Andre can add some additional comment. We have increased meaningfully the investment in marketing. But we have also increased the rate of meaningful innovation that grows the market. So, one of the key parts is you have to help consumers understand what the product is, how to use it, and then help drive awareness and trial. And these investments have done that. It's evidenced and again, in the top line growth, you recall very well. If you go back four or five years ago, our average growth was about 2%. We moved up to the past four years. Past five years, we've averaged 4%. In the last three years 6%.  And we've got the strongest share growth we've seen in many years, which tells me the combination of the superiority strategy and the brand execution by our people is really working. And we'll continue to invest behind both brands that are winning and invest to make sure we get the trial. And Andre, any comments on the specific numbers? Andre Schulten : Look, I think we've increased our ad spending year-over-year in fiscal 2021 versus 2020 by $850 million. And as David said, superior communication is a core element of our superiority framework and we've not reached the point of diminishing return on those investments. So, we'll continue to invest at around that level in percent of sales. We also do believe that there is significant productivity improvements still within the media spend. When you think about shift into digital media improved targeting capability with first party audiences or third-party audiences and ability to sharpen our focus, even on TV audiences with our own data. So there continues to be a significant leverage in terms of direct media spend efficiencies that we can create to improve quantity of reach and quality of reach. In the indirect space, we also striving to continue to improve production costs agency structures. So you'll see us continue to work in that direction mostly to reinvest in superiority and superior communication. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Steve Powers : Great. Thanks. And good morning. And congrats to you both this morning Jon and David. It feels like the businesses being passed off with great momentum. So again, congrats to you both. I guess my question, I think, it's probably a question for Andre mostly. Andre, I think you said that China was up 5% in the quarter. I don't know if you provided a U.S. growth rate in the quarter. But if you have one that would be great. And I'm thinking the question really is that, as you said, both those businesses had very difficult comps in the year-ago quarter. Those difficult comparisons continue in the first half of 2022. So just in terms of the makeup of growth first half, second, half geographically is there anything to call out there? Do you feel like the U.S. can stay positive in the first half? Does anything to call it in terms of the context of growth via geography? Thank you. David Taylor : Yes, very good. So, U.S. quarter four growth was a minus 1%. If you look on the two-year stack basis, that's 18%. Last year's quarter four was 19% growth and the strong growth in last year's quarter was mainly driven about 13 points, I believe by restocking retail inventories after strong consumption. So, in comparison, minus one on a 19% base. The U.S. consumption I think we believe at this point in time, we'll return to normal levels. Most importantly, we see our shares at record levels in the U.S. Our brands are continuing to strive. We're gaining share across categories. Our retail partnerships are strong and we have very strong innovation programs hitting in the U.S. So, we remain confident, but I think you're rightfully cautious in terms of base period effects, especially in the first half. On the China side, we expect the market to continue to grow mid singles. Our mantra is to grow ahead of that. And I would tell you the same thing I told you for the U.S. We feel good about the strength of our brands. In China, we feel good about our go-to-market capabilities, and we'll continue to invest in innovation and supporting those innovations in the market. Same comment considering base period is going to be prudent for China and the entire focus markets environment. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : Hey guys. So just taking a step back now that we've got a full quarter in the books where you've cycled a period where COVID was unfortunately with us, and the leadership change going forward. I was just hoping you could review maybe some of the more enduring consumer changes that you see post-COVID, again from a consumer perspective and how you think P&G is positioned relative to those changes. And then, regarding the CEO change down the road, any sort of tweaks in strategy here or areas of just increased emphasis either in that post-COVID environment or with the change in leadership. Thanks. David Taylor : A couple of comments about the consumer changes that we think are endearing, and then certainly Andre and Jon can jump in with some comments as well. We do believe that the health cleaning and hygiene brands will continue to play an increased role. There's some statistics that I saw a while back that pre-pandemic about 5% of people work from home, and then post-pandemic estimated 20. I don't know what the number will be, but certainly there's a significant number of people that will be in home more than they were pre-pandemic. That bodes well for us. I believe the strength of our brands and actually the shift toward trusted brands will likely last a good while we've had meaningful, increased household penetration on some of our brands as there was a stock-up and then people got exposed to the superior performance. I think that will have a lingering, positive impact. So, you've got both more people at home, not take the U.S. especially, more occasions at home. You've got a shift toward trusted brands and the role that health plan and hygiene place will anniversary some tough comps, but the health of the brands and the share of momentum. And to me, it gives me a lot of confidence going forward. The U.S. and Europe, I call it our biggest focus markets are having some of the strongest share progress they've had in every one of those categories. And absolute share is higher than they were pre-pandemic with the exception of family care that had a supply issue for the first part and just couldn't supply because the increased demand and their growing share in the fourth quarter. So, we've got good momentum, consumers continue to vote for trusted superior performing brands. And that I think those consumer habit changes will likely last. Andre Schulten : What I'd say, maybe I think our portfolio positions us well. There were many categories that did not benefit from COVID tailwinds in our portfolio. When you think about adult incontinence, deodorants, shave care, some of the tooth whitening that we see coming back, Personal Health Care had a very low cough-cold season with everyone wearing masks and our professional business certainly that serves hotels and restaurants did not do well. So as mobility increases, those businesses pick up and we see that as a positive going forward obviously. Geographically, many of the markets we operate in specifically the enterprise markets never did see a benefit in terms of consumption from COVID as consumers and retailers were impacted by the crisis. So hopefully as these markets work through the pandemic, that will also provide a tailwind from a geographic standpoint. Jon Moeller : And relative to the question on strategic changes as we go forward, we will always be responsive to consumers and customers whose needs will continue to evolve over time. I don't foresee that leading to any major change in the strategies that the team has been executing with excellence. But again, we will continue to be very attentive to and responsive to consumer and customer needs. Dara Mohsenian : Great. Thanks. Operator : The next question will come from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citi. Wendy Nicholson : Hi. My first question, actually, David, sort of before you go. One of the categories that seems to sort of be, I don't want to say persistently weak, but kind of lagging in terms of sustained global market share improvements is baby care. And I know the last 12 months has been really funny. You've actually had some market share recovery, because they were depressed last year, given supply issues, but still just sort of in totality, Baby Care just looks to be such a competitive marketplace. I think Kimberly sounded more aggressive and more optimistic about their market share positions. You've obviously got lots of fragmentation in the category with more organic, all natural players, sort of trying to gain traction. So, can you kind of give us a state of the union on Baby Care in particular where you think Proctor is? Why you think there it's been sort of a stubborn business for you in terms of being able to really make progress, especially in China? That would be great. Thank you. David Taylor : Sure. Happy to. First, it has been a challenging category for several years. And as we were very open several years ago, it would take time because the technical changes we need to make to deliver product superiority. And we continue to make those changes, but I'm actually very encouraged by the progress they've made. Our focus markets grew top line and profits last year. All-in profits increased global Baby Care made progress. Our North America business especially was plus 3%. The highest has been in six years. We're leading the category growth. We actually have strong share growth now in North America, most recent period, it's up a point or more. Our superiority metric, which is really important, back several years ago, it was 25%, which is unacceptable. It's up to 60% rising and we'll continue to be investing to again, delight consumers. But with North America doing better. Europe returned to growth for the first time in six years. You're right. It's been challenging, both the birth rate, but returned to growth, expanded the margins, we addressed some of the challenges we had in our enterprise markets. Jon and his team did a great job there working to make sure we had structurally profitable businesses and adjusting the business model and supply systems where need be. So, you look across those. And then this shift toward fast growth segments. Our wipes business was up 10%. Our pants business was up 12%. We doubled our bed wetter segment growth to 12% behind the successful Ninjamas launched. So, there's a number of things going well. We still have much work to do. And we understand that. Baby Care does take time, but this was the best year we've had in six years and the trends are positive. We're now playing in fast-growing segments and the product superiority is getting better each year. So, I become more optimistic on Baby Care each year. I think the leader and their team are doing a really nice job recognizing that this is a mid to long-term game and they're continuing to make the right investments. Operator : Our next question will come from Javier Escalante with Evercore ISI. Javier Escalante : Hi, good morning, everyone. And congratulations to David and Jon from Robert and I well deserved. My question has to do with your plan to offset the increases in raw material the $1.9 billion hit. And if you could just split the pricing versus savings, how much you're going to need in terms of not taking pricing. How much is pricing and if you could help us understand what is happening geographically. We have a good feel of the U.S. We do not about Western Europe in particular and both two of their competitors, Colgate and Unilever reported negative pricing in Western Europe which is surprising. And I think that they were even talk about the inflation. So, if you can talk about pricing in general and what's leading this deflation, is the consumer, is the retailer, is competitive dynamic? Thank you. David Taylor : I'll give one quick comment and turn it to Andre. Javier, we have many tools to deal with the commodity cost increase. And one thing that is very clear is that hits everybody. That hits local brands, international brands equally in many ways more severely if you don't have scaled supply systems and the buying power that a company like P&G dash, where we work collaboratively with our suppliers. So, we've got the tools that include innovation, which I think is the strongest I've seen it in years. We have certainly pricing, but we have a very active productivity program. So, we've got the tools. If you get into specifics for Europe and others, I'm going to turn it to Andre to get into. But again, I think we're well positioned to deal with it, and we have our eyes wide open that it's going to be meaningful. And especially in some of the categories that have some of the increased amounts of raw materials that have been hit the most. Andre, you want to give any specific comments about Europe? Andre Schulten : What I would say is similar to what David mentioned, I think productivity is going to be a core driver of the offsets that we will continue to focus on. The commodity pressures that we're seeing as you have heard broad based in the industry and therefore the same pressures exist in the market around the world. In terms of pricing, we've mentioned that we've taken and announced pricing in Central and Eastern European markets. We've announced pricing in the U.S., which you referenced, and we've also have taken pricing and cumulatively high single digits in Latin America over the past 12 months. We will continue to evaluate pricing opportunities around the world. And we are encouraged, I think by our ability to execute pricing in the markets where we have announced. But I cannot comment on any additional pricing that we might or might not take again, that is within the discretion of the sector leaders. And we'll come out as we see fit. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : Great, thanks. Good morning, everyone. And congratulations to David and Jon. Broader portfolio question, just to kind of pull back a little bit. So really beyond fiscal 2022, and it relates specifically around strategic priorities and where you see the greatest opportunities to accelerate profitable growth. So, Jon understanding your comments that the strategies indeed working. This is just going to be sort of a continuation and execution against that. And David, you talked about what the company has done with respect to productivity structure, culture innovation. And I think, there's sort of general recognition among the investment community. You look at the market share momentum and the results. It is a strategy that's clearly working, but that being said, as you look across your geographies, your categories and your cost structure, I would like to get your perspective on the areas where you see the greatest opportunity to accelerate growth and maximize profitability. And Jon, how you intend to prioritize those? Thank you. David Taylor : Yes, I'll give comment now and I'll turn it to Jon. First, there are many opportunities, but it starts right here in the U.S. It's our largest market. We have \u2013 we declared several years ago, the U.S. is a growth market. We don't have any markets that aren't growth markets. It's our job to create the innovation that drives the growth. And I think it's best illustrated by the U.S. We are averaging 1% to 2% and we've moved to mid singles. And certainly, the last two years, we've been in high singles and it has driven by the innovation and the communication, just the superiority strategy being brought to health and executed in a very good way. We have had some bolt-on acquisitions that you're well aware of. There've been some categories that we've been open about. We added the Merck international business to our health care, and that's done very well. And you've seen the growth recently in our healthcare business. That remains an interesting segment. You've seen some bolt-on acquisitions in the beauty care business. Again, that remains an interesting business as well. And each of the sector leaders has the opportunity to evaluate whether they see bolt-on acquisitions or acquisitions that would be helpful. The core though is most important, driving the core and the focus markets, and then continuing to have smart growth and value creations in the enterprise markets is working. And I believe that's the right strategy. I'll turn it to Jon to offer any comments about how he's thinking about the future. But we've worked together on these and been aligned that it starts with delivering the core and seeing market growth is a key responsibility of each category. Jon Moeller : Kevin, I really like, when you've heard me talk about this before each of the categories that we've decided to play in, as we've focused on strengthened our portfolio. And I firmly believe that they all have opportunity to grow and to create value. And you're seeing that, and the results that Andre described, for example, there's very broad progress that's occurring across those businesses. Similarly, from a geographic standpoint, what people would view as mature markets have significant growth potential that exists within them. You've seen the results in the U.S. If you look at category development outside of the U.S., on average is 20% of U.S. levels. So, there's significant opportunity across geographies to continue to develop these categories to grow markets and increased consumption. And historically, while we probably felt that way for the focus markets, we were a little bit concerned about what kind of future the enterprise markets held for us. But the team there has made significant progress in the last couple of years in dramatically increasing the structural profitability of those businesses. So, they are investment grade, and we can take advantage of the population on income growth that will occur in those markets and do so in a very profitable value accretive way. We exited last year with one country well over 100 countries and the enterprise markets losing any money. So, the majority are contributing positively to the company's topline and bottom line. So, I don't want to in any way backhand the question. But I really do believe that we have opportunities for growth and value creation in each of our categories and broadly across the global geography. And then it becomes executing the strategy that we've all talked about a number of times, and that as Andre mentioned, we will continue to double down on stepping forward, not back. Operator : Your next question will be from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark Astrachan : Thanks. And morning everybody. Wanted to ask about thoughts on sustainability of EBIT margin expansion that we've seen in recent years. I get the comments about the roughly three points or so if my math is right of input commodity cost headwinds for 2022. So, I guess, broader picture 2021 sounds like you are saying that's a base. You think you can obviously expand over time in a normalized world. I guess, maybe you could just talk a bit about how holistically you are thinking about that. And then maybe drilling in a little bit as well, looking at segments most of the \u2013 where the strongest rate of expansion has come from household products, whether it's a household care, or a fabric or baby, et cetera. So how sustainable is that? What can you do there to further improve? And just, as I said, broadly, kind of, how are you thinking about margins? Thank you. Andre Schulten : So, I think, as David explained and Jon explained we are very pleased with the categories we\u2019re operating in. I think they all offer continued growth opportunity. If you think about either growing the market via innovation with the examples that David mentioned earlier, if you think about trading consumers up into premium propositions will have superior profitability in terms of penny profit for us. If you, for example, liquid fabric enhancers, household penetration in the U.S. is only 37% and only 52% of those households use fabric enhancer with every load. So, there's tons of runway. When you think about beats [ph], those numbers are even lower. Those propositions accretive to all portfolio, are accretive to all margins and we\u2019ll continue to focus on those. And they provide a good source for future growth, both top and bottom line. Productivity is another key lever that still has enormous runway across the balance sheet and across the P&L. Our supply chain continues to have significant opportunity in terms of synchronization. But also, every innovation that we bring basically creates a new cost S curve that we can then optimize from. We talked about media and advertising spend as a significant source of future profitability, growth and productivity. And I would add, go-to-market specifically in terms of go-to-market logistics, but also go-to-market spend as a source So, we feel confident in our ability to deliver, even with cost headwinds, which is reflected in our guidance for next year. And we do believe there's enough leavers in the portfolio from trade up, to usage expansion, to be able to continue to do so. David Taylor : Some of you have heard me talk about this before, but there is a chart that I share with our leadership team whenever we're together. That highlights the importance of growth on both the topline and margin, and delivering top third, total shareholder return. We need to do both to dependably deliver a top third shareholder return over reasonable periods of time. So that will continue to be the focus and the emphasis. Having said that, margin as a metric, has many issues associated with it. The first being, I can't put margin in a bank, I can't return margin to share owners. What matters most is what Andre referred to, which is penny profit and overall profit and profitability. And we've got to make sure that we keep our eyes firmly on that as we work to grow the topline. Operator : Next question will come from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : Good morning. And congrats to all of you in particular, David. And thanks for your leadership. And congrats to Jon and Chevalier. I have a question on the Beauty and follow-up on Baby Care. What are you expecting for fiscal 2022 in terms of recovering skincare in Japan and China for both SK-II and Olay? And for baby, David, your comments of improvement most recently, are you putting a question now for John more money behind innovation this fall here's to because Pampers Pure was a good launch but it seems that core Pampers is still lagging? And a clarification on the $1.9 billion headwind for fiscal 2022, are you embedding that commodities and transportation costs will be stabilize, or decline, or have you conservatively assumed that these cost pressures will linger at ground levels, given understandably wide EPS range that you gave? David Taylor : Let me start with a couple of those. There are quite a few questions there. So, you have to help me if we don't answer each one. First, you mentioned a Beauty business and specifically SK-II. I'm very pleased if I just take SK-II as an example, you would have expected it to get hit very, very hard because of travel retail, virtually stopping in Asia. And it's certainly a huge channel. But the team pivoted amazingly well and was able to actually grow the business last year, the business was up double digits up 13%. So, SK-II is actually healthy and continues to run nicely because the consumption that did not happen in travel retail happened in the home market. And then there was the duty-free area in Heinemann province, they did a really nice job, making sure that the brand was both available and had the innovation and communication to win. So, SK-II is healthy, and I expect \u2013 I don't know when travel retail will resume, you can take your guess, it looks like it's going to be a while. But the good news is at the strong growth that we're seeing already, we're not dependent on that. It could be a help if and when it opens up anytime soon. More broadly the Skin and Personal Care business had a strong year last year as to the overall beauty business. So, again I feel very good about the business. How strong it grows next year will be dependent again on many of the factors that we've already mentioned. While there's meaningful cost headwinds, the innovation that both Hair Care, Skin and Personal Care has launched and will be launching I feel very good about. So, both businesses had strong years on the top and bottom line, and I feel good about those. Baby Care, I made a number of comments earlier, so I'm not sure what else would be helpful. Yes, we are very committed to the category. The innovation coming, and will continue to come. We are on the multi-year innovation program. Certainly, part of it has hit the market and you see that improvement in percent superiority from 25% to 60%. We will continue to work to move that up significantly. And we also recognize that for many consumers in the mini markets, the premiumization is critically important in these high growth areas. And that allows us to offset some of the challenges that you're well aware of on the birthright. And still grow the category, and grow share, and create value. And Baby Care did create value this year. It's a very strong year, strong improvement. So, all these businesses to me have meaningful upside. And especially the Beauty business has very good momentum and Baby Care is accelerating. So, I feel good about both. Jon Moeller : And Andrea, to answer your question on the commodity exposure and freight exposure, we are forecasting a spot. So, we assume spot prices will sustain throughout the year. So, we don't expect an easing of these commodity pressures within the guidance that we've given. Operator : Okay. Next question will be from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Chris Carey : Hi, good morning. So just two specific questions. I'll keep it brief. So, just on Grooming, volume is up for the first time in a while on a fiscal year, pricing as well. Have we turned the corner in the business? I'm also conscious there could be some cyclical recovery with return to office. Any perspective on just where you think the business sits on this recovery curve, and if that's by geography or priced here? Any perspective would be helpful. And then just one quick follow-up on SK-II, I noticed that in the press release talks about in pricing premiumization, but not volume. Is it safe to assume, it's been more driven by price of late and not volume? So, any clarification there would be helpful? Thanks so much. David Taylor : It's actually very balanced volume and pricing. But let me take one and then we can give the specific numbers. First, on Grooming, Grooming had a very strong year. They grew mid-single digits on the top and double digit on the bottom. Importantly, they grew share almost every segment across whether it was male shaved, female shave, appliance, all of those making very good progress, which contributed to the strong growth. And as you rightfully said, as people return to working outside the home, I think that will benefit the category. And what the team has done, which I think is very strong and very important going for the future, we're no longer a wet shave business. We're truly a Grooming business, with growth in wet shave, dry shave, which we call appliances. We're also growing in many of the new areas, like IPL, the intense pulsed light area, all of those to me, give me confidence and these new segments as well. We have innovation come on King C. Gillette, which helps people with facial hair. So, it's a broader portfolio, innovation across all those different forms and segments. And it's leading to mid singles top and double-digit bottom. So that's the strongest year we've had in many, many years in Grooming. And the reason is strong, should continue because it's innovation-driven, consumer-driven. Jon Moeller : And on SK-II, what David said is certainly right. Growth is very strong 13% as David mentioned for the fiscal year, but 35% for quarter four. The pricing taken was mid-single. So, by far there is a significant volume component to it as the team shifted consumption into high non, which is a big part of the offset to travel retail reduction. So again, growth on SK-II is both volume and price mix driven. Operator : Your next question will be from the line of Peter Grom with UBS. Peter Grom : Hey, good morning, everyone. And David and John, I want to offer my congratulations as well. So, I guess I just wanted to ask about the business momentum and growth from here. And I mean the quarterly performance, and what we can see in the data is very impressive. So, congrats on that. And I know the health of the brand is very strong. But when you think about the magnitude of growth versus your peers, I mean, do you expect this level of out-performance to continue? I mean you mentioned record share like how much more room do you have on the share side, because a lot of your competitors are really implementing a similar playbook in attempting to innovate with superiority as well? So just like any comments on the relative out-performance from here would be really helpful. Thanks. David Taylor : I won't speculate too much on the relative out performance. What I can say is the strength of just what you said, the brands are strong and the measures we use, which I think are really important, our superiority metrics are relative to the best competitor in each brand, in each country. So, it pushes us to maintain and try to extend the advantage we have. Now we have full respect for our competitors. And you're right we have very strong growth in both North America, Europe, and Latin America. And in those markets that we'll see what happens next year. But if this share of growth has been now sustained in North America for three years and in Europe for three years. So, the focus markets are performing very well. And as John mentioned, we have very strong progress in the enterprise markets. We are mid singles with double digit growth in a very, very difficult environment. So that gives me confidence. We're at least well positioned. But the other thing is very real, you have to earn it every day. And so, our teams understand that our competitors are refocusing and those that lost share will come back with their innovations and investments. And it's our job to go earn it. But it's very clear that's what they're accountable to deliver. And based on the last three years, I've got confidence that we\u2019ll continue. Jon Moeller : And just a reminder, excuse me. How you gain, share how we gained, share is very important in the answer to this question. And Dave has talked many times in our discussion this morning as is Andre about our intent to be a disproportionate driver of market growth. The math that falls out of that create share growth. But the notion that we're taking business from competitors, and it's only a matter of time and that that's not how we look at things. Our job is to be constantly expanding the pie, constantly expanding the number of households that we serve. And if we do that well, there's no reason that growth shouldn't be sustainable. Operator : All right, we\u2019ll next, go to Bill Chappell with Truist Securities. Bill Chappell : Thanks. Good morning. I'm not one who typically says congratulations on these types of calls. But I just want to take a step David the retirement couldn't be more deserved. Looking back six years ago in terms of where the company was, and especially where investor sentiment was, it's been remarkable that where we are today. And knowing you for decade plus and how integral you've been in kind of the turnaround. I mean, you are, I think most people would agree on the call, Mr. P&G. So, so well-deserved. And I applaud the Board and everyone for making these changes, because I think it's just well done. So, with that moving on to the actual question, kind of on trade promotion, as we look back with pandemics trade promotion dropped off, it's not coming back kind of to full extent as you would expect as you are taking pricing and what have you. And just kind of want to understand if you think this is kind of a permanent change, if we've kind of made a shift back to where marketing and innovation really take the lead in terms of investment dollars and trade promotion never really kind of goes back to where it was pre-pandemic levels, or if you do see it starting to creep back into pre-pandemic levels. Any thoughts there would be appreciated. Thank you. David Taylor : So, I just offer a couple of thoughts. First, thank you for the kind words. The organization deserves a ton of credit and the total leadership team. But I appreciate your comments on me and very much agreeing to comments on John. In terms of trade promotion, certainly it's in our best interest to bring to our retail partners programs that build their business and build their margin. I do believe, as you said, that that can best be done by innovation and market growing plans. And there's walls they play with us and making sort of things like the shelf, but a virtual or physical shelf is arranged in a way that creates market growth and helps consumers find the brands that they're most apt to use. We worked with retail partners around the world. And the ones we've partnered with best success is they grow the market, grows, the margin grows and that we helped them do it, we get rewarded. So, we will continue with that certainly objective. Certainly, our eyes are wide open. I expect from a very low base, we will see an increase in trade spending. Do I believe it to go all the way back to what it was before? I think many retailers are very interested in finding smart ways and they have the same pressures that we do with the commodity costs, they need as well as we to find ways to create value. So, I'm hopeful that we'll see some thoughtful change in promotion strategy that is more value creating for the market. Jon Moeller : Yes. And then to add a few numbers to David's statements quarter four in the U.S. we saw trade promotions, volumes sold on deals back to 27%, which was in line with quarter three, but it's still below pre-pandemic levels, which was around 33%. So, we're certainly getting back to a more normalized level in quarter four. Operator : All right. And your final question will come from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge. Jonathan Feeney : Thanks very much. And let me add my congratulations, David, Jon known better. A quick one, and then a little bit more involved one please. The quick one, does the point guidance you gave us on cost headwinds and ForEx benefits, does that include hedging current or anticipated? And then the second, maybe a little more in follow-up one is we've had a lot of discussions with consumer staples leaders in the past really two weeks about the state of retailer inventory. And that's largely a U.S. question, but it seems all over the Board, a lot of retailers are seeing better foot traffic, certain retailers, certain channels have had unprecedented volume that's stuck around. And there is a little bit of a mentality of maybe taking on more inventory and shipping, maybe not matching up with measured takeaway, not only in the U.S. but other places. And I think it cuts both ways. So, I know there's a lot to that question, but anything you could say about retailer inventories, where you think that is, and you have to say your big markets, say your focused markets where you stand and how that plays into your guidance for 2022? What are your thoughts about that, how that plays in? I'd appreciate it. Thank you. David Taylor : So, I'll let Andre comments on the hedging question just a second. The way I think about the retailers\u2019 approach to their business, I don't really think about it through an inventory lens so much as I think about it through a desire to maintain dependability of supply. And those manufacturers that can offer that assurance are often being rewarded with increased shelf space and increased focus on the part of our retail partners. There's a small amount of inventory bill, but that's not really the focus. The focus is on how do we ensure supply and maintain the satisfaction of our shoppers. And that's a very fertile place for us to apply. With regard to hedging Andre. Andre Schulten : So, yes, the short answers that $1.9 billion that we've communicated is the net impact to P&G. John Chevalier : Good, thank you very much. I think that concludes the call. We very much appreciate your engagement. P&G has got strong momentum. We've got a strong leadership, leadership team and organization, and we will continue to work aggressively to deliver strong results and value for our shareholders. Thank you all for your support and your comments today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

This discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from these projections. As required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the Company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business trends and has posted on its Investor Relations website, www.pginvestor.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Now, I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer, Andre Schulten. Andre Schulten : Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Jon Moeller, currently Vice Chair and incoming President and Chief Executive Officer as of November 1st; and John Chevalier, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. We're going to keep our prepared remarks brief and then turn straight to your questions. The July to September quarter provides a good start to the fiscal year, putting us on track to deliver our guidance for organic sales growth, core EPS growth, free cash flow productivity, and cash return to share owners. We experienced the full impact of rising commodity and transportation costs this quarter, but healthy top line growth and strong cost savings kept EPS growth nearly in line with prior year. Earnings growth should improve sequentially through the balance of the fiscal year as price increases go into effect and productivity programs ramp up. So moving to first quarter results, organic sales grew 4%, volume contributed 2 points of sales growth, pricing, and mix each added 1 point. Growth was broad-based across business units with nine out of 10 product categories growing organic sales. Personal Healthcare, up double digits; Fabric Care grew high singles; Baby Care, Feminine Care and Grooming, up mid singles; Home Care, Oral Care, Hair Care, and Skin and Personal Care organic sales each up low single digits. Family Care declined mid singles, comping very strong growth in the base period. Organic sales were up 4% in the U.S., despite 16% growth in the base period. On a two-year stack basis, U.S. organic sales are up 20%. Greater China organic sales were in line with prior year due to strong growth in the base period comp and due to intra-quarter softness and beauty market growth. On a two-year stack basis, organic China organic sales are up 12% in line to slightly ahead of underlying market growth. Focused markets grew 4% for the quarter and enterprise markets were up 5%. E-commerce sales grew 16% versus prior year. Global aggregate market share increased 50 basis points, 36 of our top 50 category country combinations held or grew share for the quarter. Our superiority strategy continues to drive strong market growth and in term share growth for P&G. All channel market value sales in the U.S. categories in which we compete grew mid-single digits this quarter and P&G value share continued to grow to over 34%. We are up more than a 1.5 versus first quarter last year. Importantly, the share growth is broad-based; 9 of 10 product categories grew share over the past three months with the 10th improving to flat versus year-ago over the past one month. Consumers are continuing to prefer P&G brands. On the bottom line, core earnings per share were $1.61, down 1% versus the prior year. On a currency neutral basis, core EPS declined 3%, mainly due to gross margin pressure from higher input costs, which we highlighted in our initial outlook for the year. Core gross margin decreased 370 basis points and currency neutral core gross margin was down 390 basis points. Higher commodity and freight cost impacts combined were 400 basis point hit to gross margins. Mix was an 80 basis points headwind, primarily due to geographic impacts. Productivity, savings, pricing, and foreign exchange provided a partial offset to the gross margin headwinds. Within SG&A, marketing expense as a percentage of sales was in line with prior year level for the quarter, increasing more than 5% in absolute dollars consistent with all-in sales growth. Core operating margin decreased 260 basis points, currency neutral core operating margin declined 270 basis points. Productivity improvements were 180 basis points help to the quarter. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 92%. We returned nearly $5 billion of cash to shareowners, $2.2 billion in dividends and approximately $2.8 billion in share repurchase. In summary, in the context of a very challenging cost environment, good results across top line, bottom line, and cash to start the fiscal year. Our team continues to operate with excellence and stay focused on the near-term priorities and long-term strategies that enabled us to create strong momentum prior to the COVID crisis and to make our business even stronger since the crisis began. We continue to step forward into these challenges and to double down our efforts to delight consumers. As we continue to manage through this crisis, we remain focused on the three priorities that have been guiding our near-term actions and choices. First, is ensuring the health and safety of our P&G colleagues around the world. Second, maximizing the availability of our products to help people and their families with a cleaning, health and hygiene needs. Third priority, supporting the communities, relief agencies, and people who are on the frontlines of this global pandemic. The strategic choices we've made are the foundation for balanced top and bottom line growth and value creation. A portfolio of daily used products, many providing cleaning, health, and hygiene benefits and categories where performance plays a significant role in brand choice. In these performance-driven categories, we've raised the bar on all aspects of superiority, product, package, brand communication, retail execution, and value. Superior offerings delivered with superior execution, drive market growth. In our categories, this drives value creation for our retail partners and builds market share for P&G brands. We've made investments to strengthen the health and competitiveness of our brands, and we'll continue to invest to extend our margin of advantage and quality of execution, improving solutions for consumers around the world. The strategic need for investment to continue to strengthen the superiority of our brands, the short-term need to manage through this challenging cost environment, and the ongoing need to drive balanced top and bottom line growth, including margin extension, underscore the importance of ongoing productivity. We're driving cost savings and cash productivity in all facets of our business; no area of cost is left untouched. Each business is driving productivity within their P&L and balance sheet to support balanced top and bottom line growth and strong cash generation. Success in our highly competitive industry requires agility that comes with the mindset of constructive disruption, a willingness to change, adapt and to create new trends of technology that will shape the industry for the future. In the current environment, that agility and constructive disruption mindset are even more important. Our organization structure yields a more empowered, agile and accountable organization with little overlap or redundancy, flowing to new demands, seamlessly supporting each other to deliver against our priorities around the world. These strategic choices on portfolio, superiority, productivity, constructive disruption, and organization structure and culture are not independent strategies, they reinforce and build on each other. When executed well, they grow markets, which in turn grow share, sales, and profit. These strategies were delivering strong results before the crisis and have served us well during the volatile times. We're confident they remain the right strategy framework as we move through and beyond the crisis. Moving onto guidance. We will undoubtedly experience more volatility as we move through this fiscal year. As we saw this quarter, growth results going forward will be heavily influenced by base period effects, along with the realities of currency and cost pressures and continued effects of the global pandemic. Supply chains are under pressure from tight labor markets, tight transportation markets, and overall capacity constraints. Inflationary pressures are broad-based and sustained. Foreign exchange rates add more volatility to this mix. We have also experienced some short-term disruptions in materials availability in several regions around the world. Our purchasing R&D and logistics experts have done a great job managing these challenges. These costs and operational challenges are not unique to P&G, and we won't be immune to the impacts. However, we think the strategies we've chosen, the investments we've made, and the focus on executional excellence have positioned us well to manage through this volatility over time. Input costs have continued to rise since we gave our initial outlook for the year in late July. Based on current spot prices, we now estimate a $2.1 billion after-tax commodity cost headwind in fiscal 2022. Fiscal costs have -- freight costs have also continued to increase. We now expect freight and transportation costs to be an incremental $200 million after-tax headwind in fiscal '22. We will offset a portion of this higher cost with price increases and with productivity savings. As discussed last quarter and in the more recent investor conferences, we've announced price increases in the U.S. on portions of our Baby Care, Feminine Care, Adult Incontinence, Family Care, Home Care, and Fabric Care businesses. In the last few weeks, we've also announced to retailers in the U.S. that we will increase prices on segments of our Grooming, Skin Care, and Oral Care businesses. The degree of timing of these moves are very specific to the category, brand, and sometimes the product form within a brand. This is not a one-size-fits-all approach. We're also taking pricing in many markets outside the U.S. to offset commodity, freight and foreign exchange impact. As always, we will look to close a couple of price increases with new product innovations, adding value for consumers along the way. As we've said before, we believe this is a temporary bottom line rough patch to grow through, not a reason to reduce investment in the business. We're sticking with the strategy that has been working well before and during the COVID crisis. I will go First Quarter results confirm our guidance ranges for the Fiscal year across all key metrics. We continue to expect organic sales growth in the range of 2% to 4%. Our solid start to the Fiscal year increases our confidence in the upper half of this range. We expect pricing to be a larger contributor to sales growth in coming quarters as more of our price increases become effective in the market. As this pricing reach store shelves, we'll be closely monitoring consumption trends. While it's still early in the pricing cycle, we haven't seen notable changes in consumer behavior. On the bottom line, we're maintaining our outlook of core earnings per share growth in the range of 3% to 6%, despite the increased cost challenges we're facing. Foreign exchange is now expected to be neutral to after-tax earnings compared to the modest tailwind we estimated at the start of the year. Considering FX was a modest help to first quarter earnings, we're projecting it to be a headwind for the balance of the year. In total, our revised outlook for the impact of materials, freight, and foreign exchange is now a $2.3 billion after-tax headwind for Fiscal '22 earnings, or roughly $0.90 per share, a 16% point headwind to core EPS growth. This is $500 million after-tax of incremental cost pressure versus our initial outlook for the year. Despite these cost challenges, we are committed to maintaining strong investment in our brands. So while we are not changing our core EPS guidance range, please take note of these dynamics as you update your outlook for the year. Will face the most significant cost impacts in the first half of the Fiscal year as pricing goes into effect, as savings programs ramp up, and as we begin to annualize the initial spike and input costs, earnings growth should be sequentially stronger in the third and fourth quarters of the year. We are targeting adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90%. We expect to pay over $8 billion in dividends and to repurchase $7 billion to $9 billion of common stock. Combined a plan to return $15 billion to $17 billion of cash to share owners this fiscal. This outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates, commodity prices, and foreign exchange rates. Significant currency weakness, commodity cost increases, additional geopolitical disruptions, major production stoppages or store closures are not anticipated within the guidance ranges. To conclude, our business exhibited strong momentum well before the COVID crisis. We've strengthened our position further during the crisis and we believe P&G is well-positioned to grow beyond the crisis. We will manage through the near-term cost pressures and continued market level volatility with the strategy we've outlined many times, and against the immediate priorities on ensuring employee health and safety, maximizing availability of our products, and helping society overcome the COVID challenges that still exist in many parts of the world. Will continue to step forward toward our opportunities, and we remain fully invested in our business. We remain committed to driving productivity improvements to fund growth investments, mitigate input cost challenges, and to maintain balanced top and bottom-line growth. With that, we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Steve Powers : Yes. Hey, guys. Good morning, everybody. Maybe we can start just on organic growth this quarter and how you view it relative to underlying consumption trends. Specifically, how much of the 4% you think might have been aided by any timing, whether shipment timing or any temporary surges in demand against the backdrop of COVID? I guess it feels to me like maybe U.S. benefited from some of those dynamics and maybe China on the other side of that, but I'd love your perspective and just whether we should be thinking about any adverse correction against the 4% in subsequent quarters. Thanks. Andre Schulten : Yes. Thank you, Steve. I'll start by saying that overall consumption trends remain strong globally, particularly as you said in the U.S. Markets continue to grow within our categories of daily use, health and hygiene in the range of mid singles. So from a consumption standpoint, consumer behavior continues to elevate the importance of health hygiene and a clean home. More time at home certainly is also a factor. We continue to see elevated consumption on bounty paper towels, for example, by 10%. Charmin bath tissue is still elevated, consuming about 5% with more time at home. So overall consumption trends remained strong and fuel most of the growth. We also have been able to grow share as we've outlined in our prepared remarks. Also, on a global basis, we're up 50 basis points over the past three months and 70 basis points over the past six months. So that's certainly contributing to a stronger position to benefit from that growth. In the U.S., we've reached record share of 34.4% of value share up more than a point. Inventory effects, I would tell you, certainly play a role in some geographies. Mainly in China, we saw some inventory build in the base period, which the reverse is obviously happening in this period. But in the grand scheme of things, they don't really impact our consumption trends and our shipment trends in the quarter. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Why don't we pick up I guess on gross margin, which is obviously really challenged in the quarter for reasons that we know around commodities, freight, broader supply chain issues. So maybe we could just start with your hedge position for commodities, the visibility that you have at this point on the guidance, which is more dire on that front. And then, just broader views as best you can share. I don't know if -- around the supply chain issues, overall expectation in terms of how long these challenges are going to remain a headwind, and just how you're thinking about the cadence of gross margin restoration as you sort of try to get back to low 50% gross margin, I think that would be helpful. Thank you. Andre Schulten : Thanks, Kevin. So maybe let me start with the current outlook for commodities. The increases that we are seeing are broad-based across commodity classes. Our forecast is based on spot rates. We are assuming that the spot rates sustain. So all of our productivity programs, all of our pricing programs, all of our innovation programs are based on the assumption that current spot rates, as reflected in the current guidance, will sustain. We do not hedge commodities per se, so the position that you see here is the position as it impacts our P&L. We offset within our natural hedging position within foreign exchange rate, commodity basket and interest rates. That's the best way for us to protect against volatility and the most cost-effective way to protect against volatility. In terms of supply chain dynamics, certainly demand and supply have not balanced globally as we can see. We continue to see pressure on transportation and warehousing. We continue to see driver shortages, diesel increases. And as I mentioned before, across our commodity classes whether it's chemicals, resins, packaging, or pulp, these increases that we've seen as reflected in the current guidance reflects the existing market dynamics. So the best forecast we have is current spot, and that's what we're going to continue to operate against. We will -- as we articulated, I think before and want to reemphasize in this call as well, we will recover these costs over time. We will not sacrifice investment in the business as we do so. So strong productivity programs that are ramping up throughout the fiscal year. Pricing with innovation that we are bringing into the market if we can to improve value at the same time as we take pricing, All straight commodity pricing throughout the year will ease the margin pressures over time. But it will take time to recover the costs and we will intentionally take our time to recover the cost to protect investment in our superiority strategy, which is working well to drive our top line growth and overall balanced growth model. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : Hey guys. So just was looking for a bit more detail on pricing. Can you help us dimensionalize what percent of that portfolio will have pricing plans in place, post the plan pricing you mentioned earlier in a few categories, some cents for the magnitude of pricing. And then I know you're probably not going to want to be too specific on the go-forward, but just any insight on conceptually how you think about implementing pricing offset cost pressures. Is there some point this fiscal year when you think you'll catch up with the dollar cost pressure you're seeing year-over-year with dollar pricing, whether it be Q3 or Q4? Is that unrealistic, just given the magnitude of cost pressures? And then the last point, just where you've taken pricing so far. It sounds like you haven't seen much demand impact. Maybe you can elaborate on that a bit and talk about the risks that -- to market share momentum as you take pricing and how you guys think about that? Thanks. Andre Schulten : Yeah. Look, we're taking pricing around the globe and it's really a decision that has taken market-by-market, category-by-category and many cases SKU by SKU, depending on the situation in the market. So broad-based statements are difficult, so let me try to maybe focus on the U.S. here as a good example, and all biggest market. We have now announced pricing in nine out of 10 categories, so very broad-based. Many of these price increases are being implemented -- have been implemented in September or are being implemented over the next, call it, 90 days. You've seen the price increases. We've announced across Baby, Feminine Care, Family Care, they are mid singles. I would expect, even though the price increases on Grooming, Skin Care have just been out and they are different by few -- about the same range. Mid-singles is about the range that I would expect, again, out on the majority of our portfolio at this point. I cannot comment on future price increases, but we'll continue to evolve as the situation evolves in terms of cost and in terms of ability to take more pricing. In terms of recovery of cost, we expect, as we said in our prepared remarks, that the margin situation and the comp situation on core EPS was sequentially improved throughout the fiscal year. We will annualize part of the commodity cost increase starting with Q3. Most of the pricing will also take effect and actually flow through to the bottom line as of Q3. And our productivity programs will significantly ramp up throughout the fiscal year. All of that said, hard to predict exactly what we're going to lend about sequential progress. It's certainly what we are striving for. Most important point, as I said before, we will not reduce investment in the business. We continue to drive marketing spend, we continue to drive investment and superiority to sustain our balanced growth strategy for the mid and long term. Very early to read anything in terms of price elasticity. I will tell you for those price increases that have gone into the market in the U.S., most of them became effective middle of September and we have not seen any material reaction from consumers in terms of volume offtake. So that makes us feel good about our relative position. And obviously, we feel that we should be in a favorable position given the strength of our portfolio. We're going into this pricing round with 75% of our portfolio truly superior. Probably 80% by the time multi-piece pricing thesis hit. And that should give us a relatively strong position with consumers to deliver value in their mind even as we take pricing. Jon Moeller : Let me just build on Andre's comments with a couple big picture thoughts. Given the inflationary cycle that we're in, how do you want to be positioned? You want to have -- first of all, being in categories that are daily use that are focused -- where performance drives brand choice is a good place to be. Consumers through the pandemic have shifted their consumption in those categories towards trusted performing brands. And you see that even in what's happening with private label market shares, as an example, down in the U.S. over the past 3 months, down in Europe over the same periods of time. None of that is a guarantee for the future but you start in a very good position with a strong superiority profile as Andre has said, and a strong innovation program and investment program to continue that work. Number 2, you want to be dependable. And just one more thing to add to number 1, this is essentially part and parcel of our business model. Sometimes the reaction is -- this -- with this pricing is a new dynamic. Pricing has been a positive contributor to our top line for 44 out of 47 for the last quarters, and 16 of the last 17 years. Again, no guarantee for the future but we start with a business model that fundamentally supports pricing in a way that is value accretive to consumers. Second, you want to be in a position to minimize the need for pricing through productivity. We're in a better position on that regard than we've ever been. This organization has done a tremendous job, reducing costs and we'll continue to do so. We want to be in a position where you have product available at different price points to appeal to consumers for whom price is a bigger part of their personal value equation. We're in much better position there than we were in the last cycle. So again, none of that is any guarantee for the future, but all of that positions us much better than we've been historically. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to talk a little bit about how scale may or may not be benefiting P&G at this time versus what you see from peers, in comparison around the world. So just thinking about access to raw materials, to packaging inputs, ability to get energy and power in some countries. But I was just curious if you could talk a little bit again about availability, access to can puts in energy and how you think P&G is managing through this or will manage through this versus what you see from some other companies out there. Thanks. Andre Schulten : Yes. Thanks, Lauren. We are certainly not immune to the stress that is put on the supply chains globally. And we are very thankful to our supply chain teams who have done a tremendous job in developing business continuity plans and executing against those business continuity plans over the past 18 months, 24 months, as supply-chains were stressed throughout the COVID pandemic. The strength of our supply chains is mainly driven by the flexibility that we can create within those supply chains. So strong supplier partnerships around the globe allow us to shift sourcing if we need to from one supplier to another either because of supply not being available or freight lanes not being available to get materials from point A to B. It also allows us to optimize costs to a degree. And we've been doing that over the past few months and we'll continue to do so. We have an ability to reformulate some of our products which we're doing actively without impacting the superiority of the product or any noticeable impact to the consumer. And that gives us flexibility to adjust again to material availability or cost. We also have an organization that looks around the corner, anticipates potential bottlenecks, and then chooses to build inventory. It's either on materials and intermediates or unfinished products to then be able to withdraw from those inventories on a global basis. So it doesn't mean that we build inventory in the same region where we consume, but we have the ability to do that on a global basis. So in that sense, the global footprint is an advantage to us. As I said, we're not immune to any impact here. But if history is any indication of the future, we feel relatively well-positioned because of the strength of our organization here. Of course, if there are any major disruptions to supply chains, we would be exposed just like everyone else. In terms of energy availability, we'll acknowledge that we've obviously been part of some of those curtailments that we've seen in China, for example. But they've not had a material effect of our supply chains. Again, when you think about our ability to potentially source from other regions for a period of time, most of our factories are able to run formula carts and run products for other regions, which gives us flexibility on our footprint to overcome short-term challenges. Jon Moeller : One other dynamic that feeds into this is the confidence of our suppliers in our business, both in terms of our business momentum. So if they need to make investments to increase their capacity and material availability, the momentum of our business factors directly into that decision. Second and related, the increments of capacity that we can offtake to generate economics at the supplier level that make investments viable. If we were just adding to demand on the margin, it would be a very different equation. So we become a very attractive customer for our suppliers because of both the size and importantly, the momentum of our business. Operator : All right. Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Nik Modi : Yes, thank you. Good morning, everyone. So just a quick follow-up on the materials question, then I have a broader question. Which materials are you having the most issues with in terms of sourcing? So that's just a follow-up. And then the broader question is -- again, Jon, congrats for getting appointed to CEO for Procter & Gamble. And I wanted to follow up on the comments you made regarding continuing to invest. That is a priority. But what if the cost situation gets worse? What if competitors don't act rationally in pricing? It looks like they will, but what if they don't? As a CEO of Procter & Gamble, what trade-offs are you willing to make? Is there a threshold where you say, \"Hey, look, we have to cut back on investments, could be up to protect margins within the invest -- down the road. \" Any clarity around that would be very helpful. Andre Schulten : Thanks, Nik. On the materials question, look I think the -- both the run-up and cost is very broad-based across all material classes, and that's the indication of demand to supply situation. It's really different week-by-week. I wouldn't point to any specific material that is structurally more exposed than another. It is really is across the input basket. And again, the dynamics I was describing within all supply chain is how we're dealing with it. And the change is really period by period. On the overall costs trade-off versus strategy. I will start and then I'm sure Jon has a lot to add here. I would say that sticking to our strategy is core and the commitment is relentless. We have over many periods tried to do it in a different way and that is not a good outcome. So our ability to continue to invest in superiority, drive innovation, grow markets, and thereby build our share and improve our retailer's business is core to the business model of balanced growth. Balanced growth across the top-line with moderate margin expansion to drive the bottom line and cash productivity, is the only way forward for the industry and is the way forward for P&G. We will continue to be on this task even if in the short-term and mid-term, that means margin pressure will continue to rise. We would do everything possible within our P&L within the balance sheet to optimize for productivity. And we continue to have significant opportunities in productivity that do not impact our ability to run the business model. When you think about our marketing spend, we estimate there's still significant opportunity to optimize in the ability to reach consumers more broadly and more effectively at significantly lower cost as our digital reach increases. We have significant opportunities still in our supply chain to optimize, leverage the digitization we've been investing in in our supply chain over the past years, better synchronize demand from suppliers all the way to retail partners, and there's certainly still opportunities within our overhead structure where we can optimize work processes, leverage innovation, leverage automation to focus employees on higher order tasks. So, Jon, I'm sure you have a point of view here. Jon Moeller : I might. Just a couple of pieces of perspective. First, this is a time to step forward, not back. Second, Andre in his repaired -- prepared remarks, articulated again the three priorities and the integrated set of strategies. Nowhere in there, at least to my ears, is pulling back on investment. The third and last piece of perspective I'd offer, the productivity muscle that we've built, ad Andre was just describing the opportunities that remain there which are significant, will or should build margin over time. If we look at the last 12 years, our operating margin on an all-in basis has increased 320 basis point from 20.4% to 23.6% last year. On a constant currency basis, that's an increase of a 1020 basis points. So the game here is stay on course, continue to drive productivity to fuel investment and superiority in daily use categories where performance drives brand choice. We do all of that over time. As Andre said, that is the recipe for balanced growth, growing the topline and the bottom line. We were in an environment where there will be volatility across quarters. That's not our concern. We're concerned about the execution of the holistic strategy and the value that, that creates over time. Operator : Okay. Your next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citi. Wendy Nicholson : Hi. Just following up on that, Jon. I know the enterprise markets have been an area of focus for you over the last couple of years. And my understanding is that as some of those enterprise markets go from either operating at a loss or break eve to becoming more profitable, that could serve as an incremental margin driver. Doesn't all have to be productivity, it can be mix as some of those lower-margin regions become more profitable. Can you give us an update on those enterprise markets? Have some swung to be less of a whatever -- hold back from a margin perspective and what's the outlook there? And then Andre, you talked so fast at the beginning. I didn't get the number for the growth and the enterprise markets. If you could give us that, again, that'd be great. Thank you. Jon Moeller : If I reflect just back on last fiscal year with enterprise markets grew top line of 5%, build share grew bottom line ahead of the rest of the Company at 11%. We executed -- sorry. We exited the year with only one of those 80 plus markets losing money and that was Argentina, where we have a plan to address that overtime this Fiscal year. So we're on a very good position in enterprise markets. If we look at the quarter we just completed, focus markets grew 4%, enterprise markets grew 5%. Having said all of that, part of a responsible answer has to address the volatility that exists in these markets from a geopolitical standpoint and unfortunately from a health and COVID standpoint. So it's not a straight line in all likelihood from here to there but we're much, much better positioned and I'll give all the credit to the teams on the ground and these markets who are operating in very difficult, but as you rightly indicate, promising environments. Andre Schulten : Thanks for the feedback on the speed, Wendy. I will adjust. Operator : Okay. Your next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Hey, good morning, folks. Thanks for slotting me in, and congrats on a decent start to the year. A couple of quick questions. First, can you expound more on what's happening in China, particularly on the beauty business? To think there are some references in the press release around mix and some slowing growth in Skin Care I suspect it's tethered to China. And secondly, more high level, it will be interesting how the earnings season plays out. But I'm guessing when we look back in the rear view mirror, you will have recorded one of the weakest price lines in the group and perhaps be the only one to not show sequential acceleration. And I guess my question is, why are we not seeing more? Is this a competitive strategy? And if so, how much your market share momentum would you attribute to your -- what seems to be an approach to dragging your feet on price? And should we be concerned that once you catch up, that some of these market share momentum could stall? Andre Schulten : Okay. There's a lot in there. So let me start with China. We continue to believe that China is a very attractive and important growth market for us. As we said, quarter 1 was flat in terms of organic sales growth, but on a two-year stack basis we are up 12%, which is ahead of the market. We would have expected some quarter-to-quarter volatility due to base period dynamics and also some continued effects of COVID shutdowns on a regional level. Overall, we feel well-positioned with our portfolio within China and expect the market to return to mid-single-digit growth going forward. Again, we take some comfort in that retail sales coming up to above 4% again in the past quarter. On beauty specifically, we've seen all strongest results in healthcare in fiscal '21, '22 in China with strong top-line growth and strong bottom-line growth. SK-II sales were flat in China for the quarter, but again, on a 13% increase last fiscal year. We see travel retail coming up in SK-II, so that also needs to be considered as we think about the total market of SK-II consumption. Certainly a slowdown in the market in the first quarter, and specifically, as you point out, on Skin Care and in the beauty sector. Overall, we feel still confident in our ability to win in the market and in the market's ability to sustain that single-digit market growth. Jason English : Thank you. And on the price side, other dynamics? Andre Schulten : Yeah. Sorry. On the pricing side, the reason why we're not seeing the pricing come through at this point in time is a couple of dynamics. Number 1, most of the pricing went into effect in September. So you only have less than a month really of pricing in the first quarter. We're also annualizing the base period where we had to lower promotion in the market as you recall. We are now seeing the normalization of commotion levels back to around 30% volumes sold on deal. So that's certainly offsetting some of the pricing that you otherwise would see flow through. I -- we certainly expect pricing to become a bigger part of the top-line and the bottom-line construct going forward as the pricing again materializes in the markets. And as we said before, we are not lagging pricing, we are driving pricing by category, ideally in line with innovation to ensure that we have the best possible value creation for consumers. We're executing SKU by SKU, market-by-market in what is right for that market in that particular scenario, and that's driving the pricing. And we expect pricing to be a net positive to the top-line and to the share position. Operator : And next question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein with Evercore. Robert Ottenstein : Great. Thank you very much. Based on some of the analysis that we've done, it looks like e-commerce in the U.S. continues to be very strong against pretty tough comps and that you guys are up well into double digits. Can you, number one, confirm that? Maybe give us a sense of what percentage of your business is e-commerce now, in the U.S. and globally. And then, going into it a little bit more. How do you see e-commerce driving your overall categories now? Is it driving premiumization? Are you continuing to gain or hold share in e-commerce? Just any thoughts and whether you're surprised that e-commerce has been so strong against such difficult comps. Thank you. Andre Schulten : So e-commerce grows at a global level, continues to be very strong. We're up 16% in our e-comm business at a global level, that's a 66% two-year stack. Our e-comm business represents at this point in time about 14% of our total sales. And that's really across all e-comm channels. So it's not just pure plays. It's specifically in the U.S. is obviously pure play. But many of our omni partners, so when you think about target.com, walmart.com, etc, where you have fulfillment from store -- pick -up at store, play a significant role in that growth trajectory. The business in the U.S., specifically, we see about 11% growth in our e-com business. So again, continued strong momentum across all of these formats. We are well-positioned in e-comm for multiple reasons. As we explained before, we believe that a focus on strong brands as driven by COVID is benefiting us, specifically also in an e-com environment where we show up and search on the first page. And we are generally able to explain our benefits, our superiority, via more detailed e-content than we would be at a shelf for example. We have strong relationships with our partners as it comes to developing propositions and ensuring that our positions are fit for use in either e-comm channels or omni -channels. And when you think about an omni -environment, being the leading brand, generally results in more shelf space, more inventory on the shelf. So as consumers order, we can make sure that we are in-stock. That as we're being picked up, we have product on shelf and therefore can be found and can be fulfilled in-store. So generally, e-com, we believe, plays to our strengths and we can support our e-com business with strong marketing and brand building to sustain that level of growth. Operator : Next question will come from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JP Morgan. Andrea Teixeira : Hi, good morning. I have a follow-up on Andre's comments on the anniversary of the promotional normalization. If I understood it correctly, you had 60 basis points headwind in gross margin in what you call product and packaging investment and also 90 basis points investment in marketing on SG&A line. So correct me if I'm wrong, I think you were saying you'll continue to invest to keep your superiority, of course, you're going to lean in and it's the time to lean in, But perhaps how should we be thinking on your ability to flex once pricing is implemented? A nd I'm assuming most of your competitors will follow or actually had lab before even. So how we should be thinking or investments going forward? Thank you. Andre Schulten : Yeah. As you've seen in this quarter, we continue to invest in line with our all-in growth. So our marketing spend, our ad spend is up a $130 million and that's what you should expect going forward. So as long as we can create a good return of investment with our incremental spend, we will continue to do so. At the same time, as I mentioned before, there's still significant opportunity to increase the efficiency of our marketing spend. So as we increase digital reach, as we are getting better at targeting, we can both increase reach and quality of reach and therefore offset some of that incremental investment by pure efficiency within the marketing spend. In terms of promotional dynamics, as I mentioned, we are -- the market is coming back up to more normal levels. Pre-COVID period promotion volumes were running at about 33%. Currently, we're back up about 30%. So we expect it to remain around that level. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark Astrachan : Thanks and good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask one follow-up and one other question. So just on China, I thought you'd mentioned in your prepared remarks that you'd seen some of the weakness intra-quarter, I guess implying that it's gotten better so perhaps you could just talk about that dynamic as you exited the quarter there in terms of your total business's schedule, however you want to think about it. And then on the marketing investment, it's interesting that you continue to have efficiencies there to offset increased in investment. I guess the question is. how sustainable is that? And then are we to think that you take the efficiencies in invested all kind of backend marketing so that you remain fully funded or even increase off of current levels. Andre Schulten : On the first part of the question on China Beauty, we certainly saw some decrease in market size in the earlier part of the quarter. Sequentially, we see that recovering. We also expect, as I mentioned before, a return to mid-single digit growth across categories, so really not much more to add there. From a marketing efficiency standpoint, I think you'll see a combination of both. We -- as I said, I think we'll continue to drive efficiency as we bring more media spend into our optimized targeting pool as we increase the percentage of digital media around the world, as we continue to optimize our own algorithms to target messaging to consumers. There continues to be significant opportunity. And you'll see a combination of reinvestment in marketing programs and flowing those productivity effect into the P&L to offset some of the cost pressures. And it'll vary quarter-by-quarter depending on the situation. Jon Moeller : And it might seem kind of an odd dynamic. But the more efficient and effective we can make our marketing spend be, and as Andre indicated just now, there's lots of opportunity to continue to do that, the more attractive it comes -- becomes to make those investments. So maybe what -- well, in somewhat of an odd way, efficiency breeds effectiveness, effectiveness breeds spending. And that all drives the market and the business. Operator : All right, the next question comes from the line of Camilo Garcia Walla with Credit Suisse. Camilo Garcia Walla : Hey, everybody. Good morning. I'd like to talk maybe a little bit more about the consumer condition. Obviously the market seem -- obviously your business has a lot of momentum, but it feels like the consumer is in a notably strong position at the moment. I'm curious if you agree with that, and if you do, what precisely, maybe that you're seeing is behind some of the strong demand? And then if I could layer on top of that question, we're just observing your numbers coming in better than expected, pricing is still yet to become a larger contributor, your comps are getting easier. Some of the conversations we've had this morning was -- is around why not bring up your organic revenue guidance for the year? So please add some color on that, would be helpful. Andre Schulten : Yeah. Okay. So I think the strength of consumption, our categories is really driven by the choice of categories that we operate in. We've chosen to be not in discretionary, but in daily use essential categories for the consumer. Again, health, hygiene focused and the clean home. The consumer continues to elevate the importance of these jobs coming out of COVID, as we've seen in COVID. And I think that continues to drive the importance of these categories and our ability to win in these categories because consumers return or turn to trusted brands because they know that they can deliver on the promise and the job to be done. We see that in our share results. And as Jon mentioned, we see it in the reverse share results of private label, for example, declining both in the U.S. and Europe overtime. We also benefit, and the consumer spending shows it, from more time at home, which we believe is an ongoing phenomena. More time at home means more meals at home, more dishwashing at home, more laundry at home. And again, those elements benefit our brands and our categories in terms of growth. We will continue to focus on superiority, as we said before, to ensure that we have the strongest solutions for our consumers at any price point, at any price ladder. But really, we benefit, I think, from overall more time at home and an elevated focus on all categories. On the organic price mix and guidance, you're right and we're expecting pricing to become a bigger part of the top line construct, as we said, throughout the year. We are one quarter in. There's a lot of volatility in the market and so we believe that it's prudent to maintain the guidance range of 2% to 4% on the top-line. But as we said in our prepared remarks, Quarter 1 results give us confidence to the upper half of that guidance range. Jon Moeller : I would just make one additional comment which relates to the consumer and their behavior in these categories. Again, daily use where performance drives brand choice, often providing a health, hygiene or clean home benefit. And let me just give you an example of what's possible. One of our more recent innovations in Oral Care, for example, the iO power brush premium priced product. we have -- since the introduction of that about a year ago, we've built over 2 points of share, which has come by driving the market. The market is up 14%, over that period of time we've driven over 50% of that. So what you see is a consumer who is responsive to performance-based innovation. We can utilize that responsiveness to grow markets in a constructive way, which as Andre has mentioned many times, is beneficial to our retail partners and is constructive from market dynamics standpoint. So there are many categories where through performance-based innovation, we can provide more delight through regimen solutions. We can provide more delight -- the consumer generally is responsive to performance in these categories. And consumption is expandable. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Chris Carey : Hi, good morning. Thanks so much. Just to confirm an answer to the prior question in a category specific question. Just around the organic sales guidance for the year, you've made some statements just around material supply, supply chain constraints, how much of that is factored into how you're thinking about the full-year organic sales outlook? And then just from a category's perspective, Fabric Care has been a good story. Loans were particularly strong again on difficult comp. Just in general, what do you think is driving the share gains that you've seeing in the category? We've heard about some material constraints for some of your competitors. Do you think that's a factor? Is it just more about innovation? Just in general, do you have some perspective on what you think is driving this particularly strong delivery on the Fabric Care side of the business. Thanks. Andre Schulten : Yeah, thank you. On organic sales guidance, as we said, I think the supply chain pressures that we see today and our ability to deal with those pressures, as we have been over the past 18 to 24 months, is anticipated to continue in the organic sales guidance that we've given. And any unforeseen major disruptions, obviously, we will have to reassess and see where we are. But we feel good about our ability to deal with the ongoing supply chain pressures, and that's reflected in the organic sales guidance. Look, I think the story behind Fabric Care is really bringing to live the strategy. This is a category where performance drives brand choice, where daily use is essential to the consumer and performance is very visible. And the category has done a phenomenal job in driving superiority with new forms, or by creating new jobs to be done that are relevant for the consumer. If you think about single unit dose, for example, very superior proposition, very insightful in -- very intuitive to the consumer in terms of use. A premiumization of the category in trading up dollars per wash with superior cleaning properties. And penetration outside of the U.S. still is a significant growth opportunity. In Germany and Canada, we're only at 20% wholesale penetration on single unit bills and in Japan, we're only at 11%. So there continues to be significant runway with a truly superior product form. We also, in Fabric Care, have done -- the team has done a phenomenal job in looking into fast-growing new segments. When you think about fabric enhancers, 14% growth in the quarter. Bits for example, right now is a billion-dollar brand and continues to grow significantly. Wholesale penetration in the U.S. on bits only 20%, low penetration only about 30%. There continues to be significant runway with superior innovation and superior products. We continue to drive that and that's what you see in the results. Operator : All right. And your final question comes from the line of Peter Grom with UBS. Peter Grom : Hey, good morning everyone. I would love to just get your view on what you're seeing in emerging markets around the world, particularly in Latin America. Have you seen any changes in terms of category growth or the health of the broader consumer in that region? And I know you previously discussed a prolonged recovery and a number of these markets. Is that still the right thinking as we look out to the balance of the year? Thanks. Jon Moeller : Latin America, I'll speak to that just because it's a business I've been supporting over the last period of time here, overall continues to deliver very solid growth. And that's broad based. In the last quarter, Mexico up, I think about 8%. Argentina -- sorry, Brazil up double-digits. And now, Latin America comes with its inherent challenges. And one of those currently is a -- is the health challenge that exists in many markets which you I'm sure are familiar with. But generally, consumption is strong and our business is very strong in Latin America. Peter Grom : All right. Jon Moeller : Thank you. Andre Schulten : I think that concludes the call. Again, thank you for joining us. And again, if you have any questions, John Chevalier or I are available all day. So if you want to give us a call, please feel free to. And thanks again for joining us for our quarter one call. Have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to Procter & Gamble's Quarter-End Conference Call. Today's event is being recorded for replay. This discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from these projections. As required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the Company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business trends and has posted on its Investor Relations website, www.pginvestor.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Now, I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer, Andre Schulten. Andre Schulten : Good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Jon Moeller, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Chevalier, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. We're going to keep our prepared remarks brief and then turn straight to your questions. Q2 was a strong quarter, very strong top line growth, sequential earnings progress in the face of significant cost headwinds, continued strong cash productivity. Our progress enables us to confirm fiscal year EPS guidance while increasing our estimates for top line growth, cash productivity and cash return to share owners. Organic sales grew more than 6%. Volume contributed 3 points of sales growth, pricing added 3 points as September/October price increases flow through, and as year-on-year promotion comparisons normalize, mix was neutral for the quarter. These strong company results are grounded in broad-based category and geographic strength. Each of the 10 product categories grew our health organic sales in the quarter, Personal Health Care grew 20%, Fabric Care and Feminine Care were up double digits, Baby Care up high singles, Grooming grew mid singles. Home Care, Oral Care, Hair Care and Skin and Personal Care each grew low single-digit. Family Care organic sales were in line with prior year. Focus Markets grew 6% and Enterprise Markets were up 7% In Focus Markets, U.S. organic sales were up 9% despite 12% growth in the base period. On a two-year stack basis, U.S. organic sales are up 21%. Europe Focus Markets were up 5%. Greater China organic sales were in line with prior year against the strong 12% bass period comp and due to slower market growth in the quarter. In addition, we took proactive steps in the quarter to encourage our network of distributors to reduce inventory levels to reflect short-term consumer demand softness in the market. Latin America led the growth in Enterprise Markets up 15%. Global aggregate market share increased 60 basis points, 38 of our top 50 category country combinations held or grew share for the quarter. Our superiority strategy continues to drive strong market growth and in turn share growth for P&G. All general market value in the U.S. categories in which we compete grew nearly 3.5% this quarter. P&G value share continued to grow up nearly 1.5 points versus same quarter last year now at 34%. Importantly, the share growth is broad-based. Nine out of 10 product categories grew share over the past three, six and 12 month periods in the U.S. Consumers continue to prefer P&G brands and superior performance they provide even as inflation is impacting household budgets. On the bottom line, core earnings per share were $1.66, up 1% versus the prior year. On a currency-neutral basis, core EPS increased 2%. Core gross margin decreased 400 basis points and currency-neutral core gross margin was down 410 basis points. Higher commodity and freight cost impact combined were a 460 basis points hit to gross margins. Mix was 140 basis points headwind, mainly from product mix impacts. Productivity savings and pricing each provided partial offsets to the gross margin headwinds. Within SG&,A advertising spending increased versus prior year as we continue to invest to communicate the superiority of our brands. However, overall marketing expense as a percentage of sales decreased 80 basis points, driven by sales leverage and savings in non-working marketing costs. Core operating margin decreased 250 basis points. Currency neutral core operating margin declined 240 basis points. Productivity improvements were 150 basis point help to the quarter. Free cash flow productivity was 106%. We returned nearly $7 billion of cash to share owners, approximately $2.2 billion in dividends and $4.8 billion in share repurchase. In summary, while input cost and supply chains remained challenging, we delivered good results for the second quarter and for the first half of the fiscal year, keeping us on track to deliver our going-in earnings estimates and to raise estimates for sales, cash productivity, and cash return to share owners, which I'll come back to later. Moving on to strategy. Our team continues to operate with excellence and stays focused on the near-term priorities and long-term strategies that enabled us to create strong momentum prior to the COVID crisis, and to make our business even stronger since the crisis began. We continue to step forward into the challenges and to double down our efforts to delight consumers. As we continue to manage through this crisis, we remain focused on the three priorities that has been guiding our near-term actions and choices. First is ensuring the health and safety of our P&G colleagues around the world. Second, maximizing the availability of our products to help people and their families with a cleaning health and hygiene needs. Third priority, supporting the communities, relief agencies and people who are on the frontlines of this global pandemic. The strategic choices we've made are the foundation for balanced top and bottom line growth and value creation. A portfolio of daily use products, many providing cleaning health and hygiene benefits in categories where performance plays a significant role in brand choice. In these performance-driven categories, we've raised the bar on all aspects of superiority, product, package, brand communication, retail execution, and value. Superior offerings delivered with superior execution, drive market growth and our categories. This drives value creation for our retail partners and builds market share for P&G brands. The superiority model works in each of our categories. Take the three category growth drivers this quarter : Personal Health Care, Fabric Care, and Feminine Care, very different categories, different competitors, different geographic footprints, and different materials and manufacturing processes, each delivering superiority and each growing organic sales double digits. In each of these categories P&G is driving a disproportionate share of overall category value growth growing the pie for all participants. We've made investments to strengthen the health and competitiveness of our brands across innovation, supply chains and brand equity. And we'll continue to invest to extend our margin of advantage and quality of execution, improving solutions for consumers around the world. Building on the strength of our brands, we are thoughtfully executing tailored price increases, we closed couple price increases with innovation to improve consumer value along the way. The strategic need for investment to continue to strengthen the superiority of our brands, the short-term need to manage through this challenging cost environment and the ongoing need to drive balance top and bottom line growth, including margin expansion underscore the importance of ongoing productivity. We're committed to driving cost savings and cash productivity in all facets of our business. No area of cost is left untouched. Each business is driving productivity within the P&L and balance sheet to support balance top and bottom line growth and strong cash generation. Success in our highly competitive industry requires agility that comes through the mind set of constructive disruption, of willingness to change, adapt and create new trends and technologies that will shape our industry in the future. In the current environment, that agility and constructive disruption mindset are even more important. Our organizational structure yields are more empowered, agile and accountable organization with little overlap or redundancy, flowing to new demands seamlessly supporting each other to deliver against our priorities around the world. These strategic choices of portfolio superiority, productivity, constructive disruption and organization structure and culture are not independent strategies they reinforce and build on each other. When executed well, they grow markets, which in turn growth shares, sales and profit. These strategies were delivering strong results before the crisis have served us well during these volatile times, and we're confident they remain the right strategic framework as we move through and beyond the crisis. Moving on to guidance, we said last quarter that we would undoubtedly experience more volatility as we move through the fiscal year. The Omicron variant has certainly proven this to be correct. As we saw in the first half of the fiscal year, growth, results going forward will be heavily influenced by base period effects. Along with these realities of current year cost pressures, foreign exchange, volatility and continued effects of the global pandemic on supply chains and consumer behavior. Transportation and labor markets remain tight, availability of materials remain stretched in some categories and in some markets, inflationary pressures are broad based with little sign of near term relief. These costs and operational challenges are not unique to P&G, and we won't be immune to the impact. However, we think the strategies we've chosen, the investments we've made and the focus on executional excellence have positioned us well to manage through this volatility over time. The recent spike in virus cases and resulting lockdowns, increase the risk of additional work stoppages in our operations or in those of our suppliers. Based on current spot prices, we now estimate a $2.3 billion after tax commodity cost headwind in fiscal 2022. Since our last update, we've seen continued increases in diesel and chemicals with little offset and other materials. Trade costs have continued to increase, we now expect freight and transportation costs to be an incremental $300 million after tax headwind for fiscal 2022. Foreign exchange rates have also moved against us since our last guidance, we now expect FX to be a $200 million after tax headwind to earnings for the fiscal year. We will offset a portion of these cost pressures with price increases and with productivity savings. We've now announced price increases in each of our 10 product categories in the U.S. increases in Baby Care, Feminine Care, Adult Incontinence, Family Care, Home Care, Hair Care, Grooming, Oral Care, Skincare, are now effective in market. We also increased prices on mid-tier liquid detergents, and powder detergents over the last few months. In mid-December, we announced to retailers that effective February 28 we are increasing pricing on the balance of our Fabric Care portfolio. This includes Tide, Gain, Downy Bounce at unstoppables, and includes all forms liquid and unit-dose detergents, scent beads, liquid fabric softeners and dryer sheets. Just yesterday, we announced to retailers that we are increasing pricing on certain personal healthcare brands in the U.S. effective mid-April. The degree and timing of these moves are very specific to the category, brand and sometimes the product form within a brand. This is not a one size fits all approach. We're also taking pricing in many markets outside the U.S. to offset commodity freight and foreign exchange impacts. As we said before, we believe this is a temporary bottom line rough patch to grow through not a reason to reduce investment in the business. We're sticking with a strategy that has been working well before and during the COVID crisis. Moving to the key metric guidance. We now expect organic sales growth in the range of 4% to 5% for the fiscal year, up from our initial range of 2% to 4%. We expect pricing to be a larger contributor to sales growth in the back half of the fiscal year as more of our price increases become effective in the market. As this pricing reaches store shelves we\u2019ll be closely monitoring consumption trends. So far, we haven't seen noticeable changes in consumer behavior. Demand for our best performing premium priced offerings remains very strong as to our market share trends. On the bottom line, we're confirming our outlook of core earnings per share growth in a range of 3% to 6%. In total, our revised outlook for the impact of materials, freight and foreign exchange is now a $2.8 billion after tax headwind for fiscal 2022 earnings, or roughly $1.10 per share, a 20 percentage point headwind to core EPS growth. Despite these cost challenges, we are committed to maintaining strong investment in our brands, as pricing goes into effect and as we annualize the initial spike in input costs, earnings growth should be sequentially stronger in the third and fourth quarter of the fiscal. We are increasing our outlook for adjusted free cash flow productivity to 95%. And we are raising our guidance for cash return to share owners. We continue to expect to pay over $8 billion in dividends. And we now plan to repurchase $9 billion to $10 billion of common stock combined a plan to return $17 billion to $18 billion of cash to share owners this fiscal year. This outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates commodity price and foreign exchange rates, significant additional currency weakness, commodity cost increases geopolitical disruption, major supply chain disruptions or store closures are not anticipated within the guidance ranges. To conclude our business exhibited strong momentum well before the COVID crisis. We strengthened our position further during the crisis that we believe P&G is well positioned to grow beyond the crisis. We will manage to the near term cost pressures and continued market level volatility with the strategy we've outlined many times and against the immediate priorities of ensuring employee health and safety, maximizing availability of our products and helping society overcome the COVID challenges that still exist in many parts of the world. We'll continue to step forward toward our opportunities and remain fully invested in our business. We remain committed to driving productivity improvements to fund growth investments, mitigate input cost challenges, and to maintain balance top and bottom line growth. With that, we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : Good morning. So the top line side clearly strong results across the board, but Beauty top line growth was below consensus in the quarter. So just any thoughts on the Beauty top line performance? And specifically maybe you can talk about China Beauty from a category and market share perspective in the December quarter? And any go-forward thoughts on China Beauty or China in general given the flattish year-over-year trends in the quarter? And then on the rest of the business with the strong market share results, can you just talk about your level of confidence going forward and sustaining those share gains and how supply chain and consumer and retailer acceptance of price increases may impact the forward outlook from a market share perspective? Thanks. Andre Schulten : All right. Good morning, Dara, that's a lot. So let me start with maybe two and focus on Beauty and China within that. Look, if you look at our Beauty business over a longer period of time, the business has actually delivered about $3 billion in incremental sales over the past five years, more than $1 billion of incremental profit, significant contribution to shareholder return, 25 consecutive quarters of organic sales growth, including this quarter. When we look at this quarter on a two-year stack, on Beauty, it\u2019s 7% for quarter two, quarter one was a 9% stack. The Health Care growing 2%, Skin and Personal Care growing 3%. So we feel good about the overall performance of the Beauty business and the strength of the core portfolio. There is significant runway, I'll comment on China in a minute. We certainly saw a slowdown in some of the Beauty portfolio, namely SK-II which we've mentioned before, store closures of department stores, lower traffic there, and also slower key consumption periods in some of the China events. And honestly, our unwillingness to go into very deep discount levels on the brand have contributed to a slower growth in quarter two. Overall, the portfolio is strong. We believe has very strong growth potential in the future. We are also excited about the acquisitions we've announced. Tula, Farmacy Beauty and Ouai, all focused on the premium end of the trade in the U.S. premium consumers, which is a giving up opportunity for additional top line growth and value creation in the U.S. and also globally. On China, I\u2019ll start with a similar comment. China, over the past four or five years, has delivered high singles or low-teens sales growth. We have a stable or very strong brands. We continue to believe that consumption after a weaker period in quarter one, as you have seen, and quarter two in the market. Consumption in our categories were returned to mid singles and we feel well-positioned to benefit from that growth with a strong organization, strong supply chain and strong R&D capability on the ground. The other point to note even with China being flat in the quarter, from a global perspective, we were able to grow more than 6%. And part of that is the strength of the geographic portfolio that we need to focus on because in some markets, we might have to invest. China certainly is at this point in time, as you point out weaker in an overall - from an overall consumption standpoint. So I'll stop there. I'm sure we'll get back to your other questions and some of the other comments, Dara. Operator : All right. The next question will come from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks. Good morning. I was curious to talk a little bit about productivity. The contribution this quarter was only I think 80 basis points. It was cited in the release. And just I would guess that means a big ramp up in the second half. So I was curious, why relative to timing, if it has to do with COVID and absenteeism if it's related to how you calculate this based on raw material access, and so on. But just anything you can share on productivity plans, and timing would be helpful? Thanks. Andre Schulten : Yes. Good morning, Lauren. Productivity, the number of 80 basis points in the quarter, we expect about $800 million BT productivity contribution from cost of goods for the year. And it's a little bit lighter than what we would have done in previous years. But most importantly, we remain fully committed to productivity as a core driver of margin expansion. In the short-term, there are a couple of effects that I want to spend a minute on. Number one, when you think about cost savings projects, they require line time, that line time is competing with the need to ship cases in a very constrained supply chain. When we think about innovation, we talk frequently about our desire to close copper price increases with innovation. Innovation also needs lifetime. So cost savings projects on the line also compete with innovation, and they compete with our desire and need to ship the business. Therefore, in a constrained environment, as you point out, our businesses make the decision to focus on innovation, focus on shipping the business, which is better for retailers, better for consumers, better for us in terms of value creation, but it has an impact on cost savings. The good news is these cost savings are available to us in the future, they don't go anywhere. But you see a little bit slower ramp up in that context. Second element I would mention is the global pressure on supply chain. And the flexibility that we talked about that our supply people have generated, doesn't come for free. So when we need to shift to alternate materials, when we need to shift to alternate suppliers, or sources of materials geographically, that comes as a premium, which goes against productivity, again, the right choice, because shipping the cases is financially more viable than creating the cost saving. But it has an impact. And then the last point I'll make is, negotiating commercial savings when everyone is trying to get the materials in sufficient quantity is also a bit more difficult. So all of that to say short-term, pressure, longer-term, fully committed to productivity being a core driver of margin expansion and balance growth model. and you see progress quarter by quarter. Jon Moeller : I would just add, Lauren, that, Omicron hasn't helped. It further pressurizes the dynamics that Andre spoke about, and it just reduces the resources we have available at any point in time to work on these things. When - as people become infected and need to quarantine, as they need to take care of family members, as children's schools are closed, all of those things have a real impact, which to Andre\u2019s point, should lighten as hopefully, everyone on the call, please cross your fingers as we go forward. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thank you. Operator : All right. Next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Steve Powers : Hey, thanks, and good morning. Maybe building on that a little bit. So as we think about the back half and the leverage that you have at your disposal to offset the $2.8 billion in commodity freight currency headwinds that you now face. I guess, can you talk a little bit \u2013 I guess, can you elaborate a little bit more on the initiatives that you've put in place specifically over the last three months to help with that in as we get to calendar 2022. And I guess I'm specifically curious when we think about the second half P&L as to how you anticipate the drivers of organic growth shaking out price versus volume, number one. And then number two, whether we should expect marketing, inclusive of non-working media productivity to remain a continuous source of positive leverage as the year continues? Andre Schulten : Good morning, Steve. Alright, so from a growth margin perspective, a couple of things will come to play here. If you will assume that the existing commodity foreign exchange rate and transportation warehousing pressures remain at this level, which is our basis for planning, we will benefit from more pricing flowing through the P&L. Most of all price increases that you've seen in our prepared remarks have gone, or some have gone into effect in September and October, but the majority of the price increases are still coming into effect over December, quarter one, quarter three and quarter four. So the contribution of pricing both to gross margin recover as well as to the price mix line within the top line is going to increase sequentially, as we go through the fiscal year. We also will see in the base period, the commodity pressures are coming into the base gross margin, starting with the third quarter, and then really flowing in the fourth quarter based comparison. So that's going to help the gross margin comparison as well. And lastly, the continuation of hopefully, more stability in the labor force more stability around COVID as we exit this winter, will allow us to increase contribution from productivity as I've talked before, which will also help gross margin recovery in the second half. On the pricing contribution versus volume contribution, I expect price to become a bigger part as I said logically because of the timing of the price increases that we have announced. And in terms of ability to sustain the pricing, we have seen for the price increases where we have sufficient read period at this point in time, we have seen a more benign reaction of the consumer, the consumer is healthy generally, and is preferring our brands, we're starting with strong security and price elasticity has generally been lower than what would we what would what we would have seen historically, which also speaks to the fact that we hopefully will continue to see volume growth in combination with a stronger price growth in the background. Jon Moeller : I just want to underscore something that Andre said. Remember, that the pricing that we've announced, even the pricing has taken effect at shelf. We didn't have a full quarter benefit from the quarter we just completed. So that's simple roll forward is a help. And the majority of the pricing that we've announced has not yet taken place. Operator : All right. Next question will be from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Thanks. Good morning, folks. Thank you for stopping in. I wanted to drill a little bit deeper on the cost and price outlook. So a couple of things. First, in response to that last question, I think I got the sense, clearly Telegraph that says the pricing will continue to build back half, it sounds like you're looking for at least 4%, if not more price contribution, or at least about one and a half billion or so net sales contribution. If we look at your cost and of both commodities and freight in the 2.6, I think from your margin bridge it implies that you've already absorbed around 1.7 billion in the front half. So in other words, you're expecting a billion or less in the back half. And we should therefore expect a price cost surplus to emerge. I want to make sure I had all my math right on that at least directionally. And then the second part, you've clearly had to revise your commodity and freight outlook up the last few quarters. Remind us again, what the current commodity outlook is predicated on, so that we can get a proper sense of what the upside downside risk are to that? Thank you. Jon Moeller : Yes. Good morning, Jason. On the commodity and transportation warehousing timing, yes, I mean, I assume your math is right. I won't check it here. But we can certainly follow up as needed. We assume in our forecast in our guidance, spot prices for both the commodity basket and for transportation and warehousing. We've seen increases still in this last cycle as reflected in the increase in commodities and transportation and warehousing. But we're also seeing a slower rate of increase. So hopefully, meaning that we reach the peak here soon. But we are building our financial forecast and all financial planning on that level. So we don't assume any easing in terms of transportation and warehousing or commodity cost impact or foreign exchange for that matter. Operator : Next question will come from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI. Robert Ottenstein : Great, thank you very much. I was wondering if you could give us some sense of how you assess your revenue management skills at this point. Clearly, the results would suggest they're pretty positive. But, we'd love I'd love to understand some maybe some of the changes that you've done over the last few years to improve your ability to manage an inflationary environment. If in fact, you know that is what we're headed into for a long period. Your ability to work with different elasticities manage, trade, spend, etcetera both in the U.S. and overseas and how it may be better than it was in the past? Thank you. Andre Schulten : Very good morning, Robert. If I step back I think we're better positioned for dealing with an inflationary environment or revenue management in that sense than we've ever been before. Starting with a portfolio that is focused on daily use categories health, hygiene and cleaning that are essential to the consumer versus discretionary categories, which in these environments are the first ones to lose focus from the consumer. Secondly, starting with a portfolio that is 75% superior by our assessment and reflected probably in the market share results and trends that we're seeing. We also over time have built much stronger price letters. So we have offerings for the consumer at different price points, and different cash outlays. When you think about diapers, you can get a Luvs diaper for $0.15 a diaper, Swaddlers at $0.30, or Pure diaper at $0.38. And that's generally true across all categories across all brands. So that means the consumer has a choice within our portfolio. So in that sense, I think we are set up well, from a starting point to deal with inflation and related pricing. From an execution standpoint, I think we also benefit from a couple of things. Number one, the organizational redesign in focus markets and enterprise markets enables much faster and much clearer decision making, which is critical in these processes, and also much more diligence in terms of where to take pricing, country brand SKU level. And the other element here is that from an execution standpoint, we certainly have seen that innovation can play a significant role. And the strength of our innovation pipeline, and our ability to combine pricing with innovation is certainly helping us in this environment. That's what I make. And then Jon will probably have comments here as well. We've been operating in high inflation environments around the world for many years. Think about Turkey, Nigeria, Argentina, those are high inflation markets and environments. So we know how to deal with that. Obviously, we hope we don't get to that place, but generally well positioned for the reasons I tried to outline here. Jon Moeller : And just a reminder of the obvious, we're dealing with commodity costs increases that affect every competitor, both multinational and local, which changes the dynamic pretty considerably versus for example, pricing for foreign exchange, which has a differential impact across the competitive set. So it's not an easy job, but it's an easier job than we've managed, as Andre says successfully manage geographies in the recent past. Operator : Next question will come from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : Great, thanks, morning, everyone. I wanted to pivot and ask about M&A on a couple of different fronts, please just number one, the openness to larger scale M&A at this point. I think there was clearly a period in recent years post the portfolio rationalization where the company was sensibly very focused on turning around the portfolio larger scale, M&A wasn't really on the table. So is the organization in a better place? Is the board open to larger scale deals at this point? And if so maybe you could put some guardrails around that. And then relatedly Andre, you touched on some of the smaller tuck-in deals in prestige beauty, which have been picked up here, maybe just spend a moment there define the approach in prestige beauty given past missteps and the decision to exit some of the larger brands that were once in the portfolio there, I think that'd be helpful. Thank you for that. Jon Moeller : Hey Kevin, this is Jon. A couple points on large M&A. The first very, very important point is we like our current portfolio. We have confidence that we can create value with that portfolio. And, frankly, all parts of it are working. Andre mentioned that, we're growing market share in nine out of 10 of those categories. And importantly, that market share growth is not taking business. It's creating business in large part affecting the overall growth of the market. So we're in a very healthy situation with a very healthy portfolio that's underpinned with a clear set of priorities and a very effective tightly integrated set of strategies. And we're adding, we're strengthening our strategic execution by a focus on four areas. One is supply. The second is digital competence across the value chain. The third is employee value. And the fourth is sustainability. We like that hand overall. Second point, our algorithm growing slightly ahead of the market with EPS up mid-to-high singles, assumes 100% organic growth. So again, we don't need large M&A to deliver against that. And we certainly haven't utilized large M&A in the last four or five year period when we've been delivering very regularly on that expectation. A couple other points, and then I'll get to beauty. And then Andre may have some comments on beauty as well. The -- we have said many times that there that we intend to win in these 10 categories that we've selected. And that acquisition would be a part of the way that we may choose to fill out categories in order to win. And we've talked about two categories in particular, that would be particularly focus areas. One is skincare, and the other is personal health care. So all of that remains as true. The last point I would make, which is I realized not very helpful to the audience at hand but as a matter of policy, we don't comment further than what I just have on acquisition or divestiture. On beauty, I want to clarify what I think has been a little bit of a misunderstanding. When we made the portfolio decisions as to what we were going to move out on beauty and what we were going to stay in. We did not make price tier decisions. We did not exit premium beauty, we made category decisions. And we exited several categories that were more discretionary, that were not daily use, and where performance had a lower role in driving brand choice. So for example, we maintained our most premium beauty offering SK-II. So this notion that we're, we got out of a price tier and now we're getting back in is not the way to think about it. We got out of categories. And we're strengthening those categories. And these the brands that we have purchased, as Andre said earlier play in the premium portion of the beauty categories, which are the fastest growing from a market standpoint to date, and obviously give us ample opportunity to create value given their margin structure. Andre, anything to add. Andre Schulten : Nothing to add. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks. Good morning. This is actually [Indiscernible] for Andre here. So just in terms of service levels, can you please comment on your ability to fulfill just given the impacts of employee absenteeism and as improved from the peak amount of con worldwide? Thank you for that. Jon Moeller : Morning. Our ability to supply is relatively stable, is stable actually. If you look at our on-shelf availability, for example in the U.S. Last quarter, we reported that was around 94%, we're still running at about 94% which is not where we want to be which will be more than 98%, 99% range. But good relative to peer group and good given again the overall challenges the industry is seeing, the retail environment seeing. So and that is true around the world. Our supply chain people who deserve all the credit here continue to do an absolutely amazing job making sure that our retail partners have the products available that our consumers want to buy. And there are no major outages given the flexibility we've created within the supply chain. Even in China as we saw regional lockdowns, we were able to shift production into alternative sites and thereby maintain supply. So continued great work while supply organization relatively stable situation, we'll continue to monitor closely because this is not over. So great success now with no guarantee for the future, but we certainly feel well positioned. Operator : Alright, next question will be from the line of Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Chris Carey : Hi, good morning. So one quick follow up on SK-II. Are you seeing that slowdown as temporary normalization in demand? Or do you think the brand is reaching some ceiling on growth, and hence, you've made these additional moves? And then, a broader question just on pricing and baby, price mixing the category has really accelerated, doesn't seem like it was that long ago, that the category was seeing higher promotional activity to drive volumes, can you just expand on the step change there. The drivers of the move on pricing and premiumization why it's the right move. And then, maybe any broader thoughts on, there's been some discussion around, a little bit of a mini baby boom. And I wonder if you have any thoughts there? Thanks so much. Andre Schulten : Alright, good morning. On SK-II, certainly no ceiling for the brand in terms of growth. The brand continues to carry enormous equity with existing users, enormous appeal to new users, specifically in the, in the Asia space. So we continue to be very encouraged by both the current strength of the brand, but also by the future pipeline and the initiatives that are to come. But the brand is operating in channels that are most impacted by the pandemic, that has an impact on our business, it has an impact on total consumption. And lastly, I mentioned this in the earlier question. We don't believe that heavy discounting is the right strategy in the short term to overcome some of these challenges. So we're focusing on building the equity building product efficacy, and running our business model to return to stronger growth here in the future. On the Baby category, your right price mix when you look at the U.S. but also globally is increasing, which is encouraging for two reasons encouraging number one; Baby Care is one of the hardest hit categories from a commodity impact. So it's good to see that the pricing that was taken is flowing through to the P&L to help with productivity, offset some of that commodity pressure. And we see the pricing in Baby flowing through really globally. So that's a core driver, and every player in the industry, as Jon mentioned before, has to find a way to offset these cost pressures that are very significant in this category. More encouraging to me is in our portfolio, the desire of the consumer to move up to higher premium offerings because they truly provide better value for the consumer. When you think about the U.S., for example, most of the growth, if not the absolute majority of the growth comes from tier one, our smallest proposition comes from Cruisers 360, which is a very unique proposition in the pants form for active babies, comes from Pampers Pure, and comes from Ninjamas, which is a bedwetting product, which we re-entered the category created significant growth in the category and build a 9% share position. So the portfolio strategy we're executing the innovation, we're bringing is rewarded by the consumer with trade up and that is a significant contributor to price mix. And hopefully and I think sustainable given the true benefits where we're seeing the consumer appreciate. Jon Moeller : Just a couple of additional points on SK-II to hopefully make it clear and bring it to life what's actually happening here. If you dramatically simplify the SK-II business, you would simplify it historically into two primary channels. One is travel retail and the other is department store. And in both of those channels, it was it's typically been a council product, meaning there's some but there's a knowledgeable person in the store to help you understand the benefits of the product and which elements are right for you. With COVID, travel retail largely closed, in many parts of Asia and ability of counsellors to go to work for the multitude of reasons we're all familiar with, including some regulatory prohibitions. If you look at Japan, you have that dynamic plus you have what was a major source of business, which was Chinese travelers going to Japan to department stores, to buy a product to bring back to their friends and family. That's not happening. So when you ask, why is SK-II, currently soft? Those are the reasons. And as Andre indicated, it has nothing to do with the equity or strength of the brand. We've converted. And I really applaud the team for doing this, a fair amount of that purchase, from those channels to more local channels that support longer -- consumption. But still, the impact of this has been significant. Operator : Alright, next question will come from Wendy Nicholson with Citi. Wendy Nicholson : Hi, I wanted to just go back and talk about the M&A strategy for a minute just with regard to you know, not just the smaller brands that you've just recently announced acquiring, but maybe looking back, and can you give us kind of a little bit of an update on some of the smaller brands you've bought historically, whether it's First Aid Beauty, whether it's Native, or this is L, just to sort of tell us, how have they done? Has it been worth the effort, how fully integrated are they? Because, again, back to the earlier discussion about M&A? I think the question I would have is, these are small companies that obviously are growing rapidly now, but is it worth the hassle? Is it worth the effort? Is it worth the money to bring them into the P&G fold? Can they really ever move the needle? So just sort of, updating us on maybe your track record with regard to the prior small acquisitions you've made? Thanks. Andre Schulten : Yes, very good. So when we have these discussion on is their value in integrating the small tuck-in acquisitions, we're obviously asking the exact same question. And the track record within beauty is actually very good. When you look at First Aid Beauty and Native as good examples, we've been able to bring these brands in, built on their existing sales basis, expand distribution, expand innovation, and marketing support across channels, and significantly grow both the net sales and value base. So the beauty organization's ability to take these small brands maintain their character and user base and apply our strength to grow them, is actually very promising. And that's the underlying hypothesis and reason why we believe these three acquisitions will create significant value for beauty as well. Their approach of bringing these brands in is also unique in the sense that the beauty organization is really taking time to bring the visiting organization into the P&G ecosystem, have them operate more independently than we've done in the past, to ensure that the character of the brand and the key strength of the brand are maintained, and then we carefully build on top. So high confidence based on previous experience would be my summary. Jon Moeller : Let me just add a couple things here. Wendy. Our beauty business, historically has been built this way. So we acquired for example, Old Spice, we acquired Olay. Pantene, and Head & Shoulders were tiny. We're talking less than $100 million in sales, and how they're two of the largest shampoos in the world. That doesn't give us any guarantee. But it certainly as Andre was indicating a strong track record to build from. That's point one. Point two, relative to the company's ability to handle M&A and by the way, and spending time on this, I'm not suggesting that the emphasis or focus has shifted in that direction by any stretch of the imagination. The best example that I can point to because we've had the longest track record with it is the Merck OTC acquisition, different category, but so far an incredibly successful acquisition. Our OTC business grew at 20% and the quarter that we just completed and it's doing so very profitably Having said all that, probably more than any other person and I don't mean to personalize this. I've got more blood on my back from cleaning up lots of small brands. I spent four years of my life doing it. We are going to be very disciplined. And we'll get an early read on whether we think things are going to work according to plan or not. And if not, we'll pivot. Operator : All right, next question will come from the line of Nick Modi with RBC. Nik Modi : Yes, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just a housekeeping or follow up? And then a broader question, on the follow up Andre, is there any way you can provide any quantification on the out of stock impact on organic revenue growth this quarter? And then the broader question, I guess this would be for you, Jon is just when you think about the consumer and segmentation strategy at P&G, if you think about the Gen Z consumer, do you think that you have the core brand set is broad enough to reach that consumer? Do you feel like you need to, launch new brands or, make some of these acquisitions that you've discussed, we've been discussing during this call to really cater to those particular consumers? Thank you. Andre Schulten : Nick, on the first part of the question, I can't really give you a number, it's impossible to estimate I can give you anecdotal evidence of what we're seeing. When you think about Oral-B iO, for example, $299 Toothbrush, very premium item. And obviously, we're impacted by the chips shortage just as everybody else. And we the demand, the consumer demand for that product, despite the price point is significantly higher than anything we can deliver. That's probably on the extreme end, because for chips, there's limited alternatives available. But there is some impact, it's just not possible to give you a meaningful number at this point. Jon Moeller : But directionally Nick, which is what leads you to your question, there is no doubt. At present, the demand is stronger than supply. Andre is absolutely right. I don't know how to quantify it either. But as we address some of the opportunities, and that's how I view it within the supply community there should be upside beyond kind of our internal forecasts and what you might expect. That's assuming, of course, that demand continues at current levels. Relative to Gen Z consumers, and you proffered several avenues to reach and delight those consumers, I think, all are on the table. There's another group of consumers that we're working to expand our coverage to, and we're frankly underdeveloped. And that's the multicultural consumer and the U.S. as an example. The good news is, these are the same consumers, the multicultural consumer, or the Gen Z population is multicultural by definition. So in terms of having a size of prize here, that's that merits consideration of all the choices you mentioned. It's significant, and we're all over it. Operator : Next question will come from the line of Peter Grom with UBS. Peter Grom : Hey, good morning, everyone. So I was hoping to dive into the updated commodity outlook a bit. I know there are a lot of moving pieces here. And Andre, you mentioned, chemicals and diesel are moving higher. But you also say that you're not really seeing relief across the other buckets. So just we would be curious, like, what are you seeing in commodities like pulp and resin, which seems to be trending marginally lower, at least versus where we more back in September, and October? And then maybe building on that just on the phasing of gross margin in the second half building on Steven and Jason's questions earlier, maybe I'm reading too much into it, but your responses imply that 332, gross margin will be under pressure, but an improvement sequentially as pricing bills, productivity brands and cost pressures are in the base and, and based on where things stand now that you could return to gross margin expansion in fourth year. I know a lot can change over the next six months. But is that a fair read based on where we are today? Or are there other impacts? I'm not really thinking of that could impact that trajectory? Thanks. Andre Schulten : Yes, to begin with the commodity guidance. Within our guidance, we see 44% increase across all commodity classes so if you take our total basket average, it is up 44%. Chemicals up the highest, no more than 60%, resins up almost 60% pulp up more than 30%, etcetera. So it continues down the line, all of these numbers are in that same range. And we see some reduction in resin prices, for example, or in Pulp prices from a temporary peak. But when we look at Q2 pricing relative to a year ago, resin last quarter or quarter, same quarter last year was $54, it's now 136. When you look about pulp, it's up more than 30%. So there is fluctuation in the short term. But the increases year-over-year continued to be continue to be very material. From a gross margin standpoint, I'll leave it at what I've said before, we'll see sequential progress in the gross margin driven by productivity, pricing and commodity costs coming into the base. I will not go beyond that in terms of giving a forecast just as too many moving pieces at this point in time. So I'll leave it at that. But we reiterate we expect sequential progress. Operator : Next we'll come to Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark Astrachan : Thanks and morning, everyone. I wanted to ask about the state of the consumer through the implied back half guidance. So you can get more pricing volume comparisons are easy. You raise sales guidance, but basically the level that you had achieved in the first half of the fiscal year. So I wanted to ask, what are the assumptions? Or what are your views of volumes, and just the general consumer outlook in your two key markets of the U.S. and of China? And maybe just to unpack it? One of the fears I think folks have is you're going to start laughing stimulus in the U.S. lower income consumer seems a little weaker, does that factor into your thinking there especially as pricing goes up. And then in China, there's obviously been lockdowns, there's Olympics, is that any sort of consideration as well in terms of your thinking about volume trends there and maybe a switch from traditional retail to offline or to online as well? Thank you. Andre Schulten : I'll start by saying the consumer continues to favor our brands. Our categories, again, daily use essential needs of the consumer and health, hygiene and cleaning. And the efficacy of our products and brands really helps us with the priority that we can provide to trade the consumer up within our portfolio. And as we take pricing, we see a lower reaction from the consumer in terms of price elasticity than what we would have seen in the past to give you some concrete data. In the U.S. we see on those brands where we've taken pricing in September and October, which are normally highly price elastic. We've seen price elasticity in the range of 20% to 30% lower than what we would have expected based on historic data. So we take comfort in the strength of our brands, the broad based growth of the portfolio globally, the broad based growth of portfolio across categories, and the short term reaction of the consumers as we take pricing and our ability to combine that pricing with innovation, which actually then stimulates the consumer to trade up in everything that we've seen. We assume, I think we hope that as some of the stimulus payments, phase out, labor rate participation will increase and hopefully one level of income will be replaced by another to be seen, but everything that we see at the moment. The combination of our categories being essential and relative consumer strength, give us confidence for the volume growth also in the second half. The only thing I will say on China. The elements that will help us here is hopefully with COVID easing and the regional lockdowns disappearing. That should be a positive driver of growth in China, but too early to confirm obviously. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Bill Chappell with Truist. Bill Chappell : Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just on the metric of 75%, superiority of your portfolio, obviously it's helped you immensely over the past few years. And in terms of kind of gaining market share or what have you, but I think we've been at 75% for about three, if not four years now. So just is that kind of the ceiling would be one question? Has the pandemic really slowed down your R&D pipeline, kind of with trying just to fill the supply chain, not wanting to roll out as many new products or, just any color around that? Is this as good as it gets? Or can we expect that to move to a higher number over the next few years as you kind of ramp up R&D? Thanks so much. Andre Schulten : I think the numerical stability of 75% might be misleading here, because it's not static at all. Once we reach in a category, call it 80%, 90% of superiority, we reset the benchmark to ensure that we look to the next frontier in terms of where the consumer would go, what really is relevant here for the consumer. So one example on single unit dose. For example, we've changed the benchmark from competitive single unit dose offering to actually test whether our Tide Pods are strong enough to incent consumers to trade up from liquid detergent to single unit oats. That's the new measure when you change that measure the percentage ink decreases, which is implied and is the intent. So the strategy of superiority is really dynamic. And if we were ever to reach 99%, we would have done something wrong, because we would have not looked at the external environment and as it evolves. Jon, anything you want to add here? Jon Moeller : Just to the point of Bill's question on innovation. We've called out many times our supply organization. Our innovation organization deserves tremendous credit. You don't contribute disproportionately to market growth across our breadth of categories. And as a result, grow share past three, six and 12 months, a nine out of 10 categories without an incredible innovation, capability and effort. And one of the first things we did as we were meeting every morning, literally daily, when COVID started was to figure out what were the health protocols that would allow us to get our R&D colleagues back in the office working together, collaborating, innovating and creating superior offerings as quickly as possible. And they've, it's it, there are certainly challenges. But they've done a tremendous job of keeping this pipeline intact. And I've never felt better about our innovation capability in our ability as Andre describes to keep raising the bar on superiority. Operator : The next question will come from the line of Chris Pitcher with Redburn. Chris Pitcher : Thanks very much for the question. Just going back to China, could you say in this environment, you're seeing increased local competition rather than just a softer market, and especially in reference to say skin, hair, and fabric? And if so whether this competition is more promotional led, as you may have suggested, or whether you're seeing an improvement in local product quality and functionality, and in the context of China looking to build its own domestic production capabilities of what can you just confirm what percentage of your sales are made in the mainland? Thanks. Jon Moeller : Almost all of our products that are consumed in China are made in China. Local competition is strong and continues to get stronger, which is a good thing. It's a constructive force in the market, it leads to market growth and expansion that leads to positive consumer experiences with a category or a segment. And it's something that we welcome. I don't have specific numbers for you in terms of progress of local versus international offerings, but that's current status. And I know it's not why you asked your question, but there have been understandably a fair number of questions on China. I would just draw your view as Andre said earlier, importantly, at any point in time, at any quarter, we're going to have challenges. Those challenges so far haven't led to major business loss. They've, they've led to grow slowdown in some cases which we've fully offset in other parts of the world. It's a pretty incredible feat. Sorry for the self-congratulatory tone. But I'm really congratulated in the broad organization to have flat growth in a quarter and your second largest market and deliver over 6% top line growth, it really speaks to the strength of the portfolio, the strength of the strategy, which I'll come back to at the very end of this call. Operator : And your last question will come from the line of Camilo Garcia Walla with Credit Suisse. Camilo Garcia Walla : Thank you, everybody. Good morning. Two questions. One following up on Mark's question about the state of the consumer. Obviously, it's healthy at the moment; your view is that continues to stay healthy. But can you talk a little bit about any guardrails you may have been placed in case that that changes quickly in case the impact of inflation really starts to turn on impact the consumer? Obviously there's stimulus, Child Tax Credit, these sorts of things. And then secondly, can you provide a little more detail on what pricing is going to look like outside of the United States versus domestically, specifically, so that as we start to see the data coming through in the coming months, we have a good understanding of what we're seeing here and how it may compare to what's happening elsewhere? Thank you. Andre Schulten : Yes, I'll start I'm sure Jon has a few points to add. On the consumer state, I think in terms of guardrails, what I tell you the strongest guardrails and mitigations we have are the strength of the portfolio. We're innovating across price tiers, we are building pricing out in a way that price tiers remain accessible for the consumer key cash always remain accessible. And so within the portfolio that we have, depending on the strength of the consumer, they will find an offering that matches their affordability level, their cash outlay level and still give them a superior performance versus the competitive PSS. Important to know that superiority does not mean that we're trying to trade up the consumer or trying to innovate only at the top end of the portfolio. Superiority is defined as Superiority at each price tier to the competing. So the price ladder remains intact and we innovate across and that's probably the best protection we can offer at this point in an inflationary environment. The pricing we take outside the U.S. is very similar to what you see in the U.S. broad range across categories. And about mid singles is what I will tell you. In addition to that we're taking pricing for significant variation [ph] in some markets, mainly Turkey to mention to recover short term margin there. But broadly, I would guide you to mid singles around the world on 60%, 70% of the portfolio, similar to what we have done. Jon Moeller : So I just have a couple closing comments; one on pricing. Remember, pricing is an inherent part of our business model. As an innovation centered company, we aim to create products that address better every day, consumer needs and problems and can typically command some pricing while increasing the overall value proposition to consumers with those more efficacious offerings. Pricing has been a positive component of our top line for 42 over the last 45 quarters and 17 out of the last 18 years. So while the level of pricing we're talking about here, to be fair, is typically a different level. This is not a dynamic that we're unfamiliar with. And as Andre said earlier, we certainly have significant historical and recent experience in developing markets. None of that's a guarantee, but this is not new territory. Last thing I want to leave you with there will be bumps in this road. There will be cases where we take pricing and we either encounter the consumer reaction that some of you are rightly looking to or a competitive reaction there is no doubt in my mind that there will be bumps in this road. But so far, it's going very well. Related to that there has never been more volatility that we're having to manage across the geopolitical spectrum or regulatory spectrum, the whole spectrum, the supply spectrum, the labor spectrum. So I guarantee you, as we said, in the last quarter discussion, that we will encounter sources of volatility and degrees of volatility that's sitting here today, we can't imagine. That's been true each day, week and month of the last two years. And so when you look at any one variable or one scenario, it's difficult to find relevance. My encouragement is to reflect back to strategy, portfolio, ability to execute. So identify those companies that will get through this the best, albeit with bumps on the road. And I think we've demonstrated thus far, incredible strength of portfolio of strategy of execution. And we're committed to keep that going. We're here the balance of the day, Jon is, Andre is and don't hesitate to contact us. Jon Moeller : Thanks, everyone. That concludes the call for today. Thank you for joining us. Have a great day. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to Procter & Gamble's Quarter-End Conference Call. Today's event is being recorded for replay. This discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from these projections. As required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the Company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business trends and has posted on its Investor Relations website, www.pginvestor.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Now, I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer, Andre Schulten. Andre Schulten : Good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Jon Moeller, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Chevalier, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. We will keep prepared remarks brief and then turn straight to your questions. This was another strong quarter, strong top line growth across categories and regions, sequential earnings growth progress in the face of significant and still increasing cost headwinds. Starting with a few highlights on the March quarter. Organic sales grew 10%. Volume contributed 3 points of sales growth. Pricing added 5 points as additional price increases began to reach the market. Mix added 2 points to sales growth for the quarter. These strong company results are grounded in broad-based category and geographic strength. Each of the 10 product categories grew organic sales in the quarter. Personal Health Care grew more than 30%. Fabric Care was up low-teens. Baby Care and Feminine Care grew double digits. Oral Care and Grooming up high singles. Home Care and Family Care up mid-single digits. Hair Care and Skin and Personal Care each grew low singles. Focus markets grew 9%, and enterprise markets were up 12%. In focus markets, US organic sales were up 11% on 7% growth in the base period. On a two-year stack basis, US organic sales up 18%. Focus markets in Europe were up 10% and Asia Pacific, up 8%. Greater China organic sales were down mid-single digits versus a comp period that was up 22%. Market conditions continued to soften in the March quarter due to COVID-driven lockdowns. In enterprise markets, Europe grew 18%; Latin America, up 16%; and Asia Middle East Africa grew 8%. Broad-based growth across geographies with six of seven regions growing organic sales high singles or better. Global aggregate market share increased 50 basis points. 36 of our top 50 category country combinations held or grew share for the quarter. Our superiority strategy continues to drive strong market growth and in turn, share growth for P&G. All channel market value in the US categories in which we compete grew nearly 9% this quarter. P&G value share continued to grow, up 1 point versus same quarter last year. Importantly, this share growth is broad-based. Nine out of 10 product categories grew share over the past three, six and 12-month period in the US and globally. Consumers continue to prefer P&G brands, recognizing the superior performance and value. On the bottom line, core earnings per share were $1.33, up 6% versus the prior year. On a currency neutral basis, core EPS increased 10%. Within the EPS results, we estimate Ukraine, Russia was a negative impact of about $0.01 per share. Core gross margin decreased 400 basis points, and currency neutral core gross margin was down 380 basis points. Higher commodity and freight cost impacts combined were a 490 basis point hit to gross margins. Mix was 130 basis point headwind, mainly from product form and pack size mix impact. Pricing and productivity savings of 260 basis points partially offset the gross margin headwinds. SG&A as a percentage of sales decreased 380 basis points due to strong top line leverage. Advertising investments remain strong as we continue to communicate the superiority and value of P&G offerings across price tiers. Core operating margin decreased 10 basis points. Currency neutral operating margin increased 20 basis points. Productivity improvements were 170 basis points helped to the quarter. Free cash flow productivity was 74% as receivables and inventories increased due to strong sales results. We returned $3.4 billion of cash to shareowners, approximately $2.2 billion in dividends and $1.2 billion in share repurchase. Last week, we announced a 5% increase in our dividend, reinforcing our commitment to return cash to share owners, many of whom rely on the steady, reliable income earned with their P&G investment. This is the [66th] (ph) consecutive annual dividend increase and 132nd consecutive year P&G has paid a dividend. So three quarters into the fiscal, organic sales up nearly 7% on broad-based growth across categories and geographies, solid global value share growth, sequentially improving EPS growth, strong cash productivity and an increased income commitment to owners of P&G shares. Moving on to strategy. Our team continues to operate with excellence and stay focused on the strategies that enabled us to create strong momentum prior to the COVID crisis and to make our business even stronger since the crisis began. We continue to step forward into the challenges and to double down on our efforts to delight consumers. The strategic choices we've made are the foundation for balanced top and bottom-line growth and value creation; a portfolio of daily use products, many providing cleaning, health and hygiene benefits in categories where performance plays a significant role in brand choice. In these performance-driven categories, we've raised the bar on all aspects of superiority : product, package, brand communication, retail execution and value. Superior offerings delivered with superior execution drive market growth. This drives value creation for our retail partners and build market share for P&G brands. Noticeable superiority is perhaps the most important in the inflationary environment we are potentially facing. A great example is the formula innovation we've launched on Tide and Ariel laundry detergents to enable superior cleaning performance in cold water washing. We're strengthening the communication of the cost benefits to consumers and the environmental benefits for the planet on the package and in our advertising. For consumers, the savings from switching from hot to cold washing can nearly offset the cost of Tide or Ariel liquid detergent in each load. The superior cold water performance is strong competitive advantage, enables immediate energy cost savings for our consumers and avoids the cost of rewashing, which may be necessary with less effective detergents. In addition, washing with cold water improves sustainability by reducing the energy required to heat water in the process and by improving garment lifespans. Superior innovation delivering multiple benefits and improved value for consumers, even while we price to offset a portion of the cost increases we are absorbing. We've made investments to strengthen the health and competitiveness of our brands across innovation, supply chain and brand equity. And we'll continue to invest to extend our margin of advantage and quality of execution, improving solutions for consumers around the world. Building on the strength of our brands, we are thoughtfully executing tailored price increases. We closed a couple of price increases with innovation to improve consumer value along the way. The strategic need for investments to continue to strengthen the superiority of our brands, the short-term need to manage through this challenging cost environment and the ongoing need to drive balanced top and bottom line growth, including margin expansion, underscore the importance of ongoing productivity. We are committed to driving cost savings and cash productivity in all facets of our business. No area of cost is left untouched. Each business is driving productivity within their P&L and balance sheet to support balanced top and bottom line growth and strong cash generation. Success in our highly competitive industry requires agility that comes with a mindset of constructive disruption, a willingness to change, adapt and create new trends and technologies that will shape our industry in the future. In the current environment, that agility and constructive disruption mindset are even more important. Our organization structure yields a more empowered, agile and accountable organization with little overlap or redundancy, flowing to new demands, seamlessly supporting each other to deliver against our priorities around the world. Going forward, there are four areas in which we need to be even more deliberate and intentional to strengthen the execution of our strategies. Leveraging environmental sustainability as an additional driver of superior performing products and packaging innovations, increasing our digital acumen to drive consumer and customer preference, reduce costs and enable rapid and efficient decision-making, next-level supply chain capabilities to enable flexibility, agility, resilience and a new level of productivity adapted to a new reality. And our employee value equation for all gender identities, races, ethnicity, sexual orientations, ages and abilities for all roles to ensure we continue to attract, retain and to develop the best talent. These are not new or separate strategies. They are necessary elements in continuing to build superiority in reducing cost to enable investment and value creation and strengthening our organization. They are part of the constructive disruption we must continue to lead. These strategic choices on portfolio, superiority, productivity, constructive disruption and organizational structure and culture are not independent strategies. They reinforce and build on each other. When executed well, they grow markets, which in turn grow share, sales and profit. These strategies were delivering strong results before the pandemic and have served us well during these volatile times. We're confident they remain the right strategic framework as we move forward. Moving on to guidance. We said each quarter that we will undoubtedly experience more volatility as we move through the fiscal year. We've seen another step in cost pressures, and foreign exchange rates have moved further against us. Transportation and labor markets remain tight. Availability of materials remain stretched in some categories and markets. Inflationary cost pressures are broad-based and continue to increase with little sign of near-term relief and have resulted in consumer price increases across CPG categories and beyond. The recent spike in virus cases in China and resulting lockdowns are affecting consumption and have caused temporary work stoppages in our operations and those of our suppliers. These costs and operational challenges are not unique to P&G, and we won't be immune to their impact. However, we think the strategies we've chosen, the investments we've made and the focus on execution excellence have positioned us well to manage through these challenges over time. Based on the current spot prices, we now estimate a $2.5 million after-tax commodity cost headwind in fiscal '22. Since our last update, we've seen continued cost increases in nearly every type of material we use and in diesel and in natural gas. Freight costs have continued to increase. We now expect freight and transportation costs to be a $400 million after-tax headwind in fiscal '22. Foreign exchange rate has also moved further against us, since our last guidance. We now expect FX to be a $300 million after-tax headwind to earnings for the fiscal year. We are offsetting a portion of these cost pressures with price increases and with productivity savings. In the start of the fiscal year, we've taken price increases in each of our 10 product categories in the US. You may recall, it was one year ago, when we announced price increases in the Feminine Care and Baby Care categories. Over the last year, input costs have continued to increase substantially. And as a result, the Feminine Care business has announced an additional price increase in the US, which will be effective in mid-July. Also, as a result of these increased cost headwinds, we recently announced price increases on certain items in the US Home Care category that will be effective at the end of June and in the US Oral Care business that will be effective mid-July. As always, each category in each market is continually assessing the cost impacts they face and the potential need for pricing. If there are decisions to price, the degree and timing of those moves will be very specific to the category, the brand and sometimes to the individual SKU. This is not a one-size-fits-all approach. Also, just as we've done over the past year, we'll look to close a couple of price increases with new innovation that offers our consumers more value, continue to drive category growth and maintain our competitive superiority advantage. As we said before, we believe this is a temporary bottom line rough patch to grow through, not a reason to reduce investment in the business. We're sticking with the strategy that has been working well before and during the COVID crisis. Moving to key guidance metrics. We now expect organic sales growth in the range of 6% to 7% for the fiscal year, a two-point increase versus our prior guidance of 4% to 5%. Pricing was a sequentially stronger contributor to top line growth in the third quarter and will continue to be a driver again in the fourth quarter as we get the full effect of increases taken over the past few months. We are closely monitoring consumption trends for signs of changes. So far, elasticities have been in line or better than our expectations. Demand for our best-performing, premium-priced offerings remain strong as do our market share trends. On the bottom line, we're maintaining the core earnings per share growth range of 3% to 6%. But given cost challenges we're facing, we now expect to be at the low end of the range at 3%. Within this guidance, we expect an additional $0.04 per share of negative impact in the fourth quarter from higher costs and limited operations in Ukraine and Russia. The impact from commodities, freight and foreign exchange has increased significantly since the start of the fiscal year. Our initial guidance in July assumed $1.8 billion after tax or about $0.70 a share. This increased to $2.3 billion in our October outlook, $2.8 billion in January, now a $3.2 billion after-tax headwind to fiscal 2022 earnings. On an EPS basis, the headwinds are now approximately $1.26 a share or a 22% headwind to core EPS. So in the face of an incremental $0.56 per share of negative cost impact since the start of the year, we've held our going-in EPS range, and we've maintained strong investment superiority with new product innovation and fully funded advertising programs. Of note, the majority of the recent $400 million increase in cost and foreign exchange headwinds will impact us in the fourth quarter. We continue to expect adjusted free cash flow productivity of 95% for the year. We continue to expect to pay $8 billion in dividends and now expect to repurchase approximately $10 billion of common stock, combined a plan to return $18 billion of cash to share owners this fiscal year. This outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Significant additional currency weakness, commodity cost increases, geopolitical disruptions, major supply chain disruptions and store closures are not anticipated within these guidance ranges. To conclude, our business continues to exhibit strong momentum. And we believe P&G is well positioned to grow through and beyond the immediate issues we are facing. We will manage through the near-term cost pressures and market volatility with the strategy we've outlined many times. We'll continue to step forward toward our opportunities and remain fully invested in our business. We remain committed to driving productivity improvements to fund growth investments, mitigate input cost challenges and to maintain balanced top and bottom line growth. With that, we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks so much and good morning. Andre, curious this quarter's revenue numbers surely show that there isn't really much that's happening in the way of trade down, and you just commented on elasticity. But I just was curious kind of what, if anything, P&G is doing to prepare for what feels like an inevitability for consumers becoming more sensitive to the pricing that is prevalent not just in your products, but across everything that they need to buy. So anything that you guys are doing proactively to help mitigate or think ahead to when trade down or substitution may become more of a factor? Thanks. Andre Schulten : Sure, morning, Lauren. Yeah, so as you said, in the data at this point, we continue to see favorable price elasticities relative to historic elasticities we've observed. Elasticities are better by about 20% to 30% versus what historical data would have indicated. That's good. But looking forward, we certainly have our eyes wide open and watch for any change in terms of consumer behavior. And as we say, we prepare on multiple fronts. I think the first level of protection here is the portfolio we've chosen to play in. We've moved out of discretionary categories into categories that are daily use, health- and hygiene-focused, where performance truly drive brand choice. That allows us to continue to invest in superiority, which we are doing consistently. Even though we see cost pressures, we continue to invest in superiority in every category and every proposition. That is probably the best protection. And consumers are rewarding us with continued trade-in and continuous trade up, which you see in the share numbers to date. The superiority also allows us to translate product superiority, for example, into value superiority more directly for the consumers. So that's the second intervention I would describe. So we are more proactively turning true product superiority into value claims that we put on tech, use in our advertising. One example is the Ariel cold -- Ariel and Tide cold water wash that I have mentioned in the prepared remarks. There are other innovations like the ADW, the automatic dishwasher myth buster, stating that even with eight dishes, it's more efficient to use the dishwasher than cleaning the dishes under running water, the latest easy squeeze innovation on Dawn that allows the consumer to use every last drop without any compromise on performance. So those are examples that we're turning into value plays to have consumers understand more easily the value that is coming by using P&G propositions. We have intentionally built price levels in every brand and across brands to ensure that we have offerings for consumers. If they feel they are budget constrained, they can trade within the P&G brand offerings. So on diapers, we have multiple offerings, starting with Pampers Pure at about $0.40 a diaper, Swaddlers at $0.35 a diaper, Baby Dry at $0.30 and Luvs at $0.20. These price ladders exist in all categories and offer the consumer a choice within the P&G portfolio. We are also, which is part of our pricing execution, protecting key price points, key value price points for each offering. So consumers can choose different cash outlays as they shop based on their available cash at the moment of shopping. The last element, we intentionally built distribution across all channels and invested in all channels. And that includes channels that consumers that are more budget constrained would migrate to like hard discounters in Europe, like the dollar channel in the U.S., for example. So building distribution across those channels to be able to serve the consumer where they want to shop is the last element I would call out. So, all of those leave us in a better position than we've ever been to deal with the potential consumer that is more budget constrained. To-date, we're not seeing that come through. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Bryan Spillane : Hey, good morning everybody, and thanks for taking the question. So my question is about just the, I guess, the path to stabilizing gross margins in particular. And I guess if we look at the quarter, right, the pricing and productivity covered about half of the inflation, so if you take the mix effect out of gross margins. And so, I guess, as we're modeling going forward, what are the levers that are going to -- that we should look to, to stabilize gross margins? Will there be a lot more incremental pricing? I know you've talked a little bit about that in the prepared remarks, a step-up in productivity. Just trying to understand what the levers are going to be as we kind of look forward over the next couple of quarters on gross margins. Andre Schulten : Yes. Thanks. Morning, Bryan. You're right. Over the past three quarters, you see pricing and productivity continue to increase a bigger portion of the commodity, foreign exchange and T&W gross margin impact. In quarter one, this covered 37%. In quarter two, we covered, I believe, 43%, and now we're at 53%. So you see a bigger portion being covered over time\u2013 [via] (ph) those effects. We will continue to drive all three levers to recover the dollar impact of commodity cost increases, foreign exchange and T&W. Productivity will continue to play a significant role. We have a lot of runway left on productivity. And as the supply situation stabilizes here over time, we have more line time and more resources available to reinvest in cost of goods savings. And that will allow us to strengthen our productivity muscle here sequentially, hopefully, over the next few quarters. We will continue to drive innovation. We have prioritized innovation in our resource and line time allocation to ensure that we can continue to offer superior value to our consumers, which also enables us to take pricing and see these relatively benign elasticities at this point in time. So you continue to see us invest in innovation. With innovation, we will try to take pricing at a very granular level by market, by brand. A lot of the price increases that we have announced are yet to flow through. So you will see an incremental contribution to the top line and to gross margin recovery over the future. The other price increase is already announced, and we will have to carefully evaluate more opportunities to take pricing. It will take time to recover the full dollar impact. And as we said before, it's more important to us to support the business model, support innovation, support superiority, execute pricing in the right way and recover gross margin and cost impact over time versus rushing to do this faster. So, you should expect sequential progress. I won't give you a specific timeline. We will continue to use all three, productivity, innovation and pricing. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : Good morning. I was hoping to get a bit more detail on China. How much of the decline in the quarter do you think was specifically related to lockdowns and maybe the comp versus last year? And can you give us a bit more granularity on some of the performance by product category there? And any thoughts on China going forward with the continued lockdowns in April, and how the business is positioned going forward? Thanks. Andre Schulten : Yes. Thanks, Dara. Good morning. Look, China, the lockdowns had two impacts in China for us. One, on the supply side, we have two plants in the Shanghai area and the contract manufacturer. Those obviously were shut down for now an extended period of time. So we had to activate our business continuity plans to offset as much of that production impact as we could. And we're certainly seeing a significant impact in terms of consumer demand. About 25%, I think, was the Wall Street estimates of consumers are somehow impacted by lockdown. That is impacting our consumers' ability to reach stores, grocery stores, department stores. Even online shopping is significantly constrained due to the inability to deliver. So we certainly see a significant impact from lockdowns. Latest read of market size in our categories over the past three months through March was flat in terms of value in China. With the continued lockdown and the difficulties in the market, we would expect April to be flat to negative. In terms of category detail, Beauty is significantly exposed to China. As you know, a bigger part of Beauty is -- of the Beauty business is in China. SK-II continues to be under pressure due to the market effect and channel effects in China. So that dynamic has not changed. The longer-term story on China based on historical results, which has been extremely strong over the past three, four years, as you know, we've grown high singles, low doubles in China. We believe the market continues to be a very attractive market for us. We expect categories to return to mid-single, high singles growth. We have a very strong organization, a very strong supply chain, a very strong R&D organization in China. So we remain confident, and we will continue to invest to capture the growth in the future. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Rob Ottenstein with Evercore. Rob Ottenstein : Great. Thank you, very much. Just a point of clarification to start off. Can you tell us kind of what your pricing run rate was at the end of the quarter, given that the pricing was going in throughout the quarter and the year? I think you were at 5% on average, but just like to get a sense of what the run rate was. And then I'd like to dig in a little bit more on the state of the consumer. You mentioned that elasticities were 20% to 30% better than what history has shown. But the current conditions, we've never had these kind of current conditions before at least in anybody's recent memory. So I was wondering what your consumer panels are telling you about why the elasticities are better? Is it because of increased savings? Is it the low rates of unemployment? How much has maybe contributed to your superiority? Just trying to get a little bit better sense of your read on the consumer from your own internal research? Thank you. Andre Schulten : Okay. Thanks, Robert. So in terms of pricing run rate for the quarter, on average, we have a five point contribution to top line. As we said, pricing will continue to increase as more of the price increases flow through. So I would say exiting the quarter, I would see about a 6% run rate to top line from pricing contribution. So you will see more of the pricing that has been announced, and that will flow through in April for the flow through in quarter four. Pricing elasticities remain favorable. And within the portfolio that we offer to consumers, we broadly see a trade up into higher price propositions that offer better value and better product performance. So \u2013 and that explains the mix effect that you see in gross margin, where we see higher unit sales items being chosen with higher penny profit, but slightly lower gross margin. So consumers are trading into single unit dose detergents instead of liquid detergent. Consumers are trading into body lotions instead of Baby Dry in diapers. So we see consumers trading up even within our portfolio into higher-performing product propositions. The relevancy of \u2013 or the relevance of product performance in our categories, we believe, is the reason why consumers are not trading down. We've had an extensive period of trial during the early COVID phases, where consumers have traded into P&G. They've experienced the superior performance of our propositions. They've seen the relative value that we provide. Even though the cash outlay might be higher, they see the higher efficacy of the product and the benefit that they gain from it. And we've seen repeat rates reaffirming that. We believe that a good portion of the resiliency of our demand is driven by the superiority of the product and packaging, clear communication of the benefits basis, clear communication of the value, good retail execution and carefully crafted price increases that allow consumers to choose the cash outlay they feel ready to afford and to choose the brand and brand proposition that they are looking for. So I'll leave it at that. Jon Moeller : Hey, Robert, this is Jon. Just a couple of other pieces of perspective on this, and of course, it's a rapidly evolving situation, and this could change tomorrow. But if you look for data points to support Andre's comments on consumer resilience, you obviously see them within the internals of our income statement as you mentioned. Also, if you look at private label shares as a proxy for trade down, they remain below a year ago in the US for the past three, six and 12 months. They remain below a year ago in Europe for the past three, six and 12 months. And if you look at market shares across channels, Andre mentioned earlier that we're -- we've worked to improve our distribution in channels where consumers with more of a budget challenge are inclined to shop. Our share growth in those channels, entirely consistent with his points, are some of our highest share growth across retail banners. So in the dollar channel, for example, significant share growth. Again, we'll have to monitor this very closely. Things can change tomorrow. But as we sit here today, it looks like the moves we've made to focus the portfolio in daily use categories where performance drives brand choice and deliver on the performance aspect across the vectors of superiority and be very granular in our pricing executions is holding up. Operator : All right. Next question will come from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. My question relates to category growth rates, understanding the volatility of the environment. And I guess I'm coming at this from the angle, I'm trying to unpack the strength of the 10% organic sales growth in the quarter and just the areas of favorability versus your plan. We've covered a lot of this. Demand elasticity, clearly better. Trade up remains favorable despite the environment. You continue to gain market share, which is great, up 50 basis points globally, though, I'm less certain that degree of market share gain would be very different than your plan. And then we haven't touched on this on the call. I'm not sure maybe there is some degree of inventory rebalancing with the trade because demand has outstripped supply in recent quarters. So where I'm going with this and understand the volatility of the environment, has there been any material change in your view for the categories as you look across your geographies and you look across the categories that you participate in? And we're thinking about our forecast going forward, any material change to category growth rates based on what you're currently seeing? So your comments there would be helpful. Thank you. Andre Schulten : Morning, Kevin. Thank you. So category growth rates are holding up well. Fiscal year-to-date, global category growth in the categories we compete in is 5%. We expect that to continue at around 5%. Category growth in focus markets is 5%. Category growth in enterprise markets is 7%. So it's a strong 5% on a global level. It's fairly consistent. Enterprise markets have been growing past three, six and 12 at 7%. Focus markets have gone between 4% and 5% over the past three, six and 12 months. So if anything, in the most recent reading, we've seen strengthening of category growth. We're also pleased with the fact that we see P&G leading and disproportionately contributing to category growth in most of the markets we're competing in, via innovation and via leading innovation and thereby driving category growth and participating in that category growth via share growth. So overall, we feel good about the level of category growth. We're seeing slight acceleration across the periods P&G contributing via our strategy of driving market growth, via superiority investment and innovation. And that certainly is benefiting our growth and is in line with our growth model we want to drive because the only way to sustainably grow at these level's by driving market growth and then participating in that growth via shared growth. Jon Moeller : Yes. Market growth is something that doesn't happen to us. We need to positively impact it ourselves, which is exactly what Andre just said. And that's what we're trying to do through our strategy. I would also say, Kevin, that if you look at the last quarter, there are several negatives within the quarter from a top line standpoint, several challenges that we've been working against. We've talked about China, our second-largest market, down mid singles. We've talked about the unfortunate situation in Russia and the Ukraine. One thing we haven't talked about, except indirectly, is that we're still racing to catch up with demand in our largest market, the U.S. But we're not fully supplying the market's demand. And all of those, hopefully, over time or some of them at least offer even additional upside as they reverse themselves. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Raymond James. Olivia Tong : Great. Thank you. Just a little bit of a follow-up there. Could you just talk a little bit about where the supply constraints are most acute and where you're starting to see potentially some more capacity coming back across the category, particularly amongst private label players? You mentioned pricing in Feminine Care, Home Care, Oral Care. Can you talk about -- a little bit about your decision as you consider future rounds of price increases and what categories you could potentially -- how you think about what categories you could potentially move on further? Thank you. Andre Schulten : All right. Morning, Olivia. Supply constraints, maybe to start at the global level, supply constraints are only present in every potential bucket that you can think through. Being able to source raw and materials is still difficult in sufficient quantities. Getting raw and packed materials to the places we need to get them to continues to be costly and highly volatile. Labor availability is certainly a stretch, not for P&G directly, but more for our supplier base. And then getting finished product out to our retailers by being able to actually ship with truck availability in the U.S., for example, is difficult. So it's across all aspects of the supply chain. We are making progress. Our on-shelf availability continues to be stable at around 93%, 94% even as we grow at these levels that we are happy to report we're growing at in Q3 and fiscal year-to-date. We have more and more categories coming off managed supply in the US over the next two months. So we are carefully working with our retail partners to ensure that we do this in the right way to ensure best service and best on-shelf availability with our retail partners. And we're making progress. Heavy -- the most investment in terms of capacity will be in our North America and European markets to ensure that we have sufficient capacity to keep up with increased demand we've seen. Those investments will take hold over the next two years. But we expect to be in a better situation over the next, call it, three to six months, specifically in the US moving out of managed supply. There is no -- to your second part of the question on pricing, I -- there is no formula-based approach to pricing in any of these categories. So we're carefully watching number one, consumer behavior and the strength of our superiority relative to the market. We are looking at the cost pressures and cost headwinds that we are seeing. And you will have noticed that in our paper categories in Fem Care, in Baby Care, in Family Care and in our Fabric & Home Care categories, that's where we see the biggest impact from commodity cost increases, transportation warehouse, but also foreign exchange impacts. So the impacts are bigger. There is superiority, and then it becomes a matter of, do we have the right innovation available, or do we feel that it is right at this point in time to recover via pricing versus leveraging productivity and the balance between those three elements as we've talked before. So I wouldn't say there's any formulaic approach. But certainly, Fabric & Home Care and the paper categories are most exposed to the cost pressures. So, the combination of all three elements needs to play out more aggressively in those categories than maybe in some others. Jon, anything you want to add? Jon Moeller : No, I think you've covered it. And Olivia, first of all, it\u2019s great to hear your voice again. And obviously, we can't provide any more granularity than Andre already has in terms of where price -- future price increases would occur. That's not something that's legally permissible. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citi. Wendy Nicholson : I guess not to beat a dead horse, but just to follow up on that point, as you think about the priority for the P&L, in those categories, I mean, I look at paper, I look at laundry or fabric. Those are categories where there is just to start with, maybe more competition, maybe less brand loyalty, maybe a little bit more private label just to start with, even though private label may not be gaining share yet. And so I'm wondering, if your priority is to offset commodity headwinds as much as you possibly can to preserve gross margin, or is it to preserve market share at this point? And then relatedly, you haven't really talked that much about currency and what you're doing in some of the bigger emerging markets, not even just emerging markets, but Japan, for example, where currency is a significant headwind. Are you adopting a different stance with regard to taking prices to offset currency headwinds? And are you seeing any differences in elasticity maybe in some of those emerging markets? Thanks so much. Andre Schulten : Okay. In terms of priority, our priority remains a reasonable recovery time on the dollar impact of commodities, foreign exchange and T&W headwinds across all categories. We will do this in a way that provides value to the consumer, provides a superior proposition to the consumer by combining it with innovation. There is no time line for us that forces us to recover gross margin over a certain period of time. We want to return to margin expansion, and we will. Our balanced growth model requires us to drive top line, bottom line but also reasonable margin expansion. So there is continued commitment to return to that point, but we will do it in a way that provides the right value to the consumer in every brand in every market at any given point in time, so we can serve consumers in the best way possible and maintain business momentum. To your second question on foreign exchange rate pricing, across markets, foreign exchange rate pricing is a reality we're dealing with every day, we've been dealing with for years. Nothing different to report in terms of elasticities, it's being executed in some markets, more pronounced. You've seen us taking significant price increases, for example, in Turkey, significant price increases in Argentina. So those are being executed. The organizations know very well how to do those, and they are baked in our forecast and guidance. Jon Moeller : So just one other point, Wendy. You asked \u2013 the question that you asked is the question that we get asked by the organization every day, which is which of these matters most, essentially top line and continued share progression or bottom line and earnings recovery. And the answer always is both. It's Andre's balanced point. We need to do both or we get out of balance, and the wheels come off. So we need to continue, and we'll continue to invest in top line momentum as we recover the commodity costs through combination of pricing, productivity, et cetera. So that's \u2013 it's both. Operator : All right. The next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Nik Modi : Yeah. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask a different slant to the premiumization and trade-down question, not necessarily on trade down, but just slowing momentum of premiumization because during the pandemic, you had a lot of low-income consumers with all that extra stimulus money engaging more in premium price tiers. So I was just curious on your observations on that. Kind of how do you think that's going to manifest in terms of that particular income strata and how they're behaving with food and gas inflation the way it is? Thank you. Andre Schulten : Yeah. Good morning, Nik, look, we're not seeing it. We've seen consumers trade into P&G brands and trade up within the P&G brand portfolio throughout the pandemic. Every quarter this fiscal year, we've seen consumers continue to trade up within the P&G brand portfolio into higher premium propositions across most categories. That's the mix effect you've seen on the gross margin and the positive mix effect on sales. So we continue to see consumers stay within the P&G portfolio and many consumers actually trading up within the P&G portfolio as they see the benefit of those higher premium propositions. As we've said before, we don't take that for granted. We don't assume that what we're seeing to date is necessarily an indication of what will happen in the future. We are very well aware that consumers might end up looking at budget constraints. Where we see, for example, private label losses reducing, we continue to see P&G growth. So even private label coming back so far is not impacting P&G's ability to grow within those markets or within those market category combinations. Our best defense to serve the consumer in a more budget constrained environment, other point we've talked through from the portfolio focus that we're operating to superiority to value plays, cash outlay choices, price ladder choices, distribution across our channels. So I come back to those elements that we control. That will serve us well, I believe, even for consumers that are more budget constrained and looking for choices. Jon Moeller : There are a lot of mileage benefits in some of the higher-priced products that we need to proactively communicate, as Andre mentioned earlier. That -- the assumption that just because something is higher priced, it costs me more per job is not a valid assumption, and we have to help people understand that. Operator : All right. Your next question will come from the line of Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Chris Carey : Hi. Good morning. I wanted to ask a question about the Personal Health Care business. Organic growth over 30%, certainly impressive. I appreciate there's a dynamic here where there's some recovery from like basically a non-existing cold, flu, but also conscious that this is one of those categories where you're particularly focused, and there's been some innovation. I wonder if you can just comment on how much of the strength in the business which is recovery versus things you're doing a bit more offensively that have a bit more legs long term? And just connected to that, fiscal Q4 implied organic sales guidance is for strength but deceleration on a two-year stack. And I wonder if you're baking in any normalization there or if there's other puts and takes that we should keep in mind? Thanks. Andre Schulten : All right. Thanks, Chris. PHC had a fabulous quarter, as we point out. Part of that certainly is the stronger cold, cough and flu season. It's 57% stronger in our estimation than last year's season, which was abnormally low driven by the mask mandates and everything else going on, a slightly stronger season than average by about 4%. But importantly, North America Vicks, for example, was able to outpace that season growth, plus 123% growth versus the season, which drove about 1.9 share points over the period. So within respiratory, season recovery is certainly a big point, but mix growing ahead of the season recovery and building share. The growth is also broader than just respiratory. Digestive organic sales are up mid-teens, and fleet is up nearly 30%. So the breadth of the portfolio is performing even beyond just the season recovery. So we continue to be very pleased with the results of the PHC portfolio and certainly see significant future runway there. On quarter four, sales guidance, the only thing I would say is as we mentioned before, we do not assume the favorable price elasticities to hold. In our forecasting, we assume price elasticity is to return to normal levels that we've seen historically. That's the only thing I'll let you know. And the rest, I think, is fairly clear. Operator : The next question will come from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse. Kaumil Gajrawala : I'd like to maybe just follow-up on a comment from earlier on sequential gross margin improvement. Was that a -- just a general comment on something that you expect over time, or are you kind of indicating that gross margins we see today are trough margins in 4Q, and as we get into the beginning of the next fiscal year is when we'll start to see it? Andre Schulten : General comment over time, Kaumil. We're not forecasting gross margin or gross margin guidance here, too many moving pieces. But over time, we remain committed to building gross margin as part of the balanced growth model. Kaumil Gajrawala : Got it. Thank you. Operator : The next question of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark Astrachan : Yes. Thanks and good morning everybody. I wanted to ask specifically a bit more about Beauty. So volumes negative. I guess I was curious, how much of it is category shift? It seems a bit away from Skin Care given pandemic effect there into some more discretionary categories. How much is market share challenges for SK-II around Asia and China specifically? And how do you think about how much of what I just said could be transitory versus needing more change from your standpoint to improve trends? Thank you. Andre Schulten : Yes. Thanks, Mark. We're very confident in the Beauty portfolio. If you look at the performance of this portfolio over the past five years, it's been just outstanding, right? The core portfolio has grown sales more than $3 billion over the past five years, profits more than $1 billion, significant shareholder value creation and 26 quarters of uninterrupted growth. So the core portfolio has been performing extremely well. And as you say, there are a number of headwinds that we see as temporary. China and the dynamics in China certainly being one of those significant dynamics, which is impacting the broader Hair Care and Skin Care portfolio, but also the broader impact on SK-II as it comes to the travel retail shutdown during the COVID period and the impact of China on the SK-II consumption with department stores being closed down and even some of the online business being hampered. So there are a number of temporary effects that we see. We -- you have seen us announce a few portfolio additions, acquisitions over the past months that are focused on the premium and super premium segments in the category. We believe that's a growth opportunity beyond the core portfolio in specialty channels. So we've proven that strategy with previous acquisitions like First Aid Beauty. And so we want to build out the portfolio in the premium and super premium segment in addition to restrengthening the core. So there's certainly work to do to address the opportunities in China on the core business, rebuild strength and momentum on SK-II and further help our business to serve premium and super premium consumers and specialty channels in the US and outside the US. But we're very confident in the core focused portfolio and some targeted additions via acquisition that we tucked in, which set us up for future growth in the Beauty category. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Peter Grom with UBS. Peter Grom : Hi good morning, everyone. So in the release, there were a few comments around lapping pandemic-related consumption. And I think you called out appliances and cleaning specifically. I just would be curious, when you look at performance in those categories, how does the recent performance compare versus your expectations? I guess what I'm trying to understand is, are you seeing a normalization that is in line with your expectations in some of those categories that saw significant growth over the past couple of years, or has demand held up better or been worse than you would have anticipated? Andre Schulten : Yes, I can start Peter, and then maybe Jon wants to add a few points here. But overall consumption is holding up. As I mentioned, market growth, 5% of focus markets, 7% in enterprise markets. That's certainly an indication that overall consumption in all categories is holding up well. There are some natural -- not natural, but logical switches. So when we think about, for example, our Grooming business, the Appliances business has experienced significant growth during the pandemic as more and more jobs that were done in salons and barbershops moved in-house. So folks -- people bought these appliances, experienced the fact that they can do the job themselves, and they continue to do so. But once that need is satisfied, appliances sees a decline versus that peak in terms of incremental job growth and incremental overall growth. At the same time, there's a natural hedge within the Grooming portfolio. So blades and razors were under pressure, as more people work from home and stayed at home. With reopening, that part of the category resumed growth. So there's a hedge component within Grooming, for example. Within anything that is health and hygiene related, I think consumers continue to put more emphasis on jobs to be done. They spend more time at home. So we continue to see our categories to benefit from both effects. Paper towel consumption continues to be increased by more than 10%. We'll see where bath tissue ends up once supply is unconstrained, but more time at home certainly would speak to more in-home consumption versus away-from-home consumption. The only part where we saw a little bit of a decline was anything that has to do with household -- surface disinfection, surface cleaning. That's a relatively smaller part of our portfolio. But as consumers get more used to the right balance there, we saw a little bit of a decline. But overall, all categories still benefiting from more time at home and higher focus on health and hygiene and certainly Beauty and Personal Care-related categories benefiting from reopening. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you. I was hoping, if you can please comment on the Baby, Feminine Care and Family Care. Seems that you continue to regain share in the US and also potentially in China despite the challenges there. And similar to this question, you had an impressive growth in the cold and flu brand franchises. But you start to lap those comps there. So do you think the growth is still sustainable with the innovation you've made in other franchises in health care? Thank you. Andre Schulten : Yeah. Thanks, Andrea. So Baby Care share is improving significantly in Europe and in North America driven by major innovation that was launched in the market, both in Europe and in North America. We will continue to build on that share momentum. We will continue to drive superiority via incremental innovation, investment in brand communication, go-to-market execution. We've also been able to enter some new parts and grow some new segments within the Baby Care category. When you think about launches, for example, in North America, that's a category that has been relatively quiet, it serves children between 5 and 12 with all the night bed-wetting issues. And reentering that category with a creative and relevant proposition allowed us to grow the category mid-teens and at the same time, build an 8% -- 8% to 9% share position within the category. We continue to build share in pants. Pants is a trade-up category in Europe and an opportunity in North America that allows us to grow our position as well. So broad innovation in terms of true product innovation, but also new jobs to be done and communication. Fem Care, we are seeing big success in both adult incontinence, but also in the most premium propositions in Fem Care. The biggest growth, for example, in Fem Care pads in North America is driven by Infinity, our most premium proposition, which is a unique proposition from P&G form based pad, delivering superior comfort and absorbency. Again, same formula, significant \u2013 significantly innovating in relevant ways for the consumer, investment in communication, retail execution allows us to drive overall market growth and share growth. On cold and flu, I don't have much more to add, Andrea, versus what we said before. We are growing ahead of the segment in terms of respiratory with strong innovation in Vicks. And we are growing the balance of the portfolio in terms of absolute sales growth and share growth, be it sleep or digestive. So overall, we feel there's significant runway left on our PHC portfolio, and it's playing out in the market. Operator : And your final question will come from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge. Jonathan Feeney : Thanks very much. I give you a lot of credit. I mean, there hasn't been a lot of discussion about retailer pushback to pricing. And maybe that's just because the results are good overall. But just looking at the US market, why is it that your relationships with retailers seem so good that elasticities are better? It's really a consumer level discussion. And do you expect that to continue? Can you give me any color around why that particular -- is it maybe just simply that they're short product, and there's more demand versus supply, so you're kind of in the driver's seat? What allowed this pretty good series of very good relationships to emerge? And what the -- how sustainable do you think that proves if we need another round of significant pricing second half of the year? Thanks. Andre Schulten : I'll start, and I'm sure Jon has a few points to add here. But generally, discussions with retailers work better if your business comes from a position of strength. Consumers are looking for your propositions. Velocity at shelf is strong. You have innovation programs that are credible and tangible and meaningful for consumers. You have in-store programs that are meaningful for retailers and consumers. You have an ability to communicate and support the advertising, both in digital as well as in mass advertising. And all of those things hold true as we entered this commodity inflation cycle. P&G came from a relatively strong position in terms of superiority. We continue to invest in innovation. Products on shelf, we're doing well. And that sets up a good discussion with retailers about future growth potential, the need for pricing, which is very clear, given the inflation cycle and the reality that it's broad-based within multiple industries. No guarantee that, that will continue. It will also -- it will always be, as we said before, a very careful balance for us between productivity, innovation and pricing. Jon Moeller : Yeah. Our retail partners are also competitors in most cases, with their own label offerings. And because the increases and costs are so significant, they need to be able, in most cases, obviously, entirely at their discretion, but they need to be generally able to raise pricing on their own brands. And when that's true, that becomes less of an issue, not a non-issue, but less of an issue for us. And I think the biggest change that's occurred over the last several years in our dialogue has been a more deliberate and overfocus on our part on market growth and on being -- and a commitment to be a disproportionate contributor to market growth. At the end of the day, a retail partner doesn't care what our share is. What they care about is what their sales are and are they growing or not. And we need to be a source of that growth. And when we do that dependably and reliably, as Andre said, it changes the nature of the conversation. And that becomes the focus of the conversation as opposed to other things. We have an opportunity in better serving our retail partners with supply as we've talked about several times, and we're working to address that. That's important in terms of continuing to serve them effectively. But that contribution to market growth sustainably and dependently changes world. Andre Schulten : All right. I think that concludes the call. Thank you for spending time with us today. John Chevalier and I will be available all day if you have any other questions, so please feel free to call. You know where to find us. Have a wonderful rest of the day. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning and welcome to Procter & Gamble's Quarter End Conference Call. Today's event is being recorded for replay. This discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections. As required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business trends and has posted on its Investor Relations website, www.pginvestor.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Now I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer, Andre Schulten. Andre Schulten : Good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Jon Moeller, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Chevalier, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. I'll start with an overview of results for fiscal year '22 and the fourth quarter. Jon will add perspective on our strategic focus areas. We'll close with guidance for fiscal '23 and then take your questions. Fiscal 2022 was another very strong year. Execution of our integrated strategies continues to yield strong sales, earnings and cash results in an incredibly difficult operating environment. We delivered broad-based strong top line growth across categories and regions, earnings growth in the face of significant cost headwinds, continued strong return of cash to P&G shareowners. Organic sales for the fiscal grew 7%, up 13% on a two-year stack, up 19% on a three-year stack. Growth was broad-based across business units with all 10 of our product categories growing organic sales. Personal Health Care grew 20%. Fabric Care and Feminine Care grew double digits; Baby Care, up high single digits; Oral Care and Grooming, up mid-single digits; Hair Care, Home Care, Skin and Personal Care and Family Care each grew low singles; Focus Markets were up 5% for the year; Enterprise Markets, 10%. We delivered strong results in our largest and most profitable market, the United States, with organic sales growing 8%, up 16% on a two-year stack. E-commerce sales increased 11%, now representing 14% of company total. Our integrated strategies continue to drive strong market growth, and in turn, share growth for P&G. All channel market value in the U.S. categories in which we compete grew approximately 6% in fiscal '22. P&G value share continued to grow, up 90 basis points for the year. Global aggregate market share increased 50 basis points. 36 of our top 50 category country combinations held or grew share for the year. Importantly, this share growth is broad-based. Nine of 10 product categories grew share globally over the past year. Core earnings per share grew 3% for the year despite a 22 percentage point headwind to earnings from commodities, freight and foreign exchange. Our initial outlook predicted $1.8 billion after tax of headwinds. We ended up at $3.2 billion. So despite an incremental $1.4 billion of earnings pressure versus ingoing plan, we delivered core EPS growth within our initial guidance range for the year. On a currency-neutral basis, core EPS was up 5%. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 93%. We increased our dividend by 5% and returned nearly $19 billion of value to shareowners, $8.8 billion in dividends and $10 billion in share repurchase. Moving to the April-June quarter. Organic sales grew 7%. Pricing contributed 8 points to organic sales growth as additional price increases reached the market. Mix was flat and volume declined 1 point, which is due to reduced operations in Russia. Volume for the balance of the business excluding Russia was up 1 point. These strong company results are grounded in broad-based category and geographic strength. Nine of the 10 product categories grew organic sales in the quarter. Personal Health Care grew mid-teens; Fem Care was up low teens; Fabric Care grew double digits; Oral Care, up high singles; Baby Care and Family Care, up mid-single digits; Hair Care, Home Care and Grooming, each grew low singles. Five of seven regions grew organic sales with Focus Markets up 3% and Enterprise Markets up 18% for the quarter. Organic sales in the U.S. grew 6%, up 24% on a three-year stack. European Focus Markets were up 3%. Excluding Russia, Europe Focus Markets were up 7%. Greater China organic sales were down 11%, mainly due to COVID-driven lockdowns in major regions of the market. Since lockdowns have eased, we've seen sequential market recovery but somewhat slower than expected when we gave guidance last quarter. In Enterprise Markets, each of the three regions grew organic sales 14% or more. Global aggregate market share increased 50 basis points. 29 of our top 50 category country combinations held or grew share for the quarter. On the bottom line, core earnings per share were $1.21, up 7% versus prior year. On a currency-neutral basis, core EPS increased 12%. Core operating margin decreased 30 basis points as gross margin pressure were largely offset by sales leverage and productivity improvements in SG&A. Currency-neutral operating margin increased 20 basis points. Free cash flow productivity was 99%. We returned $3.5 billion of cash to shareowners this quarter, nearly $2.3 billion in dividends and nearly $1.3 billion in share repurchase. In summary, we met or exceeded each of our going-in target ranges for the year, organic sales growth, core EPS growth, free cash flow productivity and cash return to shareowners, strong performance in very difficult operating conditions. Now I'll pass it over to Jon. Jon Moeller : Thanks, Andre. P&G employees have delivered great results over the past four years in a very challenging macro environment against very capable competition. In those four years, P&G people have added more than $13 billion in annual sales and roughly $5 billion in after-tax profit, executing our integrated strategies with excellence. I want to publicly thank our colleagues in product supply and R&D, who have enabled this progress with formulation, sourcing, manufacturing and logistics agility and extraordinary commitment to serve consumers, customers and each other through walk-downs, inbound supply shortages, outbound truck shortages, port blockages, natural disasters and geopolitical tensions. What P&G's people have accomplished together is truly extraordinary. Still, we're very clear-eyed about the trials ahead. The list of challenges we face heading into our new fiscal year is longer than any I can recall. The progress we've made and our collective commitment to our strategies give me confidence we can manage through these challenges. We've never been better positioned. A portfolio that's focused on daily-use categories where performance drives brand choice; superiority across product, package, brand communication, in-store execution and value; leveraging that superiority to grow markets and our share in them; creating business versus taking business; powerful with our retail partners as we work to jointly create value. We've developed a productivity muscle that helps address some of the challenges we face. We remain fully committed to cost and cash productivity in all facets of our business, up and down the income statement and across the balance sheet in each business and corporately. Productivity improvement is a necessity to drive balanced top and bottom line growth and strong cash generation. Success in our highly competitive industry and in this dynamic and challenging environment requires agility that comes with a mindset of constructive disruption, a willingness to change, adapt and create new trends and technologies that will shape our industry for the future. In the current environment, that agility and constructive disruption mindset are even more important. Our organization structure is yielding what we intended : a more empowered, agile and accountable organization with little overlap or redundancy, flowing to new demands, seamlessly supporting each other. This improved agility and accountability have been important enablers of our strong results in the dynamic environment we faced. Going forward, there are four areas in which we need to be even more deliberate and intentional to strengthen the execution of the strategy. The first is supply, improved capacity, agility, cost efficiency and resilience for a new reality and a new age. The capability investments we made prior to COVID to improve our manufacturing and distribution networks have helped us to manage through the last few years with relatively few prolonged issues. We're already making the next round of investments needed to ensure we have multiple qualified suppliers for key inputs, sufficient manufacturing capacity to satisfy growing demand and flexibility to meet the changing needs of all types of retailers. The second area is environmental sustainability, integrated into our product packaging and supply chain innovation work, irresistibly superior offerings that are sustainable. New cardboard packaging on Gillette razors is an improvement for the environment and a noticeably superior experience for consumers at the first and second moments of truth. New fully recyclable paper packaging on our premium Always cotton protection pads recently launched in Germany. Laundry detergent formulations that deliver superior cleaning in cold water, reducing energy usage, saving money and extending garment lifespans for consumers. Third, increasing our digital acumen to drive consumer and customer preference, reduce cost and enable rapid and efficient decision-making. Increased digitization on manufacturing lines, more use of AI, more use of blockchain are not ends in to themselves. There are tools we can use to delight consumers and customers at the most reasonable cost possible. Fourth, our employee value equation for all gender identities, races, ethnicities, sexual orientations, ages and abilities for all roles to ensure we continue to attract, retain and develop the best talent. By definition, this must include equality. To deliver a superior employee value equation, there must be something in it for everyone. These are not new or separate strategies. They are necessary elements in continuing to build superiority and reducing cost to enable investment to value creation and strengthening our organization. They are part of the constructive disruption we must continue to lead. The operational costs and currency challenges we faced over the last two years will continue in fiscal '23. We began the new fiscal year with consumers facing inflation levels not seen in the last 40 years. We know one of the most pressing questions out there is how we plan to deal with the severe cost and currency impacts we' re facing : $6.5 billion after tax in just two years, nearly an $8 billion hit to operating profit. I'll repeat what I said on our April 2020 earnings call : the best response to uncertainties and challenges we face is to double down on the integrated set of strategies that are delivering very strong results. It won't be easy. There will be bumps along the road, but we have the portfolio, superiority, productivity and in my not-so-humble opinion, the best organization in the world. We have everything we need. So again, I think we are very well positioned. We're committed to keep investing to strengthen the superiority of our brands across innovation, supply chains and brand equity to deliver superior value for consumers in every price tier in which we compete. Alongside our productivity work, we'll continue to offset a portion of the cost impacts with price increases. Whenever possible, we'll close a couple of those price increases with innovation. Those moves will be tailored to the market, category and brand. As consumers face increased pressure on nearly every aspect of their household budgets, we invest to deliver truly superior value in combination of price and product performance to earn their loyalty every day. So far, elasticities in most categories where we've taken price increases have been better than our historical experience. Our strategic choices on portfolio, superiority, productivity, constructive disruption and organization are not independent strategies. They reinforce and build on each other, and the four focus areas that I mentioned strengthen the execution of that strategy. When all of this is executed well, we grow markets, which in turn grow share, sales and profit. These integrated strategies are a pathway to delivering balanced growth. We've been talking about the importance of balance for a long time in the context of needing both top line and bottom line growth to deliver value for shareowners. We're in a world that needs more from us now. We need to expand that concept to serve and delight consumers, customers, employees, society and our shareowners. And I firmly believe that if we fail to do any of those, we will fail to do all of them. Our consumers increasingly rely on us to deliver superior solutions that are sustainable. Our world requires that we do our part in this regard. This challenge is also a wonderful opportunity to extend our margin of superiority, further grow our categories and create more value, all while positively impacting the environment and society. These strategies were delivering strong results before the pandemic and have served us well during these volatile times. We're confident they remain at the right strategic framework as we move forward. With that, I'll hand it back to Andre to outline our guidance for fiscal 2023. Andre Schulten : Thank you, Jon. As we've said in each guidance outlook for the past two years, we will undoubtedly experience more volatility in the fiscal year ahead. This rings true again as we enter fiscal 2023. The combined year-on-year profit headwinds from foreign exchange rates, freight costs, materials, fuel, energy and wage inflation are an even greater challenge in fiscal '23 than they were in fiscal '22. Based on current spot prices and supply contracts, we estimate commodities, raw materials and packaging material costs to be a $2.1 billion after-tax headwind in fiscal 2023. Freight costs are expected to be higher in fiscal '23 compared to the average cost paid in fiscal '22 by roughly $300 million after tax. Foreign exchange rates have moved sharply against us even since our presentation at the Deutsche Bank Conference in June. We now expect foreign exchange to be a $900 million after-tax headwind in fiscal '23. Combined headwinds from these items are now estimated at $3.3 billion after tax, roughly equal to the challenge we faced in fiscal '22, a 23 percentage point headwind to EPS growth or roughly $1.33 per share as we start the year. As Jon said in his review of our strategies, we're working to mitigate the impact of these cost headwinds through a combination of innovation to create and extend the superiority of our brands, productivity in all aspects of our work, and pricing. With this context, I'll move to the key guidance metrics. We expect global market value growth in our categories to moderate back towards a range of around 3% to 4% with strong price contribution offset by modest decreases in unit volume. With the strength of our brands and commitment to keep investing in the business, we continue to expect to grow at or above underlying market levels, building aggregate market share globally. This leads to guidance for organic sales growth in the range of 3% to 5% for the fiscal '23. On the bottom line, we expect EPS growth in the range of in line to plus 4% versus fiscal '22 EPS of $5.81. This guidance equates to a range of $5.81 to $6.05 per share, $5.93 or up 2% at the center of the range. Considering a 6-point headwind from foreign exchange, this outlook translates to 6% to 10% EPS growth on a constant currency basis. There are many possible scenarios that could cause us to be outside of this range to either side, high or low. While it's relatively easy to envision many possible scenarios, steeper inflation, deep recession, further geopolitical disruption or commodity cost reversion easing inflation, peaceful conflict resolution, it's very difficult to assign probability to any single scenario. As a result, we set the range we feel is most probable based on market conditions as we see them today. We expect adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% for the year. This includes a step-up in capital spending as we begin to add capacity in several categories. We expect to pay more than $9 billion in dividends and to repurchase $6 billion to $8 billion of common stock. Combined, a plan to return $15 billion to $17 billion of cash to shareowners this fiscal year. This outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Significant additional currency weakness, commodity cost increases, geopolitical disruptions, major supply chain disruptions or store closures are not anticipated within this guidance range. Now I'll hand it back to Jon for his closing thoughts. Jon Moeller : The macroeconomic and market-level consumer challenges we're facing are not unique to P&G, and we won't be immune to the impacts. We've attempted to be realistic about these impacts in our guidance and transparent in our commentary. As we've said before, we believe this is a rough patch to grow through, not a reason to reduce investment in the long-term health of the business. We're doubling down on the strategy that has been working well and delivering strong results. We'll continue to step forward toward our opportunities and remain fully invested in our business. We remain committed to driving productivity improvements to fund growth investments, mitigate input cost challenges and to maintain balanced top and bottom line growth. With that, we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] First question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Bryan Spillane : I just had a couple of clarification questions related to the guidance. And I guess the first one is -- just want to make sure I'm looking at this correctly. If I look at the implied step-up in the tax rate and then the share repurchases, they sort of offset each other. So seems like the underlying guide assumes that profit growth will equal whatever revenue growth is. Just want to make sure I'm understanding that correctly. Andre Schulten : Yes. Our core EPS guidance, as I said, in the range of flat to plus 4% with a tax rate slightly higher than what we've seen in the previous fiscal year. This is driven by geographic mix changes, and it's also driven by reduced benefit from stock option redemption. From an operating profit standpoint, you're in the right ballpark. And I would leave it at that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Stephen Powers : You both spoke a number of times, I think Jon reinforced it at the end of the prepared remarks, about the need to drive continued cost and cash productivity. As I reflect on fiscal '22, I think it's fair to say that the expense productivity was an area that came in a bit light of going in expectations, at least external expectations. As you turn the page to fiscal '23, and maybe this is embedded in the answer to help drive that operating profit growth you just talked about, Andre. What's your confidence, your line of sight to be able to accelerate productivity in the year ahead? That's my main question. If you could also comment on just the -- mix has been a very material driver of margin for a while now. And I'm just curious to see your base case of how mix impacts your margin outlook in '23 as well. Andre Schulten : Good morning, Steve. On productivity, you're right, it has to be a significant contributor to how we offset the inflationary cost impacts and enable reinvestment in the business in combination with pricing and innovation, as we said before. In fiscal '22, maybe let's go by area. From a cost of goods productivity standpoint, we've talked about us prioritizing production of cases to ship them and innovation as we were capacity-constrained. That has limited our ability to get cost savings qualified and through the P&L. That is changing in this current fiscal year. As the capacity situation eases, as we add more capacity and catch up with demand, we are able to get more cost savings qualified, catch up on some of the cost savings we delayed in fiscal '22. So we are expecting growth savings in the COGS area to get back to pre-COVID levels in this fiscal year. We are very confident in our teams. They are -- have an unlimited number of creative ideas to drive further productivity. That still obviously is needed to offset inflation, which is equally strong in the fiscal year. From a media standpoint, we have delivered significant productivity over the past years, but we have reinvested all of that productivity and incremental media spend ahead of sales leverage, ahead of the productivity numbers even that we generated. And that productivity continues to strengthen. We have developed strong capability to target better both on TV as well as in digital. Our ability to improve effectiveness of reach and quality of reach is allowing us to drive cost per effective reach down both in digital and in TV. We've shifted more and more spend into digital. Now more than 50% of our advertising is in digital. And with that, we are rolling out these capabilities to more and more businesses and more and more regions. That allows us to increase productivity on media spend in the current fiscal year to the point where we believe we will use some of that productivity not to reinvest fully but to actually flow through and help offset inflation. And some of that you saw in Q4 combined with other effects. General sales leverage and productivity on SG&A driven by sales leverage is well intact. You saw it flow through in quarter 4. That was 180 basis points helped to operating margin, and that should continue. So in summary, I feel good about our productivity muscle. It continues to strengthen, and it will be needed to help offset some of the inflationary pressures we see. On product mix, we continue to see the same effect that we've seen in previous quarters, which is a negative impact to gross margin, roughly 130 basis points on the quarter, positive impact when you think about our portfolio. What we see is that consumers that come into the P&G portfolio and we had big success in driving trial over the past two years. Those consumers, if they try P&G products, they tend to trade up. And that trade-up comes with increased unit sales. It comes with increased penny profit, but the gross margin is slightly dilutive. The example we use generally is Tide pods, about a 50% premium in unit sales versus liquid detergent per load, significantly higher unit profit, but from a gross margin percentage standpoint, slightly lower. So that same effect continues, and we expect that trade-up, hopefully, to continue in this fiscal. Operator : Our next question from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : I just wanted to discuss your level of visibility on the 3% to 5% organic sales growth guidance for fiscal '23. Obviously, there's a lot that builds into that, but I was curious for your perspective in a couple of areas. First, just the competitive environment. What are you seeing in your categories with a strong 8% pricing this quarter? Are competitors generally matching pricing in your categories? And then, B, you're only assuming modest P&G market share gains for fiscal '23 with the 3% to 5% corporate organic sales growth and 3% to 4% category growth. So can you discuss what's driving the moderation in P&G market share gains and how potential pickup in private label share might play into that and the fiscal Q4 results? Andre Schulten : Yes. Thanks, Dara. You're right. Our top line guidance is, as always, grounded in what we expect in the marketplace. We see moderation -- or we expect moderation in the overall value growth in the market from the 5% we had over the past 12 months back to 3% to 4%. And we expect pricing to be the main driver in that market growth with volumes slightly down. That is a logical consequence of the broad-based pricing that we are seeing in the market, assuming there will be elasticity. We've seen elasticity, albeit better than expected based on historical levels, but we're seeing elasticity in the market, and that's reflected in our market growth assumption. We have full confidence in our ability to compete in this environment. Our categories being daily-use categories that consumers don't deselect even when they see high levels of inflation, our focus on Irresistible Superiority, our ability to make strong value claims based on that superiority, the breadth of our portfolio across the price letter and value tiers and across channels positions us well to compete in the environment. And most importantly, the strength in our innovation portfolio and the runway we have in driving household penetration and trade-up within the portfolio has us focused really on driving market growth. And that inherently drives share growth for us. That's part of our assumption to market size and relative share growth. As to the private label point, we see private label reemergence in some categories, mainly in the paper categories in some regions. Broadly, what I would tell you at this point, while we acknowledge private label coming back, partly due to supply dynamics in the base, we are still able to grow share in those markets where we see private label coming back. In the U.S. in the recent period, private label coming up a little bit in Family Care. But overall, we've been able to drive share growth on an all-outlet basis. In Europe, private label shares are stronger. Private labels are reemerging in some of the markets. But for example, in the UK and France and Germany, we all have positive share reads in the most recent period. So we're keeping a close eye on it. But again, I want to bring it back to the strategy, the portfolio, the superiority, the innovation, and we believe we are well positioned and continue to be well positioned to serve the consumer in this environment. Jon Moeller : I just want to add one thing to that. Agree with everything that Andre said, both due to base period dynamics across ourselves and our competitive set and, as you said, Dara, due to many dynamics that are impacting both top and bottom line as we move forward. There will likely be more volatility in the numbers. There will be some bumps along the road. And you'll have to be careful how much you read into any one-week or four-week period. We've got our eyes focused on a longer time period than that, and we'll be managing accordingly. Operator : We'll go to our next question from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Two things, I guess, first is notwithstanding, Jon, your comments just now on scanner -- implied on scanner data. In the U.S., the market share performance has changed course. It's down slightly. It looks like a mix of things in terms of competitor supply perhaps coming back. But I was just curious if you could comment on U.S. market share performance in general was number one. And then number two was China, which I believe is 9% or 10% of your sales, down 11% is significant. I know that you've signaled previously that China was challenged because of the COVID lockdowns, but it does seem like it's disproportionate rate of decline versus what others are talking about. So if you could just talk to us a little bit about why your performance in China looks to be different than what we're hearing from some other multinationals. If it's specific to market share, if it's specific to mechanics of your operations? Just curious on some insights there. Jon Moeller : Let me just start in response to that question, Lauren, and then kick it over to Andre. We need to keep coming back to the strength of the top line. So in the U.S., for example, we grew 6% in the quarter, 8% over the course of the year. As you know, 7% total company, both on the year and the quarter. And that strength is broad-based. That's important. And we continue to protect project top line growth as well as modest share growth going forward. I'll ask Andre to provide specific commentary on China. Andre Schulten : Very good. Hey, Lauren, on the -- maybe I'll start quickly with the U.S. share, if you let me. You're right. If you look at the past one week and past four weeks, we see a kind of 10 basis point, 20 basis point decline. And that's -- as Jon said, there will be wobbles along the way. The base period is extremely volatile. If you look at absolute shares in the U.S., we're up over the last 52 weeks, last 13 weeks to the last one week, we continue to increase absolute shares. If you look at the periods that you're reading at the moment, just to give a bit more color, the two businesses that are down over this period are Fabric Care and Family Care. Just to give color on the period effects here and the wobbles. Fabric Care had an amazing run in the U.S., 11% up on the quarter, 12% up for the year and high tier -- low teens up over the past two years. And we haven't kept up with capacity and that came to a head in March. Just as we are installing and starting up new capacity, we were supply-constrained over the AMJ quarter. So we reduced merch investment, we reduced media investment because we just didn't have the cases. That is fixed in July. We're back in full supply as we started up new capacity, merchants reinstated, media reinstated. Family Care-based period, you know the situation in Family Care on supply has been very constrained. And again, you're reading mainly base period effects, not sequential share effects. All-outlet share in the U.S. continues to be up. So we feel very confident in our U.S. business overall. China, you're right. We have been significantly impacted by the COVID lockdowns. The read for us across our category footprint and regional footprint in China is that the market contracted double digits over the quarter periods that we're reading, and that is reflected in the results. More importantly, since consumer mobility started to resume, the COVID lockdowns are easing, we're seeing a return to growth in our categories. Our shares are responding favorably. So we're hopeful that we return to mid-single-digit growth in China over the next few quarters. Certainly, the team on the ground is excited, capable and has everything ready to go, but we need to see that consumer mobility come back. Jon Moeller : And Lauren, relative to your question on the relative share performance, where you happen to have manufacturing operations located has a big impact on your ability to supply the market. And we had -- we were pretty significantly impacted by the location of some of the shutdowns, namely Shanghai, where we have manufacturing centers and important contract manufacturer supply. So that's one of the reasons for some of the noise within the share comparison. Operator : We'll go to our next question from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Two questions. I guess kind of coming back to some of the topics that have already been raised. First on market growth assumptions, the anticipated deceleration, is this coming from an anticipation that consumers are going to use less so as volume comes in, trade down so mix comes in? Or maybe we lap some pricing and bring some more promotions back so pricing comes in? Which of those 3 components do you expect to be the bigger driver of category to sell? Andre Schulten : The -- it's a combination of what you described. As we said, pricing generally comes with a level of elasticity. Consumers don't leave the category, but they might look at their dosing behaviors. They might look a little bit closer at their inventories and draw that down over a period of time, specifically as they are more exposed to inflation broadly in the marketplace with the highest inflation in 40 years, it'd be naive to assume the consumer is not looking at their cash outlay and their spending even in our categories. Though we see the elasticities be more favorable than historical norms to date, we continue our assumption that they return to historical elasticities going forward. We hope that's not the case, but our assumption is that, that returns to what we've seen in the past. The other element I would point to is just normalization of consumption patterns. As we saw very elevated consumption growth over the last two years, some of that will, at a total market level probably return to more normal levels. Our job within that is for our brands and our categories to drive the household penetration opportunities, which we have. They are huge even in the most developed markets, even in the most developed categories, and that's what we're going to focus on. Operator : We'll go to our next question from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : My question is on potential implications from the fallout with Walmart and your bigger retailers more broadly feeling margin pressure. From a category perspective, it's sort of well understood the issues are more general merchandise and not consumer staples. But we have seen some ripple effects, right? They've announced freight fuel charges, which we have seen. So my question is really around any implications that you may be concerned about, whether more difficulty taking price, greater request for trade promotion. So any comments you have there in terms of what's going on with large retail customers would be helpful. Andre Schulten : Yes. Kevin, I'll start, and then Jon might want to add here. In general, we acknowledge -- as you said, Walmart indicated that the pressure they are seeing is in general merchandise and apparel. Our categories, when you think about the HPC categories broadly in Walmart and across all retailers in the U.S., really are still growing at a good clip. Our interests are generally aligned with retailers' interest as our job is to provide the best possible value to consumers as defined by price and performance of the product. We both want to drive footfall to the store. We both want to drive traffic to the shelf. We both want to drive consumption of our propositions. In that sense, we continue to work constructively with Walmart and with all retailers to do that in the best possible way. Our strategy, grounded in the categories we play in, that are generally not categories that consumers deselect even in difficult times, our superiority, our investment in innovation, our intention to drive category growth and to win with our retailers versus purely focusing on share growth, all of those are good things. In our mind, all of those are good things in the minds of retailers. The dialogue generally remains constructive but focused on providing the best possible value to the consumer. Operator : We'll go next to Rob Ottenstein with Evercore. Robert Ottenstein : Was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your price increases in July, maybe give a sense of order of magnitude and breadth, early reception. And then assuming the sort of elasticities that you expect, how far can those increases go to offsetting the $3.2 billion or $3.3 billion of headwinds that you outlined earlier? Andre Schulten : The increases we're taking, and we've announced in June, July, are going into effect broadly in this quarter, July, August, September, towards the latter half of it. They are across most categories in the U.S. And we also announced pricing globally in the same ballpark, mid-single digits, but very differentiated. So in general, I would tell you, mid-singles -- probably mid- to high singles, but really tailored by country, by brand, by SKU to ensure that we do what I just described retailers are looking for, provide the best value for their relevant shoppers in terms of absolute price point, product performance and value tier. The reaction to those price increases from a retailer environment is what you would expect. Nobody is pleased about the continued inflationary trends that we're seeing, but it remains a constructive discussion on how to best execute what we need both from a retailer standpoint and from a manufacturer standpoint, which is recovery of inflationary cost measures to the extent that cannot be covered by productivity. In terms of our ability to offset the latest inflationary trends across commodities and transportation, pricing is part of that. But the pricing we're taking is not covering the entire breadth of increases that we're seeing that needs to be a combined effort between pricing, innovation and driving trade-up via innovation and productivity. But we feel good about every part of that equation. Our innovation portfolio is stronger than ever. Our productivity muscle is strong, and pricing dynamics and conversations remain productive. Jon Moeller : Just one additional point, Rob, the -- relative to the competitive environment. We're seeing price increases on private label brands and on mid-tier offerings that are even higher in some cases than our own price increases. I just offer that perspective as it relates to the ability to hold pricing and what it might mean for market share. As Andre said, it's a fairly constructive environment. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse. Kaumil Gajrawala : I'd like to talk a little bit more about the $1.33. It's such a substantial amount of money between commodities and FX and what's incorporated in there, particularly, whether it's forward purchasing agreements, hedges, any of those sorts of things. And I'm asking for, I guess, an obvious reason, which is commodity costs very recently have come down. And I'm sure you don't feel the benefit immediately, but how should -- if this is to continue, which is possible, how should we think about the impact that's going to have on the estimates you've given us so far? Andre Schulten : Good morning, Kaumil. Yes. If you break it down, the $1.33, $2.1 billion of the $3.3 billion is driven by commodities, $900 million by FX and $300 million by transportation. On the commodity side -- so let me take each bucket here. On the commodity side, we've seen some of our commodities annualized, as you said, and maybe even decrease. But we've seen the majority of our commodity basket still increase week-over-week month-over-month. So when you look at our overall commodity exposure, it is at this point in time stable to increasing. And our assumption going forward is at spot rates. So we assume stability within the commodity price environment versus current spot. We do not hedge our commodities. We are counting on our offsets within our total exposure between commodity FX and interest rates. So spot is the assumption we are using. And we still see slight increases week-over-week, month-over-month, certainly not to the tune that we saw at the beginning of '22. On the foreign exchange rate, that is the fastest-increasing headwind, also a big headwind in quarter 4 that we had to overcome. The interest rate differentials keep widening versus the U.S. So we anticipate that headwind could further expand. But our forecast is based on current spot rate, so the same methodology as on commodities. Transportation is a rollover versus the average price that we have paid in '21, '22. We see a little bit of easing here on the rate side. If you look at the load-to-driver ratio in the U.S., for example, that's down from a peak of 12 to now 4, which is more normalized. And some of the spot rates are coming down. That hasn't rolled over into contract rates at this point in time. If that happens, that could be a tailwind. Ocean freight, you see the number of ships waiting to get unloaded is decreasing. So that's normalizing. What I'll offer as the offset obviously is energy prices, fuel prices. So this one might offer some relief. But again, so far, we see this offset by fuel cost. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Carey with Wells Fargo. Christopher Carey : So you noted that trade promotion was expected to be about $300 million after tax. I think you're referring to promotional spending, which is not an item, I think, typically, you call out specifically. So it does seem like you're indicating a more intentional desire to pick up promotional spending in order to help the consumer weather some of these cost increases. Is that a fair characterization? And then obviously, your price increases across much of your portfolio ahead. But are there specific categories or geographies where you specifically intend to lean in or where you think the consumer or the retailers need the most help? Andre Schulten : Good morning, Chris. On the promo side, I'm not sure we intended to mention any number. But let me describe where we are. But John Chevalier can certainly clarify afterwards, if that question remains open. Our promotion strategy remains the same. If you look at promotion levels, they are relatively stable. I take the U.S. as the market where we have the best visibility and you have the best visibility. We're running at about 27% of merch, so that's volume sold on deal, and depth combined. That compares to a pre-COVID level slightly above 30% to a COVID low at 16%. But that 27% has been relatively stable over the past few quarters. So there's no significant increase in what we're observing. We are not planning to increase significantly. But that, again, is a very tactical decision that is being made at the market level at the category level. But our intention to win is via innovation via clarity of value offer, via our superiority, not via price promotion. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : So my question is on RGM. I guess I'm not missing if you're prospectively or more reactively introducing new price points, perhaps type simply pulling some of these levers to help the consumer or if you're seeing basically the retailers, your customers requesting more of that help or that's too early to say. And if you can walk through what has happened with Beauty in China on new exits of the quarter. I guess that's one area that you could potentially see improvement there. If you can help us kind of like bridge that gap? Andre Schulten : Good morning, Andrea. On revenue growth management, that has been a priority for us, not only in the recent quarter but really over the past two to three years. So what we're benefiting from now was very intentional design of our revenue growth strategies over that period of time, including portfolio choices to have brand offerings available that cover different value tiers. When you think about diapers, for example, we have the premium-tier Pampers Pure at $0.38 per diaper, Swaddlers at about $0.35 a diaper, Baby Dry at $0.30 and Luvs at $0.20 a diaper. So that's one example. And this exists across really all brands. And we've been very intentional in building our presence in these different value tiers in the market, so we can serve consumers with different preferences between performance and price. We have also spent a lot of time and design effort in creating the right price points. And those price points relevant on everyday price but also providing the right merch price points for different channels. So that's work that's been going on in every category. And then lastly, we've expanded our distribution across channels that consumers would go to in a more value-driven environment, think about hard discounters or dollar channel, to ensure that we have strong relationships with our retail partners there, strong distribution and offerings. So that work, yes, is indeed very important, but it has been ongoing over a longer period of time. As we take pricing, we ensure that we protect that strategy very carefully. And that's why pricing is so differentiated between markets, brands, channels as we execute. On Beauty China, what I'll tell you is that we remain very confident that the Chinese market offers very attractive growth rates and very attractive value-creation opportunities for us. As mobility returns, as department stores reopen, as we develop stronger capability in digital channels, as we refocus our business on the core brand equities, we see progress. The progress is still relatively slow because mobility is only just reopening. But we remain very confident that, that business offers a lot of opportunity, and we are well positioned with our brands to play. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with Truist Securities. Bill Chappell : Jon, this may be a little bit of a softball question, but I think we've run out of ways to ask about pricing in the consumer. But in your prepared remarks and then also I heard you on CNBC this morning say, \"P&G is the best organization in the world.\" And I'm struck by that. In the 15 years I've known you, you've never been a cheerleader or someone to throw out superlatives. And coming on a quarter when technically, stock is down and you've missed, just why you feel that way now? Is the kind of turnaround or the catching of breath complete? You seem to want to get that message out there. So just anything more color you could give would be interesting and helpful. Jon Moeller : There's clearly a desire to recognize extraordinary effort and results on the part of our organization broadly defined. The challenges that have been overcome while maintaining or improving service to consumers, customer and delivering both strong top and bottom line results, that's just not an accident. And we've been trying to become even more intentional about the importance of our organization, of our employee value proposition and delivering and sustaining superiority over time. So it's just, Bill, a reflection of that reality and my confidence in this organization to continue to step up and step forward into the challenges we face and continue to deliver strong progress from a business standpoint. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Raymond James. Olivia Tong : I'll be quick, but just two quick questions. First, are there more price actions planned versus what's already been announced? Is there anything being contemplated or everything that's been announced has been announced? And then secondly, just if you could give some color on your innovation pipeline and how it skews this year versus previous years potentially. Is there more premium versus more value and how you think about it in terms of contribution to price and mix? Andre Schulten : Hey, Olivia. On pricing, my answer is going to be quick. What's announced is announced, and everything else we can't talk about. But it's going to be a combination of pricing, productivity and innovation. That's as much as I can tell you. And we're always evaluating pricing and the necessity for pricing in every market every day. So that's an ongoing discussion. In terms of innovation, fundamentally, our innovation pipeline looks out five years, 10 years. The innovation pipeline continues to be strong. It continues to drive superiority across the full portfolio because that's the definition of superiority. It's not just the premium end, and that doesn't really change. So when we talk Irresistible Superiority, we mean Irresistible Superiority at every price point for every product, for every consumer that we choose to compete for versus the relevant competitive offering. And that drives the innovation strategy and the strength of the innovation. I see it only improving and being broad-based. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark Astrachan : One question and just a clarification or a reminder. How -- can you help us on just the leverage that you get from an SG&A standpoint given the volumes that we've seen over the last couple of years and then put that in the context of the slight volume decline in the June quarter just as a reminder there? That would be helpful. And then more broadly, how do you think about the ability to sustainably invest given the exchange rates? And specifically, I'm talking about obviously dollar strength versus a lot of other currencies, especially given some of your overseas current -- overseas competitors who don't obviously have the translational impact. So how does that influence, if it does, your ability to sustainably invest and maintain those levels of investment going forward if the dollar remains where it is? Andre Schulten : Thanks, Mark. On SG&A leverage, so from a -- let me maybe start with the broader leverage point. So we generally see sales leverage when we see growth in the range of 3% to 4%, roughly. When we go north of 4%, the leverage becomes relevant and material, and that's SG&A leverage. So if we grow in line with our guidance range, that will provide a level of sales leverage similar to what we would typically and historically have expected. On the COGS side, you're right, the volume is the key driver for the leverage. With flat volumes, as we've seen in the fourth quarter, there obviously is no leverage. But that's where our productivity efforts are even more important. And that's why we're doubling down on our acceleration of productivity improvements. We'll talk about this more, I think, in our Investor Day, where we'll give you a bit more insight on Supply Chain 3.0 just to put more substance around the runway that we still have in driving productivity. That also is the answer to your second question because you're right, foreign exchange rate represents a significant headwind for us, might not represent that much of a headwind for some of our international competitors. We're well aware of that. We've been to this movie a few times. The answer to our question is strong growth, serving the consumer better than everybody else, delivering top line growth. That fuels our ability to invest in combination with strong productivity. So it reinforces our growth model. It reinforces the need for all components of the strategy to work. But I acknowledge foreign exchange rate is one of the more discriminating headwinds we have to deal with. Jon Moeller : Great. Thanks for joining us this morning. Just one item to note before we sign off. We will be hosting an Investor Day here in Cincinnati on the afternoon and evening of Thursday, November 17. We'll be sending out another save-the-date reminder in the next week. But if you like more details, please get in touch with the IR team. Thanks and have a great day and weekend. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

This discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections. As required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business trends and has posted on its Investor Relations website, www.pginvestor.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Now, I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer, Andre Schulten. Andre Schulten : Good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Jon Moeller, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Chevalier, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. We're going to keep our prepared remarks brief and then turn straight to your questions. Execution of our integrated strategies continued to yield good results in the July to September quarter and provides a solid start to the fiscal year. We're growing organic sales in all 10 categories, holding global aggregate market share, accelerating productivity savings, and improving supply sufficiency. Together, this progress enables us to maintain guidance ranges for organic sales growth, core EPS growth, free cash flow productivity and cash return to shareowners. Despite continued high commodity and transportation costs, inflation in the upstream supply chain and in our own operations, accelerating headwinds from foreign exchange, geopolitical issues, COVID disruptions impacting consumer confidence and historically high inflation impacting consumer budgets. Moving to the first quarter numbers. Organic sales grew 7%, pricing added 9 points to sales growth and mix was up 1 point. Volume declined 3 points, primarily due to lower shipments in Russia. Growth was broad-based across business units with each of our 10 product categories growing organic sales. Personal Health Care grew high teens. Feminine Care was up double digits. Fabric Care and Home Care were up high single digits. Baby Care, Grooming, Hair Care and Skin and Personal Care were each up mid-singles. Family Care and Oral Care grew low single digits. Focus markets grew 4% for the quarter, with the US up 5%. Greater China organic sales were down 4% versus the prior year, modest sequential improvement in the market still affected by COVID lockdowns and weak consumer confidence. Longer term, we expect China to return to strong underlying growth rates. Enterprise markets were up 16% with each of the three regions, up 13% or more. Global aggregate market share was in line with prior year, with 26 of our top 50 category country combinations holding or growing share. In the US, all outlet value share was in line with prior year with 6 of 10 categories holding or growing shares. On the bottom line, core earnings per share were $1.57, down 2% versus prior year. On a currency-neutral basis, core EPS increased 7%. Core margin decreased 160 basis points and currency-neutral core margin was down 130 basis points.  Higher commodity materials and freight cost impacts combined with a 550 basis point hit to gross margins. Mix was 120-point headwinds, productivity savings and pricing provided 580 basis points of offset. SG&A costs as a percentage of sales were lower by 90 basis points as sales leverage and productivity improvements more than offset inflation and foreign exchange impacts. Core operating margin decreased 70 basis points, currency-neutral core operating margin increased 10 basis points, productivity improvements were a 230 basis help to the quarter. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 86%, we returned nearly $6.3 billion of cash to shareowners, approximately $2.3 billion in dividends and $4 billion share repurchase.  In summary, considering the backdrop of a very challenging cost and operating environment, results across top line, bottom line and cash to start the fiscal year. Our team continues to operate with excellence, executing the integrating strategies that have enabled strong results over the past four years, which are the foundation for balanced growth and value creation.  A portfolio of daily use products, many providing cleaning, health and hygiene benefits in categories where performance plays a significant role in brand choice. The priority across the five vectors of product, package, brand communication, retail execution and value.  Productivity improvement in all areas of our operations to fund investments is a priority offset cost and currency challenges, expand margins and deliver strong cash generation. An approach of constructive disruption, a willingness to change, adapt and create new trends and technologies that will shape our industry for the future especially important in this volatile environment.  Finally, an organization that is increasingly more empowered, agile and accountable with little overlap or redundancy flowing to new demands, seamlessly supporting each other to deliver against our priorities around the world.  Going forward, there are four areas we are driving to improve the execution of integrated strategies : Supply Chain 3.0, digital acumen, environmental sustainability and employee value equation. These are not new or separate strategies. They are necessary elements in continuing to build the priority, reduce cost to enable investment and value creation and to further strengthen our organization. Jon touched on each of these in our July earnings call and they will be a central part of our discussion at Investor Day in November.  Our strategic choices on portfolios, priority, productivity, constructive disruption and organization are not independent strategies. They reinforce and build on each other, when executed well, they grow markets, which in-turn grow share, sales and profit. We continue to believe that the best path forward to deliver sustainable top and bottom-line growth is to double down on these integrated strategies, starting with a commitment to deliver irresistibly superior propositions to consumers and retail partners.  Now moving on to guidance, we fully expect more volatility in costs, currencies and consumer dynamics as we move through the fiscal year. However, we think the strategies we've chosen, the investments we've made and the focus on executional excellence has positioned us well to manage through this volatility over time. Raw and packaging material costs inclusive of commodities and supplier inflation have remained high since we gave our initial outlook for the year in late July. Based on current spot prices at latest contracts, we now estimate a $2.4 billion after-tax headwind in fiscal 2023. Freight costs have also remained high. Though we have seen some easing in spot prices, we've made a modest downward adjustment in our outlook and now expect a $200 million after-tax headwind on freight and transportation costs in fiscal 2023. Foreign exchange has continued its strong move against us as the US dollar has strengthened significantly against essentially all major currencies around the world. Based on current exchange rates, we forecast a $1.3 billion after-tax impact, an incremental hit of $400 million versus our initial outlook for the year. Combined, headwinds from these items are now estimated at approximately $3.9 billion after tax or $1.57 a share, a 27 percentage point headwind to EPS growth for the year. We will offset a portion of these cost headwinds with price increases and productivity savings. We will continue to invest in irresistible superiority, which is even more important as we compete in some markets with local or non-US based competitors that don't see the same foreign exchange rate impact. As we've said before, we believe this is a rough patch to grow through not a reason to reduce investment in the business. As I noted at the outset, our good first quarter results enable us to confirm our guidance ranges for the fiscal year, across all key metrics. We continue to expect organic sales growth in the range of 3% to 5%. On the bottom line, we are maintaining our outlook of core earnings per share growth in a range of in line plus 4% versus prior year. However, the steep increase in foreign exchange impact pushes our current expectations towards the lower end of the range. We continue to forecast adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90%. We expect to pay around $9 billion in dividends and to repurchase $6 billion to $8 billion in common stock, combined a plan to return $15 billion to $17 billion of cash to shareowners this fiscal year. The outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Significant additional currency weakness, commodity cost increases, geopolitical disruption, major production stoppages or store closures are not anticipated within this guidance range. To conclude, the macroeconomic and market level consumer challenges we're facing are not unique to P&G, and we won't immune to the impact. We've attempted to be realistic about these impacts in our guidance and transparent in our commentary. As we've said before, we believe this is a rough patch to grow through not a reason to reduce investment in the long-term health of the business. We're doubling down on the strategy that has been working well and delivering strong results. We'll continue to step forward towards the opportunities that we may fully invest in our business. We remain committed to driving productivity improvements to fund growth investments, mitigate input cost challenges and to maintain balanced top and bottom line growth. With that, we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Steve Powers : Yes, hi good morning. Thanks for the question. Andre, I kind of wanted to pick up where you left off about your P&G's commitment to remaining fully invested even in this environment. I think the -- one of the \u2013 the biggest questions and points of pushback that I've received around P&G in recent months is just this idea that given all the headwinds that you've talked about and quantified today and given the accelerated push on productivity that you've emphasized coming into the year and again underscored today, that there isn't enough leftover to keep those investments going. Investments that have been, I think, pretty critical in investors' eyes to enabling the growth that we've experienced over recent years. So maybe you could just step back and reassure investors and give some perspective on how much room there is to invest even as you push for productivity and work to offset these headwinds and kind of counter the idea that you're going too far in curtailing investments that's necessary for future growth. Andre Schulten : Yes. Good morning, Steve. Let me maybe start with productivity to reassure you on the ability to deliver significant productivity and then I'll turn it into the discussion on investments. We have increased our productivity numbers for the year back to pre-COVID levels. So we have good visibility to a significant step up versus what we were able to do during COVID, where we had to limit our productivity efforts to some degree to benefit innovation and shipping cases. With line time being available, we have now full ability to qualify those cost savings on the line. We have built digital capabilities to increase the speed of reformulation to drive superiority at lower cost. We have increased our ability to qualify new supply chains, if necessary, in order to reduce cost. We're improving the capability of our working teams and the plans to drive more efficient operations there. And we are constantly looking at our end-to-end supply chain, including logistics to drive costs out. And we feel very good about our continued efforts to drive cost of goods productivity. We'll talk more about that as we discuss Supply Chain 3.0. But the runway is there. The capabilities are there and we're seeing the visibility on the fiscal year results. On the media side, we also feel very good about our ability to drive continued investment in reach and quality of reach and better targeting while being able to flow productivity dollars to the bottom line to help offset some of the headwinds that we're seeing. We now have more than 50% of our media spend in digital. We are increasing our first-party data and our digital capabilities to increase precision of reach, not only in the US or in Europe, but around the world. And that is allowing us to drive significant productivity while increasing reach, while increasing quality of reach, and while more precisely targeting our consumers. Over the past three years, we have significantly increased spend in media by more than $1.2 billion. That's on top of the productivity we have generated over those years and on top of sales leverage. So we're also starting, I would argue from a very rich support plan for our brands. In terms of reinvestment of those savings and reinvestment of those savings reinvestment of those savings reinvestment capability within the P&L construct, we are not deprioritizing innovation. We will not deprioritize innovation. Every innovation that we've delivered in the market has created value and has continued to create value and contribute to our results. And in the overall results, we see that our approach of driving superiority is actually the strongest driver of our ability to limit volume impact, all pricing moves enable us to continue to price and deliver value to the consumer. So in aggregate, I think the team has full confidence that we can balance what we see, but it will require careful balance and doubling down on productivity to sustain innovation and investment in our group. Jon Moeller : Hey, Steve, this is Jon. I agree with everything that Andre said, just one additional short comment. If we find ourselves, which we don't currently, in a position where we have to choose between investing in the business and delivering a bottom line target, we will invest in the business. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks. Good morning everyone. I thought it might be timely to get sort of an update on what you're seeing in terms of consumer behavior in the US. You did comment on all outlet market share being flat in the US. As you know, it's hard for us to see that via Nielsen, but also just the absolute sales growth that we see in tracked and untracked data does look like there's category contraction that's going on. So I guess, commentary on what you're seeing, maybe we could just hit on, say, laundry and whatever pick another category will to talk a bit about consumer trade down and dynamics that you're seeing in the market would be great? Thanks. Jon Moeller : Good morning, Lauren. Yes, as you stated in your question, we seeing global value share and value share in the US holding, which is a great signal to our strategies working of providing value to consumers via innovation, as we price contribution of 9% on the quarter, with volume being down 3%, but the majority of that volume, so more than two points actually driven by Russia. Also is a good indication that the strategy of irresistible superiority works even in an inflationary environment where we need to take pricing. The US specifically, as you mentioned, our all outlet share is flat. We've seen strong growth in the US of 5%. There is some volume reduction, as you would expect, with the price increase and inflationary pressures, we see volume contracting by about a point or two and that is consumer behavior around entry inventory reduction, stretching purchasing cycles, and maybe being a bit more careful in terms of dosing. But overall, we're still able to grow sales within the market and hold share within the market at this point. To specifically talk to some of the categories you mentioned and maybe consumer behavior there. We talked about our fabric care situation in the last earnings call, where we were supply constrained on some of the portfolio in quarter three and quarter four of last fiscal year. We had reduced media spending and have reduced merchandising support stretching into quarter one of this fiscal year. And that certainly has resulted in some share pressure, which you would have seen in the xAOC shares. We feel very good about the team being able to reinstate supply to full efficiency. They have also reinstated media. They have reinstated merger support and strengthened merger support, and we're seeing our Fabric Care business coming back. Our volume share in the most recent read is actually up. We see continued strong growth on single unit dose, where the majority of the market growth is, and we're driving that market growth. In terms of consumer sentiment, in general, we see part of the consumer base in Fabric Care, for example, trending up, as I mentioned, into single unit dose. We see some growth also in our mid-tier brands as consumers are looking for value within our portfolio. They're trading into game, or into simply tied, for example, where we see some level of share growth. And that's the intent of our vertical portfolio, and our strategy to provide different value tiers to consumers. We are also seeing consumers moving two different price points. So a group of consumers is looking for value by trading into higher transaction sizes, to find lower cost per use by lower cost per unit, and we see other consumers who are more cash conscious, and they are very focused on cash outlay. So again, the other part of the strategy to provide pack sizes that stretch from below $10 for some channels and consumers to above $30 or $40 for others seems to be meeting consumers needs. So broadly, we feel good about the position we're in. There are some dynamics in terms of supply and base period that will be with us for a period of time. We remain supply constrained on a few categories, where we will see share pressure. Tampons, for example, the premium tier of our Fem Care pets business and on some health \u2013 some side of the health care business. But overall, we don't see any negative reaction, and we feel reconfirmed in our strategy by what we see in consumers' behavior. Operator : And next, we'll hear from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : Hey, guys. So a strong organic sales growth result in the quarter at 7%, especially given the COVID drag in China and Russia impact, but you kept the full year sales guidance. Is that just conservatism given its early in the year and some of the external challenges? Are you feeling any more confident around that full year range? And perhaps within that answer, given the pricing has been so strong, you can just touch on the volume demand elasticity you're seeing with that higher pricing, any changes at all towards quarter end or in October and how you're thinking about that front specifically? Thanks. Andre Schulten : Good morning Dara. The guidance of 3% to 5% is really grounded in what we believe the market will be. We see some softening in the market as we have communicated, about 3% to 4% value growth is what we're expecting the market to be. We want to grow slightly ahead of that. As you say, the first quarter gives us a good level of confidence that we're within the right range, but we're also very early in the year. So, we believe -- confirming the range is prudent. In terms of volume elasticity in my earlier remarks, as I said, we feel very encouraged by the fact that we were able to realize 9% of pricing in organic sales growth and effectively only see about a point of reduction in volume, which speaks to favorable elasticities speaks to our strategy working and providing consumers value with innovation even as we take pricing. As we always do, we assume that these elasticities return to historical levels over time. But certainly, the first quarter is a good indication. It gives us confidence that the approach we've taken around the world in terms of combining pricing with innovation and productivity in order to offset the cost is the right approach. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Bryan Spillane : Thank you, operator. Good morning everyone. I guess two questions for me just related to kind of how we should be thinking about phasing in the back part of the year. One is just in terms of price increases from here going forward, are you -- are there more incremental price increases that will flow through the balance of the year, or has most of the pricing that you need in terms of what's in your plans been implemented? And I guess what I'm really driving at is are we going to start to see -- would we expect to see more of a shift to volume contributing more to the organic sales growth as we move through the back half of the year and less of incremental pricing? Andre Schulten : Good morning Bryan. I can't speculate or give you an answer on future pricing. We adjust in the execution of the second pricing round for many of our brands. We took pricing on all our categories in the last fiscal year, covering about 80% of sales. We're now in the second round covering about 85% of sales and that's what we see flowing through in the first quarter. Many of these price increases in the second round are being executed in September and October. For the future, we will continue to observe where our cost headwinds go where foreign exchange rate goes. It's a very dynamic environment. We will continue to carefully balance innovation, pricing, and productivity. Bryan Spillane : Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse. Kaumil Gajrawala : Hey everybody. Good morning. Can you talk a bit more, maybe just give us some more details on what's driving some of these cost increases, especially as we're starting to see a lot of commodity costs start to roll over, doesn't feel like you're discussing it kind of impacting your P&L yet. So can you just give us some more details there? Andre Schulten : Yeah. Good morning, Kaumil. Look, the commodity cost increases are broad-based and different by commodity class. So, for example, we continue to see pulp increase. There is some relief on propylene and ethylene. But, in aggregate, we are not seeing broad enough relief on the input side to offset some of the inflation that is also coming from our suppliers. We call -- we don't buy propylene. We don't buy ethylene. We buy packaging materials. We buy super absorbers and materials that are secondary to that direct commodity impact. And that inflation is included in our $2.4 billion commodity headwind. So relatively stable on the commodity side. On the freight side, transportation and warehousing, as mentioned in the opening comments, we see some easing and we expect about $100 million less in headwinds, so $200 million after tax, down from $300 million. You see that market getting more back to [Audio Gap] contract prices as well. So that's been reflected. And then foreign exchange rate, obviously, is broadly across all currencies as the US dollar strengthens really around every currency in the world. And that's where we have bigger increase versus our initial guidance range about $400 million due to the ForEx effects that we've described. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein with Evercore. Rob Ottenstein : Hey, thank you very much. First, a quick follow-up and then my main question. Just so I'm clear, in terms of post-COVID consumer behavior, I mean, obviously, we've got some tightening that's going on and consumers searching for value you mentioned. But do you see any changes in consumer behavior in terms of those categories that increased demand due to COVID in terms of Home and Personal Care? Are we going to be at an elevated level there, or is it kind of just go back to normal? And then my main question is, can you give us a sense of how your business is progressing in China kind of sequentially through the quarter into October and what your plans are for 11/11. Thank you. Andre Schulten : Good morning, Rob. Yes, post-COVID behavior, what I would point to, obviously, is we see market contraction versus the pandemic phase in terms of antibacterial surface cleaning products, which is a small part of our total portfolio. Other than that, I wouldn't point to any major deviation from what we expected. Consumers still spend more time at home. I think, generally, the focus on our categories, which are cleaning, hygiene, health based continues to be high, which is, I think, playing back in our investments in Superiority being meaningful to consumers in order to provide value in an inflationary environment. The other element that is positive is some of the volatility might be disappearing. So when you think about categories like bath tissue or paper towels, where we had very volatile base periods with suppliers being in and out of supply over quarter three -- quarter one and quarter two of last fiscal year, that is stabilizing. So, those are the post-COVID dynamics. That obviously doesn't play for China to transition to your second part of the question. We continue to see the lockdowns in China specifically with Hainan being locked down for the last two months to impact consumption significantly. Volumes in China are down 5% to 6% on the quarter. We had certainly hoped for that to ease, but we still see significant negative impact on consumer mobility from the continued strength COVID policies. We don't -- going forward, we made no assumption on that changing. So, we have to observe where the market is going. We feel well-positioned. Once we see consumer mobility return, we feel very strongly about our ability to grow in the market. We have a strong team on the ground waiting to get going once the market fully reopens. And as we said before, we expect China to be a long-term growth driver returning to mid-single-digit growth here in the near future. Operator, do we have the next question? Operator : Next from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Nik Modi : Thanks. Good morning everyone. Andre, I was hoping you could provide some macro context in terms of what's being embedded in the guidance. I mean there's so much going on across the world. You address China to some degree. But perhaps you could just give us a little bit more context as it relates to Europe, especially as we head into the winter; US, maybe some of the developing markets? Just kind of how you're thinking about how the macro dynamics will play out over the next -- rest of the fiscal year? Thank you. Andre Schulten : Yes. Morning Nik. As you know, we generally orient our outlook on what we know today in terms of foreign exchange rate dynamics, in terms of commodity costs, in terms of energy costs. So that's what is built into our reconfirmed guidance range. When you look at the consumer side and the market side, obviously, we see high pressure on the European consumer, with high inflation and certainly, as the energy costs will hit the consumer over the winter period, depending on how much support from the European governments provided and when we need to be extra careful in terms of ensuring that consumers have appropriate access to our portfolio, making sure that we give the right value to them via superiority, strong innovation, the right price letter the right value tier offerings. So we expect Europe to be tough from a consumer environment standpoint, but well positioned from our portfolio standpoint in order to be able to compete in that market. The same is true for the US. We continue to focus with our retail partners to have broad access across our portfolio for consumers, so they can make the right choices. As we said before, price ladder is increasingly important, cash outlay choices are increasingly important, and that's what we'll continue to focus on. Enterprise markets are holding up well. And that's a key growth driver also in the quarter. You've seen all enterprise markets grow mid-teens and even LA growing at 23%. So we'll continue to drive the same strategy in enterprise markets of providing superiority pricing and productivity. Operator : The next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Andre, just a follow-up on that last question. Maybe you could just put some parameters around that, specifically around category growth rates. I think coming into the year, the guidance was underpinned on a 3% to 4% category growth rate. I think investors were a little bit surprised by the degree of slowdown at that point, just given the strength of the business performance in recent years. First quarter, I think, was better than the market expected, certainly from a demand elasticity perspective. Maybe just comment now, again, building on Nik's question, is 3% to 4% still what's underpinning your outlook and maybe you can share for key regions, US enterprise markets, et cetera, what you observed for category growth rates in the first quarter as we think about the balance of the year. So, thanks for that. Andre Schulten : Yes. Kevin, we expect a slowdown from the growth rate we've seen over the past years, which was 5% to a more modest 3% to 4%. That is still the case. We continue to believe that the majority of that growth will be price driven with a negative volume component, as you would expect given the inflationary pressure. We don't have more detail by region at this point in time, and it's really not -- it's really not a constructive forecast exercise to try to bring this down into a lower level of detail. So 3% to 4%, still underlying our forecast. We want to grow slightly ahead of that, which is reflected in our guidance range. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Christopher Carey with Wells Fargo. Christopher Carey : Hi, good morning. So, just two connected questions on focus and enterprise markets. First, just on the US, you noted that growth was 5%, which is several points ahead of what we can see in the US standard [ph] data. Are there any timing differences with inventory or non-track performance that you would highlight there? And then just tacked on the enterprise market in general. Can you just expand a bit on the acceleration we've seen in these markets? What's driving that uptick in growth? And maybe importantly, how you see relevant performance versus local competitors in these markets, namely if that growth is being driven by pricing and certainly, some of the local competition has different inflation exposures versus that of P&G. So, thanks on the US and the overall enterprise markets. Andre Schulten : Yes. To start with the US, we see strong growth in non-covered markets. That's explaining the overall stronger growth. So, just looking at the covered market here is maybe not reflecting the full reality that we've seen in the first quarter. So, broader growth in the US higher than what we've seen in just the covered markets. On the enterprise market side, same dynamic as in the rest of the world, we continue to see strong contribution from pricing, obviously, and the combination of us taking pricing, but driving innovation and priority at the same time, allows us to drive strong organic sales growth. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Raymond James. Olivia Tong : Great. Thanks. Good morning. My question is twofold. First, just kind of if you could give a little bit more detail on what needs to happen to get China to sort of -- to get back to mid-single-digit growth beyond, obviously, COVID going away. But my broader question is around competition, your ability to sustain the spending behind the brands given still very tough input costs and obviously, the move in the US dollar. Just kind of curious if you've seen any difference from what competition is doing. Since at the very least international competition since they have the very least don't have the same FX dynamics that you have. Thanks. Andre Schulten : Yes. Morning Olivia. China, I think you've answered the question. So, I will leave it there. We will continue to invest. I think our teams are very well set up, but we need consumability to return in order for China to return to mid-single-digit growth. So, I'll leave it at that. In terms of competitive spending, I won't speculate. I think the fact is, obviously, local competitors, as you mentioned, and non-US dollar-denominated competitors, multinational competitors have -- I don't see the same headwinds in terms of foreign exchange. Our strategy continues to double down on our own priority, continue to double down on our own investment. And as Jon said, our commitment to continue to drive Irresistible Superiority is relentless. And that is going to be even more important in some of those market category combinations where we see local or non-US dollar-based competition play. Operator : We'll take our next question from Bill Chappell with Truist Securities. Bill Chappell : Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to follow up a little bit on Lauren's question a while back on trade down. And you said, certainly, you're seeing some trade down within your categories within your brands. And I guess -- two questions. One, are you surprised that there isn't more at this stage even within your brands with inflation and with potential recession. And then two, maybe could you talk about, is there any differences in terms of trade down on what you're seeing in the US versus, say, Europe, Latin America, or is it all fairly, fairly similar? Thanks. Andre Schulten : Yes. Hi, Bill. Look, maybe the macro indication of trade down is two-fold. Our value shares in aggregate are holding, as we said, and private label shares, which is the other indicator for a trade down in the market, are growing modestly, both in the US and in Europe. When you look at the US, we see value share for private label increasing 30 basis points over the past three and six months. In Europe, we're looking at about 20 basis points of growth. Some of that is simply driven by supply dynamics. So where in the US, for example, where we see private label growth in our categories would be in bath tissue or in paper towels, where private label in the base period was not supplying well and we kind of picked up that supply over quarter one and quarter two of last fiscal year. Now, as private label is in supply and merchandising is reinstated, we see some growth. Encouragingly, when you then look at our Family Care business, sequential share is holding. So there is no direct link of private label growth and us not being able to continue to hold our share position or even expand our share position. Overall, trade down within our portfolio is the design. That's why we have created different value tiers; that\u2019s why we have created different pack sizes. So some level of consumer shifting is expected. We are very encouraged by many of our consumers actually continuing to look for the upper end of our portfolio. And I mentioned the Fabric Care example. Our biggest growth in the Fabric Care share is in the single unit dose segment in the total market, and we're driving that growth. So we're encouraged there. So we see trends in both directions. Part of the consumers continue to look for the upper end of the portfolio. Some consumers who are more exposed from a cash outlay or value standpoint, find a solution within our more value-focused tiers. Jon Moeller : I think some of the -- I mean, the clearest explanation of all of this, if there is such a thing, in a very complex world is that, value is found at the intersection of price, product performance, as Andre has said, and usage experience. It's not just price. Price is an important component, but those other components are equally important. And as Andre has said several times during the call, we continue to invest heavily in performance and in the usage experience and are hopeful that we can maintain a value proposition for most consumers. Some will, out of necessity trade down. And as Andre said, we have offerings to meet them where they are as well. But I think, again, to cut through this, you have to think about the totality of the value proposition to make sense of what's happening. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark Astrachan : Thanks and good morning everyone. I guess I want to ask about market dynamics for lack of better terms. Maybe start with reconciling global share being in line in terms of what you said on the call with the 7% growth that you reported organically in your 3% to 4% expectations for category growth, right? Obviously, that implies a bit of a deceleration. And then specifically, what's happening in segments that you talked about where there's market contractions. I think you mentioned in the press release, Hair Care, Oral Care, Fabric Care, specifically anything sort of takeaways from there and your expectations and what's driving that going forward? Andre Schulten : Yes. Morning Mark. Look, the outlook for the year is still 3% to 4%. This won't be a straight line. The best visibility we have is on the total year at the global level, trying to break this down into quarters or try to break this down as geographies is not helpful in our mind. So, we go quarter-by-quarter. The market growth dynamic by category are not fundamentally different from what we're observing. As I said, the only driver that is visible from a COVID to post-COVID world is in the surface cleaning and hygiene space, where we see a slowdown in the category growth. But other than that, the core drivers that we had predicted to help us deliver market growth is a focus on health and hygiene, more time at home and more focus from consumers on our categories. Our main job here is to drive category growth, and that's what we're really focused on, drive new jobs to be done, drive household penetration where there is potential, drive usage of patients via regimen use, and that's what we're focused on in our innovation and in our communication and in the market execution. Jon Moeller : And as you think about market and market growth, at some point, the whole market has priced. At some point, that annualizes and it's less of a contributor to topline growth. Yes, volume will hopefully be a partial offset to that. But I think it's normal to expect kind of a reversion to the mean as we get through the pricing cycle. Operator : Thank you. Next, we'll hear from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : Good morning and Jon, on your last point, I think just a follow-up on your comments on revenue growth management. I just want to confirm on the timing of this entry-level products hitting the shelves. I know you've done some of it, and which categories you're finding the need to offer Vermont the volume share. I'm assuming Family Care, Baby Care and Laundry Care, I just wanted clarify. And my main question is on what you're embedding in terms of additional pricing in Europe into the second half of fiscal 2023, which I believe is usually when the retailers accept new pricing negotiations. So, what is embedded in your guidance for the back end of the year or the fiscal year at this point. Thank you. Andre Schulten : Yes. Hey, Andrea, let me take this. The value tier and price point portfolio that we were describing has been implemented over the past years. So this is not something that we're doing ad hoc in reaction to market dynamics we are observing. This is something that has been part of the strategy for many years. So the introduction of Simply Tide or Tide Simply, the introduction of strengthening of labs, for example. So that has been there for a number of years. Also the strategy of having different opening price points from under $10 to a higher transaction size as has been part of our portfolio for many years. What we're doing carefully as we said all along, is when we price, our price execution is really tailored by SKU by category, by brand, by market. So that's why we pay attention to ensure that as we price, we maintain the right structure on shelf, be that virtual or physical shelf. Again, I can't comment on additional pricing in the second half. As Jon indicated, you would from a market perspective, expect that some pricing annualizes here during the next two quarters, but the situation is still volatile. So we will continue to look at what we're facing and employ a combination of innovation, pricing and productivity. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Hey, folks. Thanks for slotting me in. I guess, coming full circle to the top of the queue and on investment posture. I know that you raised media spend by $1.2 billion from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2022, as you mentioned earlier on the call. But you did start to get leverage on it last year, I think roughly 90 basis points of leverage, and you mentioned more leverage today. So question one is, how do we think about the right investment posture when it comes to advertising and media? And then secondly, Jon mentioned that we're going to see price subside as we anniversary, which obviously we will. In some instances, we'll probably see it subside to because of promotional intensity. And it looks like promotions are building in laundry sequentially, diapers sequentially. And as you mentioned, private labels reengaged in tissue, and that may require some promotional get back. So how do you balance being competitive in market, matching promotional intensity where needed, but yet still getting the price realization you need to cover cost. Thank you. Andre Schulten : Yes. On the media investment, I think we really need to shift focus. It is difficult to describe media sufficiency in dollars, especially when we are actively shifting our spending from linear non-targeted TV into programmatic and into digital spend, that is a lot more targeted and a lot more precise in terms of delivering reach and quality of reach where we need it. So spending reduction might not necessarily correlate with this investment. So we continue to, as Jon said, we committed to drive superiority of our brands. We will not step back from that, and that for us means higher reach, higher quality of reach, higher targeting capability, which we've built around the world, and that's the measure of success for us. If we deliver that, the dollars are an outcome, not the determining factor of efficiency of investment. On the price and promotion side, Jason, we've seen promotion levels come down during COVID, as you know, from above 30% pre-COVID to, I think, 16% was the low during the COVID period. We now see in our categories, promotion coming back up somewhere between 27% to 30%, which is to be expected. For us, the most important element is to use promotions in the right way. If we are able to drive regimen, for example, by co-promoting, co-merchandising, laundry detergent, and fabric enhancers where we have significant penetration opportunities in fabric enhancers, it grows the category, it drives incremental purchase, and it drives repeat of the trial if we do it right. Same is true in Baby Care. When we co-promote wipes with diapers, it drives higher usage in a relatively more underdeveloped category, which is wipes. So, in that sense, promotion can be a driver of growth, market growth, and profit growth, and that's how we want to use it. Jon Moeller : Just to build on a point that Andre made because the question keeps being raised, which is perfectly fine, but it means we're maybe not being as clear as we can. I'll just give you the example of North America to hopefully give you confidence in our investment posture. We had a discussion with the North American team a couple of weeks ago. Andre was there. I was there. Charles was there. And they had prepared perspective by category on dollar spend versus a year ago. And I walked into the room and said, this isn't helpful. What we need to understand is what are our reach objectives and are we sufficient and spending to achieve those reach objectives, what are our objectives in terms of number of weeks on air achieving that reach. And that's how we'll measure sufficiency. Now, I want to do that. We want to do that as cost effectively as possible. But that's the plan, and we went through an insured that category-by-category, we had sufficient reach and we had sufficient weeks of media and where we determine that we might not, then there was a discussion with the business leaders on what we could do to ensure that, that happened. So, we're spending a fair amount of time on this. We're very committed to it. And it's -- I'm sure it's frustrating because you don't have visibility to all of that. You just have visibility to the dollars, which I completely understand. As Andre also said, one other dynamic is we're moving a lot of the marketing activity set in-house. And so the cost for that in terms of, for example, purchasing media moves out of the advertising budget and into the overhead budget. So, that also affects the spend period-to-period. Hopefully, that helps. Operator : And your final question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge. Jonathan Feeney : Good morning. Thanks very much. Two easy ones, I think. First, I want to understand the bridge between the global pricing impact as cited at 470 basis points and global pricing of 9%. I'm sure it's easy I'm missing that. I just want to understand how that math works as we go forward. And secondly, you mentioned pantry inventories. I wonder, is there any data you have specifically about monitoring that in a granular way on a global basis or at least maybe some anecdotes about how that's worked in the past when we've seen periods of rising pricing and a little bit of elasticity. Thank you. Andre Schulten : On the pricing to gross margin reconciliation, I suggest you go back to our IR team for them to give you the math off-line. On the pantry inventory, we do have some data. We have in-home consumer data, specifically in the US and many other markets that allows us to see their relative pantry inventory. So, it's based on that observation in the market. But it's not illogical to assume that high inventories that were built during the COVID phase, for example, in bath tissue and paper towels slowly drawing down. I would tell you that we're still seeing somewhat higher levels than we've seen pre-COVID, but none of this is material. It's more an element of consumer behavior we're observing. So, it's nothing that would stand out in terms of the construct of the market growth or forecast. Jon Moeller : Hey just one thing as we wrap this up, and I'll turn it back to Andre. If you step back from all of this -- as I step back from all of this, I am just incredibly pleased with our team and what they've accomplished. 7% organic sales growth against the context of Russia, Ukraine, what's happened in China where the market is down mid-singles, that is truly a fantastic work; communicating the value of our offerings, improving the value of our offerings as we take necessary pricing, maintaining topline momentum of the business, great work. The other piece that I that I think portends a strong future is the work, as Andre mentioned at the onset of the call that's happening on productivity. Between commodities, FX, and warehousing and transportation, we had a 32-point negative AT impact on the quarter, and this team was able to offset 30 points of that 32 through the combination of pricing and productivity. So, that's the big picture, in my view, and I couldn't be happier. Andre Schulten : Yes. Only point to add is and the combination of value shareholding globally and in the US is a strong indication in our mind that the strategy of driving superiority even in inflationary environment is the right strategy for P&G. So, we'll continue to double down, as we said in our opening remarks. End of Q&A: Andre Schulten : With that, I just want to remind you quickly that we'll be hosting an Investor Day here in Cincinnati on the afternoon and evening of Thursday, November 17th. You should have received the registration e-mail in early September. If you didn't receive it and would like to attend, please get in touch with John and our IR team. Thank you for your time and have a great week. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

This discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections.  As required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business trends and has posted on its Investor Relations website, www.pginvestor.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures.  Now I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer, Andre Schulten. Andre Schulten : Good morning. Joining me on the call today are Jon Moeller, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Chevalier, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. We're going to keep our prepared remarks brief and then turn straight to your questions. Execution of our integrated strategies continued to yield good results in the October to December quarter, growing organic sales in nine of 10 categories, holding global aggregate market share, continued productivity savings, improving supply efficiency, sustained investment and superiority of our brands across all five vectors : product, package, communication, go-to-market and value, continue to pay benefits for our consumers and retail partners and in turn, for P&G shareholders. Progress against our plan fiscal year-to-date enables us to increase the guidance range for organic sales growth and maintain ranges for core EPS growth, free cash flow productivity and cash return to shareowners.  Moving to the second quarter numbers. Organic sales grew 5%, pricing at a 10 points to sales growth and mix was up 1 point. Volume declined 6 points driven by a combination of market contraction, trade inventory reductions and portfolio reduction in Russia. Growth was broad-based across business units with each of our 10 product categories growing or holding organic sales. Personal Health Care grew high teens, Feminine Care, Fabric Care and Home Care were up high single digits. Hair Care was up mid-single digits. Baby Care, Family Care, Oral Care and Skin and Personal Care were each up low single digits. Grooming was in line with prior year. Focus markets grew 3% for the quarter, with the U.S. up 6%. Greater China organic sales were down 7% versus prior year, as the market continued to be impacted by COVID lockdowns and weaker consumer confidence. We continue to expect a slow recovery as consumer mobility increases over the coming quarters. Long term, we expect China to return to strong underlying growth rates. Enterprise markets were up 14% with each of the three regions up 10% or more. Global aggregate market share was in line with prior year with 27 of our top 50 category country combinations holding or growing share. In the U.S., all outlet value share was in line with prior year with seven of 10 categories holding or growing share. U.S. volume share is up 0.5 point versus the prior year quarter, delivering sequential improvement from quarter one. Recent innovations like Downy Rinse and Refresh in fabric enhancers and Dawn Powerwash in hand dishwashing are extending superiority advantages and driving value and volume share growth. Innovation also serves as a catalyst for pricing across our other brands and forms in their category segments. On the bottom line, core earnings per share were $1.59, down 4% versus prior year. On a currency-neutral basis, core EPS increased 5%. Core operating margin decreased 170 basis points, primarily due to gross margin pressure from commodities and foreign exchange. Currency-neutral core operating margin decreased 70 basis points. Productivity improvements were 110 basis points help to the quarter. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 72%, primarily due to a temporary reduction in payables. We returned $4.2 billion of cash to shareowners, approximately $2.2 billion in dividends and $2 billion in share repurchase. In summary, considering the backdrop of a very challenging cost and operating environment, continued solid results across the top line, bottom line and cash for the first half of the fiscal year. Moving on to strategy. Our team continues to operate with excellence, executing the integrated strategies that have enabled strong results over the past four years, and that are the foundation for balanced growth and value creation. A portfolio of daily use products, many providing cleaning, health and hygiene benefits in categories where performance plays a significant role in brand choice. Ongoing commitment to and investment in irresistible superiority across the five vectors of product, package, brand communication, retail execution and value. As discussed during our Investor Day in November, we are renewing our superiority standards to reflect the dynamic nature of this strategy. Productivity improvement in all areas of our operations to fund investments in superiority offset cost and currency challenges, expand margins and deliver strong cash generation. An approach of constructive disruption, a willingness to change, adapt and create new trends and technologies that will shape our industry for the future, especially important in this volatile environment. Finally, an organization that is increasingly more empowered, agile and accountable with little overlap or redundancy, flowing to new demands, seamlessly reporting each other to deliver against our priorities around the world. Going forward, there are four areas we are driving to improve the execution of the integrated strategies, Supply Chain 3.0, digital acumen, environmental sustainability and employee value creation. These are not new or separate strategies. They are necessary elements in continuing to build superiority, reduce cost to enable investment and value creation and to further strengthen our organization. We expanded on each of these at our Investor Day in November. If you weren't able to attend or listen in remotely, I encourage you to review the materials on our IR events website. Our strategic choices on portfolio, superiority, productivity, constructive disruption and organization are interdependent strategies. They reinforce and build on each other. When executed well, they grow markets, which in turn grow share, sales and profit. We continue to believe that the best path forward to deliver sustainable top and bottom line growth is to double down on these integrated strategies starting with commitment to deliver irresistible superior propositions to consumers and retail partners. Now moving to guidance. We continue to expect more volatility in costs, currencies and consumer dynamics as we move through the second half of the fiscal year. However, we think the strategies we've chosen, the investments we've made and the focus on executional excellence have positioned us well to manage through this volatility over time. Raw and pack material costs inclusive of commodities and supplier inflation are still a significant headwind versus last fiscal year, though we have seen some modest sequential improvement. Based on current spot prices and latest contracts, we now estimate a $2.3 billion after-tax headwind in fiscal '23. Foreign exchange is also a significant year-on-year headwind. But like raw and pack materials, we've seen modest directional improvement. Based on current exchange rates, we now forecast a $1.2 billion after-tax impact for the fiscal year. Freight costs remain higher versus prior year, and we continue to expect the $200 million after-tax headwind in fiscal '23. Combined headwinds from these items are now estimated at approximately $3.7 billion after tax, $1.50 per share, a 26 percentage point headwind to EPS growth for the year. For perspective, recall that we began the year expecting approximately $1.33 of cost and FX headwinds. So despite some modest relief since last quarter, our current outlook is still $0.17 worse than our ingoing position. We are offsetting a portion of these cost headwinds with price increases and productivity savings. We are continuing to invest in irresistible superiority, and we are investing to improve our supply capacity, resilience and flexibility. As we've said before, we believe this is a bottom line rough patch to grow through with continued investment in the business and underlying strategies. As I noted at the outset, our solid first half results enable us to raise our organic sales outlook and confirm our guidance ranges on EPS and cash. We are increasing our guidance for organic sales growth from a range of 3% to 5% to a range of 4% to 5%. Within this company-wide range, we -- there are many puts and takes. As I mentioned, we expect to see some modest improvement in China, but European markets have softened as high inflation affects consumer spending. The U.S. remains relatively strong to date, and most enterprise markets remain resilient. On the bottom line, we're maintaining our outlook of core earnings per share growth in the range of in line to plus 4% versus prior year. The significant headwinds from input costs and foreign exchange keep our current expectations towards the lower end of this range. This guidance also reflects our intent to remain fully invested to drive our superiority strategy and increase investments as opportunities are available. We continue to forecast adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90%. We expect to pay around $9 billion of dividends and to repurchase $6 billion to $8 billion of common stock, combined a plan to return $15 billion to $17 billion of cash to shareowners this fiscal year. This outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Significant additional currency weakness, commodity cost increases, geopolitical disruptions, major production stoppages or store closures are not anticipated within these guidance ranges. To conclude, we continue to face high year-over-year commodity and transportation cost inflation in the upstream supply chain and in our own operations, headwinds from foreign exchange, geopolitical issues, COVID disruptions impacting consumer confidence and historically high inflation impacting consumer budgets. These macroeconomic and market level consumer challenges we're facing are not unique to P&G, and we won't be immune to the impact. We attempt to be realistic about these impacts in our guidance and transparent in our commentary. As we've said before, we believe this is a rough patch to grow through, not a reason to reduce investment in the long-term health of the business. We're doubling down on the strategy that has been working well and is delivering strong results. We continue to step forward towards our opportunities, and we remain fully invested in our business. We are committed to driving productivity, improvements to fund growth investments, mitigate input cost challenges and to deliver balanced top and bottom line growth.  With that, we're happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : So just a couple of questions on the full year guidance. Obviously, you didn't change the earnings guidance despite FX and commodities each being a little less negative than you originally thought. Is that more sort of making up for some of the sequential moves that we saw in Q1? Is it more you assuming reinvestment in the back half? Or is there something else in the back half? Just help us understand the reasoning there.  And basically, the same question on top line. I don't want to get into a 10-part question, but there's a bunch of sort of back and forth here. You raised the low end of the full year org sales range, but Q2 decelerated a bit versus Q1, the back half in theory implies a deceleration and volumes were a little weaker in the quarter. So maybe just taking a step back, how do you feel about the business in terms of looking at retail takeaway in fiscal Q2 and thoughts on the back half of the year? Andre Schulten : All right. I'll give it a try, Dara. So on the total year forecast, I think with half one results in, we are on track, very well on track to deliver the year and the guidance ranges that we're communicating. When you look at our EPS delivery for the balance of the year, we are assuming, as we always do, current spot rates on commodities and foreign exchange. And given our desire to reinvest, we would not assume that every dollar that we see in commodities and foreign exchange immediately flows through to the bottom line. We see significant upside for us to continue to invest in superiority across all five vectors. And if that upside is available to us, we will do that in the short term and the midterm. We have -- also, as we said in the prepared remarks, we are still above ingoing assumptions. So $0.17 worse than we had at the time when we provided the initial guidance. So that leads us to continue to be pointed towards the lower end of the core EPS range. But as you say, with more help coming, that probably is increasing our confidence to deliver that range or hopefully slightly better.  On the top line, again, when we look at the half one results, we feel very good about our standing here to deliver a higher -- the higher end of our initial top line guidance. So that's why we raised to 4% to 5% organic sales growth. And the fact that we see low volumes in the current quarter really is important to understand in more depth. So the 6% or 5.8% negative volume on the quarter, when you dissect it about half of that is not really consumption driven. So we have 1 point related to our portfolio choice in Russia, where we cut the portfolio by 50% to focus on essentials versus the full portfolio we were operating before. We have about 2 points related to temporary inventory reductions, which we saw in China with the market heavily impacted by COVID lockdowns and O&D. And especially on the offline side of the market, we see retailer inventories reduce reserve cash. We saw some inventory reduction in power Oral Care and Appliances in Europe. And we have seen in late December, very strong consumption in the U.S., where retail orders haven't quite kept up with that consumption. So if you strip that out, the actual consumption-related volume decline is about 3% on the quarter, which is in line with what we've seen in quarter one, which is in line with our expectation and elasticities that we would have expected, given the amount of pricing that is in the market. What is encouraging to us to raise the top line guidance is that our volume shares are holding globally, our value shares are holding globally. And when we look at the U.S., our biggest and most important markets, we actually see an acceleration of volume share by 50 basis points over the past three months and even 80 basis points over the past one month. Again, all of that gives us confidence to raise the top line guidance while we want to preserve the flexibility to continue to invest in superiority to drive more sustainable growth. And honestly, that's going to be our job here over the next few quarters, continue to drive household penetration to reinvigorate overall volume growth in the category. Jon Moeller : Dara, this is Jon. I would just add a couple of pieces of perspective at a macro level. The world seems to want everything to be better as do I. That's really not reality though. There's an incredible amount of uncertainty that remains. None of us, I think, globally really understand what the recovery rate in China is going to be as an example. And nobody really understands what the new policies and practices are going to mean in terms of consumer confidence in that context. You have the war in Eastern Europe. You have the highest inflation rates in 40 years. You have continued volatility in both the currency markets and the commodity markets. And importantly, that currency exposure for us is not a simple dollar exposure. There's a lot of cross rate exposures within that, which I realize makes it difficult to penetrate. But for example, the cross rate between the British pound and the euro has a significant impact on our bottom line.  So all that put together, while I'm extremely happy with the progress the organization is making I'm extremely confident that the strategy that we have is the right one that's going to continue to serve us well. It's just not an easy time to be taking up guidance to the top range of possibility. Operator : The next question comes from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : You covered a lot in that answer. So I'm going to switch gears a little bit and maybe talk about capacity investments. I think one of the big drag to gross margin this quarter was this capacity investments. I know there have been some particular areas like Fem Care, Oral is a big focus. So if you could talk a little bit maybe about anything -- Fem Care, beyond Fem Care where you're putting incremental capacity in to what degree you expect that to remain a drag to profitability over the next couple of quarters? Or is it a multiple year dynamic? Because that would also speak to some pretty healthy expectations around longer-term volume trends. And I think that's particularly relevant also as we look a little bit beyond the next quarter or two. Andre Schulten : Yes, Lauren. We are -- the short-term effect that we are describing here is indeed Fem Care related. We see on the top end of the portfolio, very strong growth. We have seen very strong growth over the past two years. And we are just need to catch up in terms of overall capacity to demand ratio, both on the top end of our pads business, which is the Radiant or Infinity business. And as you well know, we're still not up to full demand levels on tampons, which we will install -- are in the process of installing new capacity in the back half. The investments across businesses to catch up to the very significant increase in terms of business size is underway. So we have capacity investments across most businesses. I wouldn't expect it to be a significant drag on the bottom line. In fact, the growth that we anticipate will more than outweigh the cost of investing in capacity, and that's the plan, obviously. So we have high confidence in our growth potential and that's really what's triggering these capacity investments. Just in the U.S., for example, the last quarter was the first quarter we've reached $40 billion in sales, up from $30 billion in sales just four years ago. So -- and again, our growth rate continues to look very positive. Volume shares are up and better than the market, our volumes are trending to positive numbers year-over-year. So we need to keep up with that. The net of it is all positive. Jon Moeller : Yes. Just one quick clarification there. The $40 billion that Andre is referring to is a annualized run rate number. So it was $10 billion in the quarter, which translates to $40 billion, [Indiscernible] 4, just so people don't get too carried away. Andre Schulten : Fair enough. Jon Moeller : Lauren, the point that you made and the point Andre made, there's a lot of upside here as we bring this capacity online. We indicated we're not meeting full demand in some of the protection segments. We have opportunity, as you said, across the board. So we're investing pretty significantly. I think as he said and you've said the bigger impact will be in our ability to accelerate the top line. It should not be a significant bottom line drag. Operator : The next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Bryan Spillane : I just -- I had one clarification and one question. The clarification, just I think in response to Dara's question, you cited 3-point hit the volume from basically Russia and shipping behind consumption. So if we add that back, organic sales would have been closer to an 8 versus a 5. I just want to make sure that, that was the way we should be thinking about it? Andre Schulten : That's correct. Bryan Spillane : Okay. And then as we look into the back half of the year, I guess, just if you could comment on two things. One is, has anything changed in terms of your view of the macro setup? So just as the operating environment the same, better or worse than what you were expecting? And then also, just would we expect maybe to rebuild some of the inventory, the under shipment that occurred in the second quarter or the first half, would we get any of that back in the second half? Andre Schulten : I would say the operating environment continues to be difficult, and we expect it to be difficult in the second half. While I think the U.S. is holding up very well. Enterprise markets are holding up very well. As John said earlier, recovery in China will be very hard to predict and probably not a straight line. We expect China to be difficult in the second half as it was in the first half. The European markets will continue to have to work through very high inflation numbers I think we've seen a little bit of help via a warmer winter season that has helped energy prices. But Europe is not through, I think, inflationary pressures and consumers are still to see many of the consequences in terms of the eating builds as we are entering February and March. That doesn't change anything we do. I think the best way for us to get through all of this is to continue to invest in the business and to continue to execute with excellence, which the organization is doing and which is driving these good results. Our ability to carefully balance pricing and productivity to offset the inflationary pressures is critical. Within pricing, careful execution and combining pricing with innovation and sufficient investment to drive superiority of our brands is critical. So that's why we want to preserve some level of flexibility to do those investments as we get through the second half. Jon Moeller : And just a little bit of color on the inventory piece, which has been accurately described a couple of times here. This is a fairly simple dynamic that's occurring. When there is supply volatility and uncertainty, it causes retailers to build higher inventory levels. When there's demand volatility, it does the same. So we've been through a period where inventories have been a little bit higher than normal in some of our retail channels. Supply assurance is increasing, demand volatility is decreasing. So those inventories are understandably being brought down. And so Bryan, I don't expect that there's a significant swing here quarter-to-quarter. I think this is the system normalizing itself. Andre Schulten : Yes. I think Jon is exactly right. Our on-shelf availability is getting better. We're up now to 95% on-shelf availability, up from 93%. We make sequential progress. So as the supply chain is stabilizing, I wouldn't expect immediate return of those days on hand. I think some of it will come back, but it will take a longer period of time. Operator : The next question comes from Stephen Powers of Deutsche Bank. Stephen Powers : I wanted to go back just to the topic of reinvestment for a minute. It was a big topic last quarter, and I think you convinced us then and through your commentary at Investor Day that you were actually pretty fully invested in your prior outlook enabled by productivity. So as you think about the reinvestment that you're implying incrementally in the new outlook. I'm just -- is that -- should we interpret that as elective and opportunistic for kind of greater medium-term returns? Or is it more necessary in the near term given more concerning consumer competitive realists? Just how you'd frame that reinvestment would be helpful. And then if you could also just -- you talked about strength in the enterprise markets, your resilience. Just if there are any pockets of particular strength you could call out, that would be great. And any areas where you're more watchful, that would also be helpful? Andre Schulten : I would characterize our current media spending and support spending for our brands as sufficient, which we are paying a lot of attention with each of the businesses. John pays a lot of attention with each of the businesses to ensure that is the case. And sufficiency is defined as sufficient reach, sufficient frequency. It's not defined as dollars spent. So again, I want to come back to the fact that, yes, we view the current business as fully funded, sufficiently funded in order to continue growing our brands, their top-of-mind awareness and their equity. When we reinvest because there is a positive return in the short term, and we can further strengthen our brands or specific innovation that is out there. In the most recent quarter, for example, we've increased quarter-over-quarter, our total ad spend by $140 million. And that is a function of innovation timing. It's also a function of merchandising support and core timing advertising with that retailer support. So we -- you see us adhere to that principle of fully supporting our brands if there are opportunities to create short-term ROI, will continue to double down. Jon Moeller : And one other opportunity that we've talked about a little bit this morning, as additional supply comes online, there are often opportunities to increase support for the business to take advantage of that additional capacity. So we'll be looking for those, as Andre said, positive ROI opportunities to drive the business.  You asked about enterprise markets. When you get down to a country level, of course, it's very variable. But 14% growth on the top line, all three regions growing at over 10%. So the strength is pretty broad there. Andre Schulten : Yes. And if you look at L.A., 21% growth, for example, so that will be the top end of the growth and fairly consistent here. So enterprise markets continue to deliver very strong results.  Last point maybe on the media investment. The synergies we're able to create are a real and not insignificant. So if you look at Baby Care, for example, that business has grown 10% last year. They have completely shifted the way they run their media. They've increased reach by 20%, increased top-of-mind awareness by 26%. All of that while they saved 15% of their media spend. So the equation here really allows for sufficiency at lower cost. Jon Moeller : And that, again, just for clarity, is a U.S. dynamic that Andre has just described, the 10% growth. And I'll leave it there. Operator : The next question comes from Olivia Tong of Raymond James. Olivia Tong : Great. If memory serves me right, much of the pricing actions from last year will start to lap in the March quarter. So in your view, is the December quarter the one that has the biggest spread between price and volume? And could you talk about where your elasticity stand relative to historical view? And if -- and how price and volume tracked at the end of the quarter versus the minus 6 versus plus 10 average for the quarter. Andre Schulten : Hey, Olivia. The -- let me start with elasticities. The overall view has not changed. We continue to see more favorable elasticities than we would have expected on historical data pretty much everywhere, but Europe focused markets. And you can see with 10% pricing flowing through. And when you strip out the non-consumption-related volume effect, a 3% reduction in volume, that is a very benign elasticity that we're seeing in aggregate and allows us to hold volume share and value share as the pricing flows through. So we feel good about, again, the strategy, doing what we wanted to do and the execution being very diligent in each of the markets. Europe is the one place where elasticities have returned to what we would have expected more on historical data, and that is driven by the increased pressure on the consumer. We're also seeing a little bit of price lag here. So private label, for example, is pricing slower in Europe, and that increases temporarily the price gap versus private label. Nothing we didn't plan on, but that explains part of the higher elasticities. In terms of peak pricing, you're right, many of the large price increases get left this fiscal year. But that doesn't mean that we're not putting more pricing in the market. So for example, we have a number of price increases that go into effect in February. So there's two components here. One where lapping price increases were executed last year, but we're also still passing through some of the cost pressures via incremental pricing around the world. Operator : The next question comes from Chris Carey of Wells Fargo Securities. Chris Carey : I just wanted to come back to Steve's question on investment priorities. If I take your fiscal year outlook, you're clearly implying better margins in the back half of the year. But if I just walk through a gross margin bridge of what perhaps makes sense, it does seem to imply you'll need to see leverage on the SG&A line in the back half of the year to drive margin expansion potentially notable SG&A leverage despite sales decelerating. So again, if you could just help me frame overall SG&A and whether you think you'll be ending the year with appropriate levels of spending? Or if you expect investments to maybe grow progressively over the next 12 to 18 months as, for example, your capacity continues to improve, as Jon just said. Andre Schulten : I wouldn't expect a structural shift in SG&A spend. I think what you're seeing in the run rate is about what we expect to need in order to be sufficiently funded and the gross margin -- and most of the margin expansion will come from gross margin expansion as we ramp up productivity, pricing continues to flow through and that builds gross margin period-over-period. So that will be the bigger contributor. And we're not counting on any major reductions in SG&A beyond what productivity allows us to deliver again, at current sufficiency levels, and we are very carefully looking at what can we reinvest actually and still deliver within the range that we want to deliver. Operator : The next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala of Credit Suisse. Kaumil Gajrawala : Good morning. Your commentary, I guess, just now on taking further pricing, it's obviously appropriate given we have a series of costs that are still coming through. But can you maybe just talk a little bit about the response from retailers and is that changing in any way? Not that long ago, it seemed across all of CPG, it was maybe easier to get some pricing through. And I'm just curious if that's changing in any way. Andre Schulten : Yes, Kaumil. The environment continues to be constructive. We don't see much change in retailer conversations. It's focused on how do we best play the role that we need to play as a category leader in many of the markets by combining pricing with innovation, executing pricing in a way that consumers can appropriately choose from different price points, different value tiers. And how that plays out at retail shelf, both virtual and physical shelves in the best possible way, so we can help them grow their category grow foot traffic, et cetera. Those are really the majority of the conversations I would characterize this quarter or next quarter as any different than the previous quarters, where really it's about how do we do this, when is the best time to execute. It's not should we or must we take pricing. I think everybody still understands that we are recovering costs after we recover as much as we can with productivity. Jon Moeller : And as Andre said, the conversation, much more constructive for all concerned when we focus on improving consumer value holistically defined. And that's exactly what Andre was talking about in terms of the combination of innovation and pricing. And when that's the conversation, it takes on a very different nature than a more transactional discussion. Also don't forget, our retail partners are the owners of the private label brands that we compete against. They're facing many of the same dynamics in terms of their cost inputs that we are. So just to reconfirm what Andre said, it's been a generally constructive discussion. I don't see anything in my interactions with our retail partners that causes an inflection in that discussion in the near term. Operator : The next question comes from Robert Ottenstein of Evercore ISI. Robert Ottenstein : Just first a quick follow-up and then my main question. So one, in terms of follow-up, is the volume headwind in this quarter from Russia and sort of the one-offs? Is that just a quarter issue? Or is that going to linger on the following quarters? And then my primary focus is the market share data that you gave us in terms of the U.S., I think, was very impressive, particularly given some of the lingering supply issues that are going to be resolved soon. So can we expect perhaps accelerating improvement in market share as the year goes the supply comes on and maybe give us a little bit more sense of what the drivers were for the encouraging market share momentum in the U.S.? Andre Schulten : Yes. Robert, on the volume side, I think the Russia effect will be with us for one more quarter before we annualize. And on the inventory side, as we said before, we believe this was a onetime adjustment. I wouldn't expect this to come back immediately. I wouldn't expect a significant further reduction in inventory. When we look at the U.S., for example, where we have good data in terms of retailer days on hand, we believe we are at pre-COVID levels, which is about the level that we've proven to operate reliably with our retail partners. So I would expect that to be a one-timer with potentially some help coming in back over the next few quarters. The volume share dynamic in the U.S. is driven largely by Fabric Care coming back into supply. We have talked in the fourth quarter of last fiscal year and also in the first quarter of this fiscal year, that we had some supply constraints on our Fabric Care business that we had to address. We also reinstated merchandising support in the U.S. We've reinstated media support and that is playing out in volume share accelerating on the Fabric Care business. The other dynamic is family care sequentially improving from a volume share standpoint where we have seen a very high base when private label was in less supply and didn't have merchandising in the July to December period of last calendar year. That is being annualized.  So those two will continue, hopefully, to be a tailwind to our share position in the U.S. But as John said, it's hard to predict and look around the corner here, there are many, many variables that we don't control, but those two businesses explain the strength and hopefully, should have more upside going forward. Jon Moeller : And just one attempt at changing maybe a little bit some of the semantics from supply issue to supply opportunity. Our supply organization has done a terrific job. If you look at the last 15 quarters or so, our organic sales -- the amount of organic sales end of period to beginning of the period is up 80%, 90%, which is a really good thing. And they've done a tremendous job of trying to keep pace with that. And as we talked about, there's just additional upside to fully meet and satisfy that demand. Operator : The next question comes from Peter Grom of UBS. Peter Grom : Thanks, operator, and good morning, everyone. I hope you're doing well. So I wanted to ask about the change in the commodity outlook, which for the first time in quite some time, the outlook has actually moved lower sequentially, understanding that there's a lot of moving pieces, but can you just help us understand what's driving that? Is it broad-based? Or are there particular inputs where you're starting to see inflation moderate more substantially? Andre Schulten : Peter, it really varies period-over-period, month-over-month. We've seen pulp was holding relatively steady. It has come down a little bit now on different grades. Propylene, polyethylene has come down a little bit. But it's really broad based and it's changing month over month, week or week. In general, what we're seeing is -- as you would have known, the supply situation is easing a little bit, and that's obviously helping the market dynamic, both on commodities as well as on transportation and warehousing. There's no guarantee that, that will continue. We don't know what China reopening will do to the commodity market. That's a significant variable that nobody really understands at this point, I would argue. So we're watching this closely, and we continue to forecast based on what we know today, which is spot prices. I think the other dynamic we can't forget is that our suppliers are still working through their input cost inflation, their labor inflation, their energy cost inflation. So there are two opposing forces here. One is the desire of our suppliers as contracts roll over to pass that through to us. And the other one is input costs easing in the short term. So we have to take both into account when we think about our ability to pass through cost helps. Operator : The next question comes from Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : I have a clarification and a question. Andre, in your response about the destocking that should be over in the next quarter, is that also applicable for China? And how are you seeing China consumption rebounding as you exit the port and obviously, with the reopening? And if I can squeeze up your question, can you comment on how you're preparing your portfolio in Europe for potential recession? As you called out, things may -- and the bills -- energy bills may be kicking up now as we enter your third quarter fiscal. Andre Schulten : Hey, Andrea. Yes, the China destocking, I think, will largely depend on the China reopening and that's very hard to predict. I think if consumer mobility returns to normal levels quickly, that will be a tailwind for every retailer with real estate on the ground. And that's really the major issue that off-line retail is facing. So if traffic returns to normal levels, that will be a big help, and obviously, no further destocking required. I'll leave it at that because I have no good way of knowing not as anybody else. We expect consumption in China to reaccelerate to mid-single digits over what period is hard to predict. But in the midterm, that's where we see our China market and it continues to be an important investment market for us. We have a very capable organization on the ground, and they are spending their days and nights to get ready for that. Fine-tune our innovation, ensure we have the best possible marketing programs, both digitally and with our retail partners on the ground. I think on the European portfolio, we have prepared, like everywhere else, our portfolio for a recession. And it comes back to the basic strategies on the categories we play in. We are in nondiscretionary categories to a large degree that people won't deselect easily. They continue to wash their laundry, they continue to wash their hair. So that's number one for recession proving our business model. Step number two is investment in irresistible superiority. When consumers see the benefit our brands can deliver, the value will be clear to them and our ability to communicate that value clearly is critical, and that's why we continue to invest in both the performance as well as the communication. And then the last part is just accessibility of the portfolio, both in terms of brand tiering, so having premium brands but also value brands and price points across different channels, be that discounters or other retailers. So I think the portfolio proofing has been done, and I think it's showing results in a very difficult environment that we think speak to the strength of the strategy. Operator : The next question comes from Kevin Grundy of Jefferies. Kevin Grundy : We've covered a lot of ground. I want to try to connect the dots here on the 8% organic sales growth if we exclude the items that Andre called out, with comments in the press release around market contraction. So in the release, you mentioned market contractions in Hair Care, Grooming, Fabric Care, Baby Care, Family Care, across much of the portfolio. But as Andre talked about, the org sales in the quarter was closer to 8%. And if we look at the comp, it was actually an acceleration on a two-year stack basis. So what I really want to do is just -- I know we've covered a lot of ground on this call, just to make sure I'm kind of clear on how you're seeing category growth, how you're seeing elasticities and consumer behavior coming out of the quarter. Because it seems to me that the quarter is actually on a like-for-like basis, possibly even better than The Street had modeled. And setting aside China, you sound pretty constructive on demand dynamics. You sound pretty good on elasticity sort of relatively unchanged. And I just want to make sure that's the messaging for investors. Andre Schulten : Yes. And I would characterize, obviously, the Russia element will be with us, and that's real. I think the market growth has been around 5% to 6% with a negative volume component and a very positive price component. I would expect that in the midterm to moderate to 3% to 4% overall growth and still have a negative volume component with offset by strong pricing that we continue to flow through the market. If you look at overall market size over the past three months, that has been the case, and that's where we expect it to be going forward. And that's pretty much in line with how we model the balance of the balance of the fiscal year. Our job here is to be ahead of that. And that's why we're investing that we will continue to double down on the priority investments everywhere. Jon, I don't know if you have anything to add. Jon Moeller : Yes. It's a repeat, but it's worth repeating. It's a bit of a rain drop on the fray, Kevin. But I just want to highlight so that we don't get ahead of ourselves, how uncertain, for example, China is. Andre said it several times, we don't have visibility. We have, within our own operations, offices, innovation centers, plants, our current estimate of the infection rate is up to 80%. And we're sitting here in the week before Chinese New Year when all the traveling occurs. At the same time, we have a government and a populist who desperately wants things to get better. It's just very hard to say, hey, we should assume that as we go forward, China comes back like a tire. Certainly, we all hope that's true. I hope for China, that's true. But just you really need to understand how uncertain things are. Operator : The next question comes from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Mark Astrachan : I wanted to move from that rain drop question to a bit more funny question and just ask about whether the resilience of the U.S. consumer has surprised you all sort of what's embedded in guidance from here? I know what you said, Andre, about the category, but that was, I think, on a global basis. So how do you generally think about U.S. trends from here? And within the portfolio, have there been any surprises relative to historical expectations, meaning things that have performed better than you would have expected? And kind of what are you watching from here from a portfolio standpoint, all within the context of the U.S. business? Andre Schulten : Mark, I wouldn't expect the U.S. to fundamentally change. If you look back over the past six months, private label shares in the U.S. have been relatively steady. We've seen 20 basis points to 30 basis points of increase in private label share, which is a metric we're watching closely. But if you look at sequential share, absolute shares of private label, it continues to hover around 16%, past three, six and even 12 months. So there hasn't been a significant shift in consumer behavior in terms of trade down. I think the way that our pricing was executed with great support in innovation and great support in terms of marketing spend has helped. Our strategy isn't shifting. I don't see the market shifting significantly. All of that with a caveat that who knows what the next six months are going to bring. But if past behavior over the last six months, nine months is any indication, I think the consumer is relatively steady in the U.S., which gives us great confidence. It's our biggest market. We do well, expanding volume share, as I said, and hopefully have a bit more upside here as Family Care and Fabric Care continue to gain momentum. Jon Moeller : And this continues to be a market, the U.S. market that is very responsive in a positive way to innovation that improves performance, both for the product and the package. And we have many examples, Dawn Powerwash as an example, introduced at a premium price. The brand has grown at 50% since that introduction and Dawn has driven 90% of category growth in that situation. Down Powerwash, again, a premium priced item that was introduced largely during difficult economic times as a standalone brand would be the third largest brand of the category. So I just used that as an example for the continued positive responsiveness of U.S. consumers to innovation, and we've got a lot of innovation coming. Operator : The next question comes from Callum Elliott of Bernstein. Callum Elliott : Great. I wanted to come back, please, to the brand spend dynamic. And Andre, I think the example you gave to Baby Care is quite powerful. If you can increase so meaningfully while simultaneously cutting dollar spend. I guess that's probably driven by digital and better targeting there versus traditional media. My question is, do you think these benefits are sustainable or over the longer term, are we not likely to see some of these digital ROIs come back down as digital ad pricing goes up and some of your competitors start to catch up with your capabilities there? Andre Schulten : I believe that we believe that we're just at the beginning actually of our productivity curve. And it's driven by two things. I think Baby Care was one of the -- U.S. Baby Care was one of the more aggressive ones and one of the more obvious ones when you think about the consumer target, it's very narrow, right? You're looking for households with babies and diapering age. So going from mass TV where you have a lot of ways to hitting that target, which is about 3% to 4% of the population, provided the most obvious opportunity to drive synergies here. But we've learned also in other businesses, the opposite works. When you think about Fabric Care, everybody is doing laundry. So you've got a very wide target that you need to reach. And the Fabric Care team in the U.S. has brought their media planning and buying in-house, developing proprietary algorithms to better place ads during the TV programming, for example, and that in and of itself has allowed $65 million of savings in one year, while increasing frequency. So both models work and both models are still not everywhere. So we've got two examples in the U.S. There are many categories in the U.S. that are still building their own approach to drive these synergies and there's the whole world outside of the U.S., which is still building on the capabilities that we are developing. So we see this as a area of continued investment in terms of our own capabilities with a great ability to drive productivity for years to come. Operator : The next question comes from Chris Pitcher of Redburn. Chris Pitcher : Apologies for carrying on the inventories question. But Jon, you mentioned you were looking at a normalization. But in the Investor Day, you showed obviously a significant improvement in your supply chain efficiency. Do you think you're in the position over the next couple of years where U.S. retailers could operate at even lower inventories and improving your relationship with them is working capital part of the conversation that you have with them in sort of helping form share of shelf. And then thank you for the color on the international business. Could you share with how fast your Indian business grew in the period because it looks like the India consumer there is recovering and whether you're seeing a sustained double-digit recovery there as well? Jon Moeller : Thanks for the question. I do think that there's a significant opportunity for the entire supply system to operate at lower levels of inventory. And one of the enablers there in addition to supply dependability is increasingly looking at the supply chain across we historically looked at it as our supply chain and our customer supply chain as we're beginning to have conversations about this was one supply chain, would we do things differently? And the answer is almost yes. And the opportunities that are resident within that discussion are significant. So I do think we will continue to have that conversation and try to make progress in a way that benefits both ourselves and our retail partners and ultimately the consumer with higher on-shelf availability. And then go ahead, Andre, you want to talk about India? Andre Schulten : Yes, sure. The India business continues to accelerate. We saw Q1 growing 12% organic sales; Q2, 13%. And India is a good example of those capabilities that we were just talking about actually rolling out and being very effective. So the digital infrastructure we've been able -- the team has been able to create in India is quite impressive and that's contributing to our ability to drive disproportionate growth there, both from a sales capability standpoint and from a media capability standpoint. Operator : The next question comes from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Congrats on that sales milestone and the market share progression this quarter. I've got -- I'm going to cheat and like many, jam a few questions into one. So first, what geographies are you taking the majority of the incremental pricing in? Second, you're signaling more reinvestment on the com as supply improves, what shape do you expect it to take, i.e., product, advertising promo, et cetera? And lastly, I don't know if I should read much into this, but you've made substantially more references to volume share rather than value share this quarter. Does this reflect a shift in prioritization and focus for you? Andre Schulten : Thanks, Jason. On the geographies, I would not see any disproportionate tilt towards one or the other. If you look at the cost structure, the implications, they are pretty similar across the different regions. Timing might shift. Category is, obviously, shifting. Jon Moeller : Yes. There's one exception to that, I agree totally as it relates to pricing related to commodities. But there are some markets, of course, where currencies are devaluating massively. Andre Schulten : Right. Jon Moeller : And there is where you see our highest amount of pricing, take Argentina, Turkey, the usual suspects. Andre Schulten : Correct. So if you look at the enterprise market, that\u2019s where we generally take higher pricing in line with overall inflation in the market. So to Jon's point, that will be -- that will continue to be the case. There are other markets where pricing is notoriously more difficult to think about Japan, think about the G7 in general. So that's where you see less pricing impact. But that's not different from what we would have seen over the past few quarters. Look, our desire to reinvest is across all vectors of superiority. So it is product package innovation. It's in communication, it's in go-to-market execution. So all of those are relevant. They differ by region, by category, obviously. The reason why we're focusing more on volume share is we believe that it is our job and opportunity to continue to drive penetration of our brands. We have a huge runway when you think about our ability to continue to drive consumption and even the most developed categories. So we want to focus our team on driving -- continue to drive household penetration, continue to create jobs to be done, continue to drive consumption opportunities. A world in which all of the market growth is driven by pricing is obviously not sustainable. And so both elements need to come back in balance, and that's why you see us talk both elements here between value and volume share. Jon Moeller : Just for clarity on this point, though, I am not interested in volume share at the expense of value share. Volume share is a way to deliver value share. So at least we not be clear, it's both that are important, not a shift in emphasis between one or the other. The other reason that I wanted to make sure that we talked a little bit about volume is that it's a natural concern when we're taking this pricing as to how your volume is holding up and how -- particularly how is your volume share holding up. So we just wanted to be transparent on how we're seeing it, which is very attractive so far. Operator : The final question comes from Jonathan Feeney from Consumer Edge. Jonathan Feeney : I want to ask a simple question that's really complicated. When you look -- when you talk -- at the time you gave us the initial commodity guidance for the fiscal year '23, rough numbers U.S.-based spot costs for freight and energy composite for your company, you're down something like 9% since then. And you have lowered your expectation for commodity inflation. Simple question is, can you -- are your experience costs for this quarter below their peak? Like I see the year-over-year was 380 basis points of cost push headwind to gross margin versus 510 last quarter. So there's a -- can you confirm there's been a sequential step down? And secondly, could you -- in what quarter would we expect costs to no longer be a headwind like be all in the base? Would that be the June quarter, the September quarter? Or is that just impossible to say? I know there's a lot to unpack with cross-currency exposure and things that I don't see in U.S.-based spot. But it does seem like your costs are down from their peak. Andre Schulten : Well, on the second question, I don't know. It's just a very simple answer. On the first question, yes, we see sequential progress on the cost side. But as I mentioned earlier, it's important to understand the two opposing forces. We don't buy commodities. We buy pack material. We buy super absorbers. We buy films, et cetera. And our suppliers are still in the process of passing through their own inflation. So while their input costs via commodity helps is certainly easing, they also haven't fully caught up to their cost structure hits that they have experienced over the past few quarters. So we'll continue to work with them to find the right solution here. But when exactly that balance is going to occur, hard to predict. Jon Moeller : Yes. And just one additional piece of detail on that. It's not that they're slow. It's that we have contracts that cover, as Andre said earlier, cover a period of time. And in many cases, prices are fixed for a period of time. And then it's time to enter into a new contract. And that's what's going to continue to happen for the foreseeable future, not forever. But that's why it's difficult to look at, and I know you acknowledge this, look at U.S. spot prices as the holistic indicator of the direction of things such as not -- that's not sufficient. Jon Moeller : Okay. I want to thank you for joining us today, and thank you for your patience and unpacking all of this. John is going to be -- John, Andre and the team will be available the rest of the day to continue helping with that. My own unpack, I am very, very proud and thankful for the efforts of our team to grow 5% organically to do it across all categories to continue to hold share in the U.S. build volume share, to be able to increase our sales guidance all against the backdrop of significant deceleration of the market in China, the situation in Eastern Europe, the highest inflation rates in 40 years. This team has done an incredible job of executing our integrated strategy to continue momentum through all of that; and similarly, on the bottom line. We talked about the impact on the quarter of commodities, foreign exchange and transportation. If you look at the last fiscal year, plus our forecast for the current year, you're talking about 50% of profit being eliminated as a result of headwinds in those three areas. We grew earnings per share last year. The team did. We're forecasting to grow earnings per share modestly this year. It speaks to two things, I think, that are very, very important. One is the quality of the team; and two, is the relevance, the continued relevance of the strategy.  So for what it's worth, that's my unpack. And if you want to call on and discuss that further, I'm happy to do so. Thanks for your time. Operator : That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to Procter & Gamble's Quarter-End Conference Call. Today's event is being recorded for replay. This discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections. As required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business trends, and has posted on its investor relations website, www.pginvestor.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Now, I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer, Andre Schulten. Andre Schulten : Good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Jon Mueller, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Chevalier, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Execution of our integrated strategies drove strong results in the January to March quarter. Organic sales grew across all 10 categories in -- and in six out of seven regions. Global aggregate market share is holding steady, productivity savings are accelerating and enabling sustained investment in the superiority of our brands. In-market execution across all five vectors of superiority is strong and consistent : product, package, communication, go-to-market and value. Superior offerings continue to pay benefits for our consumers and retail partners and in turn for P&G shareholders. Progress against our plan enables us to increase guidance for organic sales growth and cash return to shareowners, and to maintain guidance for core EPS growth and free cash flow productivity. Moving to third quarter numbers. Organic sales grew more than 7%. Pricing added 10 points to sales growth and mix was a modest positive contributor for the quarter. Volume declined 3 points, including a 1 point headwind from portfolio reduction in Russia. Growth was broad based across business units with each of our 10 product categories growing organic sales. Feminine Care was up low teens, Personal Health Care, Home Care and Hair Care each grew double digits, Grooming, Oral Care and Fabric Care grew high single digits, Baby Care was up mid singles, and Family Care and Skin and Personal Care grew low singles. Growth was also broad based across geographies with six of seven regions growing organic sales. Focus markets grew 5% for the quarter. Organic sales in the U.S. were up 6%, including modest unit volume growth. Europe focus markets were up 8%. Greater China organic sales were up 2% versus prior year, as the market begins to recover from COVID lockdowns and as consumer confidence improves. We continue to expect further recovery as consumer mobility increases over the coming quarters. Longer-term, we expect China to return to mid singles underlying market growth rates for our portfolio of categories. Enterprise markets were up 15% with Latin America up nearly 30% and Europe enterprise markets up low teens. This is the fourth consecutive quarter in which all five sectors grew organic sales double digits in enterprise markets. Global aggregate value share was in line with prior year, with 30 of our top 50 category country combinations holding or growing share. Excluding Russia, global value share was up 20 basis points. In the U.S., all outlet value share was up 40 basis points versus prior year with eight of 10 categories holding or growing share in the quarter. U.S. volume share is up 90 basis points versus the prior year, driven by 2 points of absolute volume consumption growth in a market that is still down modestly versus prior year. Strong U.S. share growth in Personal Care has been led by innovation on the native brand and deodorants, as well as successful extension into body wash. Cascade Platinum Plus has driven strong share growth in auto dishwashing, and Dawn share continues to be up more than 1 point with ongoing leverage from the power wash and easy squeeze innovations. Vicks continues to be a growth leader in Personal Health Care, and we've delivered strong share growth in the Metamucil and Pepto-Bismol brands. In Europe, the new four-chamber Ariel Platinum PODS are driving strong consumer demand in Fabric Care. Fairy Power Spray is growing the dish category and building market share in Home Care. The new GilletteLabs exfoliating razor, male and female intimate grooming innovations and cardboard packaging upgrades are driving strong growth in grooming. Moving to the bottom-line. Core earnings per share were $1.37, up 3% versus prior year. On a currency neutral basis, core EPS increased 13%, good progress as we faced $0.31 per share of cost and foreign exchange headwinds in the quarter. Core operating margin increased 40 basis points, as 150 basis points of gross margin expansion were partially offset by SG&A investments and inflation impacts. Currency-neutral core operating margin increased 160 basis points. Productivity improvements were a 290 basis point help to the quarter. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was at 92%. We returned $3.6 billion of cash to shareowners, approximately $2.2 billion in dividends and $1.4 billion in share repurchase. Last week, we announced a 3% increase in our dividend, again reinforcing our commitment to return cash to shareowners. This is the 67th consecutive annual dividend increase and the 133rd consecutive year P&G has paid a dividend. In summary, against what is still a challenging cost and operating environment, continued good results across top-line, bottom-line and cash for the third quarter. Our team continues to operate with excellence, executing the integrated strategies that have enabled strong results over the past four years and that are the foundation for balanced growth and value creation. A portfolio of daily use products, many providing cleaning, health and hygiene benefits in categories where performance plays a significant role in brand choice. Ongoing commitment to and investment in irresistible superiority across the five vectors of product, package, brand communication, retail execution and value, we are again raising the bar on our superiority standards to reflect the dynamic nature of this strategy. Productivity improvements in all areas of operations to fund investments in superiority offset cost and currency challenges, extend margins and deliver strong cash generation, an approach of constructive disruption, a willingness to change, adapt and create new trends and technologies that will shape our industry for the future. Finally, an organization that is increasingly more empowered, agile and accountable with little overlap or redundancy flowing to new demands seamlessly supporting each other to deliver against our priorities around the world. There are four areas we are driving to improve the execution of the integrated strategies : Supply Chain 3.0, digital acumen, environmental sustainability and employee value equation. These are not new or separate strategies, they are necessary elements in continuing to build superiority, reduce costs to enable investment and value creation and to further strengthen our organization. Our strategic choices on portfolio, superiority, productivity, constructive disruption and organization are interdependent strategies. They reinforce and build on each other. When executed well, they grow markets, which in turn grow share, sales and profit. We continue to believe that the best path forward to deliver sustainable top- and bottom-line growth is to double down on these integrated strategies, starting with the commitment to deliver irresistibly superior propositions to consumers and retail partners. Now, moving to guidance. As we work towards the end of the fiscal year, we are cautiously optimistic. We remain confident in our strategies and the organization's ability to execute them with excellence. We continue to expect more volatility in the macro and consumer environment, and expect sustained pressure in costs and foreign exchange as we move forward. On the whole, our consumer markets remained relatively resilient, with U.S. and China volume trends improving, but with inflation pressures in Europe weighing more heavily on consumption. We continue to think the strategies we've chosen, the investments we've made and the focus on executional excellence have positioned us well to manage through this volatility over time. Raw and packaging material costs, inclusive of commodities and supply inflation, have largely stabilized over the last few months, but still remain a significant headwind versus last fiscal year. Based on current spot prices and latest contracts, we now estimate a $2.2 billion after-tax headwind in fiscal '23. Foreign exchange is also a significant year-on-year headwind and rates since last quarter have moved modestly against us. Based on current exchange rates, we now forecast a $1.3 billion after-tax impact to the fiscal year. Freight costs have moderated throughout the year, and we now expect them to be roughly in line with prior year. Combined headwinds from these items are now estimated at approximately $3.5 billion after-tax, or $1.40 per share, a 24 percentage point headwind to EPS growth for the year. In addition to these impacts, we are also facing higher inflation in wages and benefits and higher year-on-year net interest expense. We are offsetting a portion of these cost headwinds with price increases and productivity savings. We are continuing to invest in irresistible superiority and we are investing to improve our supply capacity, resilience and flexibility. As noted in the outset, our strong results over the first three quarters have enabled us to raise our organic sales outlook and confirm our guidance ranges on EPS and cash. We are increasing our guidance for organic sales growth from a range of 4% to 5% to approximately 6% for the fiscal year. This would put fiscal '23 in line with 6% top-line growth we've averaged over the last four years, which were 5%, 6%, 6% and 7% from fiscal '19 through '22, respectively. On the bottom-line, we're maintaining our outlook of core earnings per share growth in the range of in line to plus 4% versus prior year. Significant headwinds from input costs and foreign exchange keep our current expectations toward the lower end of this range. This guidance also reflects our intent to remain fully invested to drive our superiority strategy and increase investments as we value -- as value creating opportunities are available. We continue to forecast adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90%. We now expect to pay nearly $9 billion in dividends and to repurchase $7.4 billion to $8 billion in common stock, combined a plan to return $16 billion to $17 billion of cash to shareowners this fiscal year. This outlook is based on current market growth estimates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Significant additional currency weakness commodity cost increases, geopolitical disruption, major production stoppages or store closures are not anticipated within this guidance range. To conclude, we continue to face highly volatile consumer and macro dynamics. We also continue to see high year-over-year input costs, inflation in the upstream supply chain and in our own operations. Headwinds from foreign exchange, geopolitical issues, and historically high inflation impacting consumer budgets. As we said before, we believe this is a rough patch to grow through, not a reason to reduce investment in the long-term health of our business. We're doubling down on the strategy that has been working well and is delivering strong results. We continue to step forward. We remain fully invested in our business. We remain committed to driving productivity improvements to fund growth investments, mitigate input cost challenges and to deliver balanced top- and bottom-line growth. With that, we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Please go ahead. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to talk a bit about productivity, because over the last, I guess, two-and-a-half, three years during the pandemic and all the global supply chain challenges, productivity was something that understandably took a back seat. And then, this quarter really seen this significant change in what you've been able to realize. So, I was curious if there is -- if we should be thinking about productivity of something where there's, like, a catch up, where there's sort of projects that have been on the list, things you were able to get at, so that productivity could run at an elevated rate going forward? And it's also interesting I think in the context of marketing, how you've been so consistent in investing throughout? There's actually no catch-up on the marketing piece. No need to accelerate reinvestment per se, but maybe some, again, acceleration on the productivity side. So, I'd be curious to hear about that. Thanks. Andre Schulten : Great. Good morning, Lauren. I think, as you said, we are catching up right now to return to gross savings levels that are equal or close to equal to those that we've delivered pre-COVID. We have more line capacity available for us to qualify cost savings or mind space of our teams to be able to identify new opportunities. And as we are able to engage suppliers and get through this inflationary period, hopefully, more ideation and new projects to be created as well. As we've talked on our Investor Day, we see runway on productivity for the next few years, driven by Supply Chain 3.0. We have talked about delivering about $1.5 billion of savings with those initiatives between automation and digital capabilities. And we continue to believe that we can generate between $400 million to $500 million a year from media, programmatic savings both in terms of scheduling and buying capabilities around the world. Those programs will hold productivity, in my estimation, close to pre-COVID levels, which will allow us to continue to reinvest in media, which will allow us to fund innovation and superiority, and that is really the intent of the model. So, to answer your question directly, I would not expect a disproportionate catch up, but I would expect a steady return to pre-COVID levels of net structure savings, both the cost and media. Jon Moeller : I agree. Operator : The next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Bryan Spillane : Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. I actually had just one clarification and then a question. The clarification, the $125 million of, I guess, incremental interest expense, can you just give us a little bit more color on that? And again, is that something we need to kind of contemplate in our models as even we look past the fourth quarter? So, I guess, is net interest expense going up? Andre Schulten : Yeah, morning, Bryan. Yes, I mean, obviously, it is, right? Markets are getting more expensive in terms of credit and we are not immune to that. So, the $125 million [BT] (ph) we've quoted for this year, I would expect the trend to continue to go up into next year. Now we are still well positioned relative peer group because we're able to borrow not only in the U.S., but also in euro, in pounds and in yen. So that keeps us very competitive. But nevertheless, we're not immune to those increases, so they will continue to go up into next year. Jon Moeller : And just one piece of perspective there, Bryan. This is Jon. We've understandably, because it's been the primary driver of cost increases, focused our discussion on commodities. But that's not the only cost increase that we're seeing. We've just talked about interest expense. Andre mentioned in his prepared remarks, wages and benefits, which continue to increase. So, I would just encourage us all to gain confidence from what's happened here, but to realize that there are still, as Andre said, many headwinds that we're working against and we'll continue to work against as we move forward through next fiscal year. Operator : The next question comes from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Dara Mohsenian : Hey guys, can you hear me? Andre Schulten : Yes, we can. Dara Mohsenian : So, on the gross margin side, you were up significantly year-over-year in the quarter for the first time in a couple of years. Obviously, some nice sequential progress with the outsized cost savings and the strong pricing, but also your full year commodity assumptions and freight assumptions are a bit better than they were previously. So, just wanted to get a sense if we start to see this sustained improving gross margin environment, what's your perspective on the bias to sort of reinvest that upside back into marketing versus let it drop to the bottom-line? This quarter, obviously, with the magnitude of gross profit upside, you could do both. But just want to get a sense on how you think about that going forward? And if I can slip in a second part, are you comfortable you're getting a strong ROI on the higher ad spend? Presumably, obviously, you did this quarter, but how do you think about that going forward and sort of ROI on any spend that may be opportune or incremental to what you originally expected? Andre Schulten : Good morning, Dara. We would expect progress on the gross margin side. Actually we're encouraged by the productivity numbers that have helped us on top of pricing to deliver the first modest increase in gross margin after a very long period of heavy cost headwinds impacting us to the negative side. And as we've done this quarter, we will continue to look for value creating opportunities to reinvest. We firmly believe the reason why we are able to grow the top-line at the range we are growing, the reason why we are able to hold volume share and value share globally in a very tough environment is because of our superiority-driven innovation across product, package, communication and retail execution. And we believe that as pricing goes into the market and the consumer is even more, I think, sensitive towards the value equation that they are being offered, continued investment across all of those vectors is going to create value and serve us well going forward. So, we will maintain the flexibility to do so, but we will do it in a disciplined and in a very ROI-driven way as you say. As to your second part of the question, as ad spending becomes more efficient with our ability to in-house both scheduling and buying of media, more digital capability to be more targeted, that increases the ROI of every dollar we can spend. So, it actually makes investment in media spending more attractive. At the end of the day, we will maintain the concept of balance between top-line growth, bottom-line growth and cash generation to stick with our ongoing growth model and value creation model. Jon Moeller : Just building on Andre's points, which I fully agree with, I want to come back to this notion of balance and our commitment to it. Some of you have heard me talk about this probably many times, but it's worth repeating, so you understand how we're thinking about things. We have a chart that we use with the leadership team every time we gather, which shows what you would have to believe to deliver top total share shareholder return, which is our objective entirely through the top-line or entirely through the bottom-line. And to do it entirely through the top-line, you'd have to assume that we can grow 8% from an organic sales standpoint each and every quarter, which is in our view unrealistic. If you try to do it entirely through the bottom-line, you'd have to assume that you could expand margins 180 basis points per year. So five years, 10 margin points in a highly competitive industry where it's taken us 187 years to build 22 margin points, equally unlikely. So, we are very committed to driving both top-line and bottom-line. It's the only way we see to get home. I have a trite little saying that we use on occasion, which is \"Top-line with no bottom-line, a waste of time. Bottom-line with no top-line, just a matter of time.\" We're going to continue to operate in that vein. And if we're successful, you'll see top-line growth driven by proper levels of investment and bottom-line growth and margin expansion -- modest margin expansion. One last thing on the point of advertising rate of return, or ROI, in addition to what Andre was talking about, we simply have, though maybe hard to believe, a lot of low-hanging fruit that's out there. We have many categories where we are not at our target levels of reach. And that's a very high ROI activity when we can reduce wasted frequency, reinvest that into expanded reach, very good things happen. As you've seen, by the way, not just this quarter, but for the last four years. And there's no reason to change that approach at this point in time. Operator : The next question comes from Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Steve Powers : Hey, thanks, and good morning. So, overall volume this quarter came in roughly in line at least with our expectations, but both price and mix delivered upside, which I think implies just better structural elasticity than we were expecting. And I guess the question is, as you balance everything, just your relative confidence that, that can continue? On the one hand, you have some tailwinds for sure as China comes back and service levels seem to be improving, your reinvestment rate is admirable as we've been talking about. But there's obviously uncertainties out there. And so, I guess, maybe just a little bit of perspective on your overall confidence and where that confidence is more versus less elevated? Andre Schulten : Good morning, Steve. I'll try a careful balance here between giving you perspective on the global basis and not letting you get ahead of yourself in terms of expectations. But the volume decline is better than we would have expected, as you said. Our elasticities remain favorable on an aggregate basis. And if you look at global markets, we actually see a volume consumption stabilizing. So, you would have seen in previous quarters global volumes across our categories down roughly 3 points to 4 points. In our most recent read, which is the past one month, volumes were actually down 70 basis points. This is market volume. And if you exclude Russia, probably more around flat. That's with China returning to some level of growth, and it's also with pricing moving into the base. So, we'll see as pricing becomes more annualized, we'll see that stabilization. I don't know if it's going to continue to be neutral. I would expect some level of negativity in terms of overall market volumes, but certainly improving sequentially. Within that, I think we're taking comfort in the fact that we are able to hold global volume share and global value share despite significant pricing that we have taken, which has enabled, as we said, we believe by our superiority strategy, a strong vertical portfolio, both tiers and price points and being present in all channels where consumers want to shop. In our biggest most important market, as we had in our prepared remarks, we were able to grow volume and volume share, 90 basis points over the past three months. So that's the positive side. On the negative side, Europe continues to be a high-pressure environment. We've been able to grow sales 8% in focus markets, but that it was a very strong pricing contribution with negative volumes in the range of 7%. And the European consumer is trading into private label. We see the price differential between private label and branded competitors increasing as private label is delaying price increases. The consumer continues to be under pressure there. So that's going to be a continued headwind, I think, from the volume side. Overall, I think our outlook is balanced. As we said, we expect market growth to return to 3% to 4% on the value side and there has to be a positive volume component to that going forward, but it will take a few quarters before we get there. Operator : The next question comes from Kevin Grundy of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Kevin Grundy : Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and congratulations on another strong set of results. I thought maybe we could spend a moment on China and the reopening there. Of course, given the importance of that market for you guys, being the second largest market behind only the U.S., so up 2% sequential improvement, which is encouraging, we see that in the China retail sales, including cosmetic continues to show sequential progress. You've been consistent about your target of mid-single digit growth for that market longer term. However, it also seems plausible that you potentially exceed that level of growth at least in the intermediate term here given easier year-over-year comps and then maybe the potential for some inventory rebalancing at retail as consumer demand improves. Can you comment a bit more on what you're seeing in China? And then, perhaps offer some broader views on the pace of the recovery, and how you see that playing out? Thank you. Jon Moeller : Hey, Kevin. This is Jon. I'll hand it over to Andre to give some more numerical perspective. But I thought it might help just to share briefly the trip that myself and a large contention of our leadership team were able to make to China in the last three weeks. We spent more than a week there. It was wonderful to reconnect with our organizations, who are doing a tremendous job. We spent time in consumer homes. We spent time with our retail partner leaders in their stores and in their offices. And of course, we spent time with various government authorities. And without getting into all the details, the bottom-line conclusion was a very positive one, and much more than I was expecting even, and I'm kind of a China fan having worked there many years ago and having lived there. So, my expectation has already started high and those were exceeded. Having said that, and we talked about this on the last call, this is not going to be a vertical restart. And there will be a number of twists and turns, including some of the ones that you've mentioned along the way. As Andre said in his prepared remarks, we expect China to continue to contribute at a meaningful level over the middle- to long-term. But everything looks reasonably positive and constructive. Andre, do you have any other perspective on that? Andre Schulten : No, I think you said it. I think the other component we're not yet seeing is any return of Chinese consumers to travel retail. That is a significant negative for us in the SK-II business specifically. So that, hopefully, we see a more positive trend there in the near future. That's the only other upside that I think we have. But as Jon said, I think the recovery at 2% organic sales in the quarter is very consistent with what we would have expected. Operator : The next question comes from Robert Ottenstein of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Robert Ottenstein : Great. Thank you very much. Just a quick follow-up on -- or clarification on some of the numbers and then my real question. So, the clarification is I think you mentioned that mix was a positive impact on sales, but it was a slight negative drag on the gross margins. Just like to understand that. And then, my focus question really is, if you go into more detail on the U.S. business and the U.S. consumer, you mentioned that you saw an improving U.S. consumer. So, any kind of clarification around that? And then, an update on your pricing in the U.S., how much you saw in the quarter? How much more is there to go in the next quarter? And any kind of impact that you're seeing, any granularity on that would be appreciated. Thank you. Andre Schulten : Good morning, Robert. On the gross margin and sales connection here from mix perspective, the effect that you're seeing here is product mix. So, consumers when they come into our P&G portfolio, tend to trade up into higher-value items. We've seen that actually consistently over the past quarters. So that -- as they trade up into higher unit sales, that's a positive impact from a mix perspective on the top-line. But those higher unit sales items also have higher unit profit, but the gross margin in percentage is slightly lower for some of them. When you think about adult incontinence, for example, when you think about fabric care, single unit dose versus liquid detergent, gross margin percentage lower, unit sales higher, unit profit higher. So, it's a positive effect both from the top-line and the bottom-line standpoint, but the percentage mix is lower. U.S. consumer, I think is holding up well. As we said, any indication that we see on our business is that the consumer is still choosing P&G brands. We are growing volume share in a market that is still down on volume. We are growing absolute volume. So, 90 basis points value share goes, 40 basis points value share goes fairly consistently across periods. We also see private label shares stable at 16%, really no movement here over the past one, three, six, nine months, which is a good indication that we don't see any material trade down. Now we're watching this very closely. And we believe that a lot of that is again driven by our very intentional strategy to drive superiority. We continue to invest in innovation. We'll continue to invest in product packaging innovation. We're increasing, as Jon said, communication frequency and reach where we see a good payout and return. Continue to work with our retail partners to ensure that the presentation of our brands online and in-store is as good as it can be. Last element I would call out is we are stable in terms of supply and on-shelf availability, which is also helping our overall position in the market. So, stable, I think is the characterization, but we're watching carefully. Jon Moeller : And just one additional point, the 6% top-line organic sales growth that the team delivered in the quarter, and as Andre said, sales share -- value share growth and volume share growth, we still have a couple of categories where we are not supplying full demand. That'll be remediated here fairly quickly. But as you as you consider the strength of the U.S. consumer, if you look at those key measures, and realize that there -- while there are both opportunities and risks within the number, there are opportunities as well as risks, which continue to point to a relatively healthy U.S. consumption pattern. Operator : The next question comes from Peter Grom of UBS. Please go ahead. Peter Grom : Thanks, operator, and good morning, everyone. So, I wanted to ask about the changes in the commodity and freight outlook. Second straight quarter that these headwinds have moved lower, which is nice to see. Can you maybe just give a sense what you're seeing within that bucket? Where are costs moving lower? Where are costs still sticky? And while I don't expect you to comment on '24 at this point, but maybe just conceptually how you see inflation evolving as we look out over the next 12 to 18 months? Thanks. Andre Schulten : Good morning, Peter. Freight is relatively stable at this point in time, as we've mentioned in the prepared remarks. We expect our freight and transportation and warehousing costs to be roughly in line with prior year. And I think that is a reflection of a more balanced capacity situation with a driver to load ratio returning to, I think, more historical norms. Again, given fuel prices and all other dynamics, I wouldn't expect any major change going forward, but we're at least stable. From a commodity basket standpoint, we continue to see a mixed bag. We have some help in resin-based commodities. We have some help in pulp, though that is moderated by mill shutdowns for maintenance, both planned and unplanned. But on the other side, all our high--energy usage materials, when you think about caustic soda, when you think about ammonia, all of those are increased in pricing. So, the moderation is really limited and it's not consistent across the basket. So, $100 million after tax is the only thing we're seeing at this point in time. We also continue to see upstream in the supply chain. Our suppliers continue to try to recover their input cost increases, their labor inflation, and that continues to be a discussion that is ongoing. I think as we mentioned in CAGNY, some of those contracts roll over 12 months, 18 months. So, there's -- these headwinds and these discussions will continue to be with us. Overall, we're expecting, as we always do, spot rates will hold on, that's what's based and underlying our planning for next year and our guidance for this year. Operator : The next question comes from Andrea Teixeira of J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you. Good morning. So, how should we think about the upside in Beauty? And both you Jon and Andre spoke briefly about travel retail being an upside in Asia. How should we be thinking also on the other side, lapping the triple pandemic and the respiratory benefit you had in healthcare? It seems you could benefit from digestive recently, but how should we be thinking about the other segments? And as we -- just a clarification. As we put in the embedded organic in the fourth quarter is a 4%. But it seems as if you are -- as Andre commented, the exit rate on your volume is potentially flat, bear in mind, of course, the potential risking in Europe. But should we be thinking more of a better quality in terms of the delivery in organic, so even though it would be a 300 basis points deceleration on a sequential basis, you'd still have better volumes, maybe flattish to maybe only slightly down and a 4% price component in there? Thank you so much. Andre Schulten : Hey, Andrea. Andrea Teixeira : Hi, Andre. Andre Schulten : On the category specific questions, yes, we see SK-II as potential beneficiary of travel retail reopening. Overall, SK-II is recovering well outside of that channel. In China, Mainland, we saw 8% growth in the quarter. In Japan, we saw 46% growth in the quarter. But the overall results are still held back by travel retail. So, I think, we will see a sequential improvement, but there are many gives and takes in the overall Beauty Care sector. So that needs to be seen in context with a lot of other dynamics that are going on around the world. On the Personal Health Care side, we continue to be very pleased with the results the team is delivering there. And we see sustained growth in this space across respiratory, digestive, nerve care. There are many parts of that portfolio that have very high growth potential. And in some of these areas as we've talked before, we're still held back by supply constraints, which might provide upside in the future. But again, we have a combination of 10 categories across multiple markets. Some of them will do well in a period of time, some of them will be held back by negative headwinds. So, we continue to strive for a balanced top- and bottom-line growth picture. It will be driven by different parts of the portfolio over different times. From a volume versus price component standpoint, what is important to understand is quarter four, we will start to lap price increases for the first time. So, we had about 8% of pricing in the base. So that will be a negative headwind to the top-line growth in quarter four. And while we see stabilization of volumes, I would expect that there still will be negative volume component to the growth in the near future. We have still Russia portfolio being with us as a negative headwind. China is slowly recovering, but not yet in positive territory from a volume perspective. And as I mentioned earlier, the European consumer is under a lot of pressure with private label pricing not yet following the branded competition in those markets. So, pricing will come into the base. That will be a headwind to the top-line. I would expect there's still a negative volume component in quarter four. Jon Moeller : Yes. One thing to remember too is that we've just taken pricing in both the U.S. and Europe. And I don't think that the data for the current quarter reflects a potential volume impact from some of that pricing. So, I would be looking at volume recovery -- volume to slowly improve over time, but it won't happen overnight. Operator : The next question comes from Filippo Falorni of Citi. Please go ahead. Filippo Falorni : Hey, good morning everyone. Thanks for the question. Jon, clearly you've gone through a lot of transformation over the past five, six years that the company bought from a portfolio standpoint, organizational standpoint, superiority. Can you help us understand how you think internally these changes can help you navigate a potentially weaker consumer environment if what we're seeing in Europe were to extend into the U.S. and some other parts of the world? Thank you. Jon Moeller : Sure. And Andre may have some thoughts here as well. The -- what I really like about the strategic choices that we've made and the approach that we're taking currently is that it is the strongest approach I can think of. For a very healthy economic environment or a very difficult economic environment, the indicated actions don't change. So, think for example about our embedding in productivity as a fundamental part of our DNA. That's something that serves us very well. A positive economic environment as critical in a downward economic environment. The importance of superiority to consumers and categories where performance drives brand choice, critical in both a good economic environment and a difficult economic environment. Focus of the portfolio on daily use categories where performance drives brand choice and superiority within each of those categories across product, package, communication, go-to-market and value for consumers and customers, I just -- I don't see anything in that, that I would change if we have -- I mean obviously, tactically, there'd be some different decisions on the margin, but the broad underlying approach sets us up very well even if or particularly if we end up in a more difficult environment. Operator : The next question comes from Olivia Tong of Raymond James. Please go ahead. Olivia Tong : Great. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow-up on pricing, particularly on the new pricing, whether your view in terms of elasticities relative to previous rounds of pricing have -- whether they've changed or stay similar to what you've seen already. And to the extent that you can draw some conclusions on markets where pricing is now starting to lap versus markets where you're still rolling out price hikes, can you just compare and contrast what you're seeing, especially since you're starting to see some modest volume growth in the U.S.? Thanks. Andre Schulten : Good morning, Olivia. The most recent round of pricing have gone into effect just in February and March across -- and I'm calling out across Europe and U.S., because [those are somewhat] (ph) visible. So, it's hard for us, as Jon said, to determine what the outgoing elasticities are at this point in time. What I can tell you is that elasticities remain stable, remain favorable. And I think it is also a function of continued investment. It is a function of continued innovation. Every price increase or most price increases are connected to innovation, meaningful innovation for the consumer, that also guarantees retail support. They are linked to strong value communication. We've talked about Ariel Coldwater, Tide Coldwater, Charmin rollback, Olay value communication. And that is meaningful for consumers as they come under pressure. Many of our categories are categories where a consumer doesn't want a risk failure. You don't want to wash your clothes twice and you certainly don't want to deal with a diaper failure. So, all of that I think is helping us to maintain favorable elasticities across the board. The most important insight for us is -- and that's what you see us do in Q3, we need to continue that investment. We need to look for opportunities where our value is exposed, and I'll call out Europe as an example because of private label pricing at a lower pace than the branded competitive set. It is critically important that we maintain that investment level to maintain the value equation. Where we see pricing lapping or I think where we have the strongest portfolio and the strongest execution in terms of innovation and superiority, we see favorable results, and the U.S. is a good example of that. Excellent in market execution by the team compared with a truly strong portfolio and strong innovation is delivering both relatively strong results to the balance of market, but also driving market growth recovery. Operator : The next question comes from Chris Carey of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Chris Carey : Hi. Good morning. Can you just talk about your playbook in Europe? You've noted European private label is delaying price increases a number of times on this call. We've heard similar commentary from others in Staples. If price gaps in private label remain wide, do you simply accept that new level? Or you need -- do you need to do something about it to be a bit more offensive to close the gap? And I guess I say that in the context of Europe, of course, but also as a -- bit of a litmus test for price competition that could play out globally in month and quarters ahead, and just how you think about managing through that type of dynamic? Thanks so much. Andre Schulten : Yeah. I'll start, Chris, and then I'm sure Jon will add. I think, the team is accepting the reality of an extended or expanded price gap versus private label as the challenge they need to deal with. And as Jon frequently says, we wake up every Monday morning and deal with the reality in front of us. This is a reality we need to deal with. So, what that means is we need to create innovation. We need to create product and packaging innovation, communication strategies and in-market executions that are able to provide value to consumers and retailers. And that's what we're focused on. I don't think that trying to eliminate the price differential is a meaningful and helpful strategy for us. But if we can generate growth via innovation and via superiority, that's both helpful for us and the market and the path forward we're choosing. Jon Moeller : I couldn't agree more. And frankly, while Andre rightly points to a difficult consumer environment, if you look at our results thus far in Europe, they're very encouraging, not just in the last quarter, but through last fiscal year as well. We're achieving growth rates in Europe that are higher than we've seen in a long time. And so, now is not the time to back off. It's time to move forward and strengthen the execution, just as Andre described. That doesn't mean we have our heads in the sand. We've made several adjustments to price gaps, not just versus private label, but versus branded competition as we've gone through this period of pricing, and we need to continue to be sensitive to that. But first and foremost, we need to delight consumers and customers with the offerings that we're bringing to market and go from there. Operator : The next question comes from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jason English : Hey, good morning, folks. Thanks for just letting me in, and congrats on strong results. A couple of quick questions. So, first on pricing. Can you give us some more quantification on perhaps breadth than magnitude? And when you blend it all together, what sort of order of magnitude should we expect at consolidated level in terms of organic sales contribution going forward? And then, secondly, SG&A, love to see the reinvestment back in the business. But really sharp sequential change both in terms of year-on-year for overall SG&A and just sequential dollar step up. Can you unpack a bit more kind of where the money is? What's -- where the extra investment is going? Andre Schulten : Yes, good morning, Jason. Pricing magnitude, the latest round of pricing is fairly consistent with what you would have seen in the past, but it's very tailored to the market as we said before. Mid-single digits, I think, is the ballpark I would give you for the latest increase. And I think pricing over time will move back to be a contributor to top-line, but not the sole contributor to top-line. So, we need -- and the market needs to find a balance here over the next few quarters to return to modest volume growth and pricing contribution to return these categories to mid-single digit growth. That's what we're working towards. On the SG&A line, look, a lot of our reinvestment is driven by innovation timing, so when are the right initiatives in market to double down on. They are driven by pricing timing. So, when do we and can we support our brands as we take pricing and drive innovation. What I would tell you is the latest push we had as a management team to our earlier discussion was to really double click on our sufficiency in Europe and to see how high is up, what -- how hard can we push, especially the media and communication side in terms of value communication across Europe. So that's the one area I will give you where we paid a lot of attention over the last three, four months. Jon Moeller : I would just add one thing. It's our category leaders that determine the level of investment that we're making at any point in time. And prior to this quarter, just as you go back in time, there were more situations where we weren't able to fully supply demand. And, obviously, those are situations that you -- you continue to invest in mental awareness and --- but not spike that investment, because you can't supply it. And as we get into an increasingly better supply environment as we did in the last quarter, you resume a level of spending now that you can fully support it. So that's a part of the dynamic in addition to the dynamic that Andre described. Operator : The next question comes from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Please go ahead. Mark Astrachan : Yes, thanks, and good morning everyone. Wanted to ask sort of related two-part question more about U.S., but I suppose you could talk globally if relevant. How sticky do you think this strategy of irresistible superiority is in terms of volumes? Obviously, we see that you're gaining share if you look at the U.S. So, you're effectively trading consumers to higher-value products that work better than peer sets, right? So, it would suggest then there's a stickiness here that perhaps didn't exist in kind of prior cycles. So, I'd be curious how you think about that and how it flows through from a volume standpoint going forward? And related to that on just the volumes, what's your best guess as to why volumes are down from a consumer standpoint? Is the pantry destocking, unloading? Does that imply that they're potentially as reloading at a later time if and when consumer sentiment improves? Thanks. Andre Schulten : Hey, Mark. I'll take the first crack. I think the concept of irresistible superiority is : A, dynamic and must-be dynamic; and B, is relevant across value tiers. So, as consumers get more careful with their spending for example, that just means we need to double down on our view of what superiority and some of our lower value tiers means. So, if you think about diapers in the U.S. for example, we have Luvs, which is about half the price of a Swaddlers diaper. And that means that we need innovation on Luvs, because we're now competing with private label and we need to make sure as consumers look for value, that brand can stand on its own from a product, packaging, communication and retail execution standpoint to provide value to those consumers. So, it's really not a strategy that by default drives trade up. It's a strategy that follows the consumer and is grounded in what the consumer needs and wants over time, so if we get more stress, that just means we need to double click on the type of innovation and investment we need. From a consumption standpoint, as pricing goes into the market, we generally see consumers reacting with what you've described. If there are pantry inventories available, they, for a period of time, draw down those inventories. And recall coming out of the pandemic, I think Jon mentioned this earlier, there were increased pantry inventories available across multiple categories. So, I think that's part of the effect that we've seen. I wouldn't expect any major restocking, because I think we're just returning to our normal levels. As supply stabilizes, it's kind of the COVID pandemic goes more into the past, I think consumers return to their normal behaviors. The other element we're seeing is more careful usage. If you're overall made aware of inflation in everyday media, every day, you look twice before you use another paper towel et cetera. And partially, that's part of our value communication, right? When we talk about Charmin rollback because the product is more absorbent and has more strength, we explicitly talk about the ability for consumers to use less. So, it's really driven in those elements. Again, I think the job that we have as market leaders in many of our categories is to drive volume growth back to sustainable levels. And there's many levers. We still have huge household penetration opportunities around the world in many of our categories. We can create new usage occasions, create regimen use across many of our categories. Those are the things we're focused on. Operator : The next question comes from Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Nik Modi : Yeah, thank you. Good morning, everyone. I just wanted to follow-up quickly on China. Jon, maybe just given that you were there recently, just on the ground, consumer behavioral insights, like what are they going through right now? Are they just hesitating? And it's kind of like a choppy, \"Hey, maybe I'll check out, you know, outside and see if I get sick?\" I mean, just any perspective on kind of how the consumers actually behaving on the ground? Jon Moeller : Yeah. You can imagine with what many of them have been through. There's a bit of a whiplash aspect to -- for three years, I was told that going outside was dangerous. And now I'm being encouraged to reemerge. I'm living probably in a relatively small dwelling, many times with multi-generations, and I don't want to negatively impact my family. So, there is a degree of hesitance and questioning. On the same time, there's an overwhelming feeling, at least as I experienced it, of liberation, of hope. And I was in Beijing one sunny Saturday afternoon, and the streets were packed. It was absolutely wonderful and joyous. So, I continue to hold on and believe in the mid- and long-term opportunities that China presents us with. It's certainly -- plus 2 is a lot better than a negative number that we had in the last couple of quarters. So there is clear improvement. But I think it'll be a little bit choppy. And all it will take is a little bit of nervousness to stop the reacceleration of the growth. But I would -- my takeaway, Nik, is a positive one, but with near-term caution. Operator : Our final question comes from Edward Lewis of Atlantic Equities. Please go ahead. Edward Lewis : Yes. Thanks very much. I guess, I'll just cover a little bit of ground, but I'd be interested just on the enterprise market performance. Just looking in particular at Latin America, I think you said Andre somewhat 30% growth this quarter. And I think that'd be an acceleration around 20% in the first half. Assuming there's a healthy element of price behind that, but I'd just be interested here what's driving this improved performance in that region. Andre Schulten : There is a very healthy element of pricing there like in every other region, because we're pricing not only for commodities but also pricing for foreign exchange rate exposure in all of these markets. I think the positive effect is the volume is holding much better than in some of our focus markets. The consumer strength is there. I think the overall strength of the brands is better than we've ever seen. In-market execution is better than we've ever seen. Retail partnerships are better than we've ever seen. So, all of that I think is contributing to a strong price component with a positive volume component and that drives the 30% results of Latin America. Jon Moeller : Yes. Just for perspective, in our two largest markets in Latin America, Brazil and Mexico, as Andre is saying, we're seeing volumes high single digit. So, I don't want you to take away that all of the sales growth, as Andre has already said is pricing. It's a healthy combination. And I also need to give a nod to the team in Latin America who's just doing a fantastic job. Listen, I want to close-up with just a couple of comments and reflections. And the first relates to what we've been through and what I think it portends for the future. And then, I'll come in and talk a little bit more about the quarter that we just completed. But if we had a conversation three or four years ago, and you told me, \"Look, here's what's going to happen. We're going to have this thing called a global pandemic. People are going to die. Borders are going to be closed. You aren't going to be able to get to your largest markets and they aren't going to be able to get to you. You're going to have difficulty getting your colleagues into manufacturing facilities, innovation centers, sales offices. But don't worry, that's not all. We'll have the largest land war in Europe since World War II. The combination of foreign exchange and commodity cost inflation is going to wipe out half your earnings. You're going to see dramatic channel shift in some of your largest markets in terms of where consumers are doing their shopping. And when all that's over, you're going to find that it's difficult to get people to come back to work. How do you think you're going to do?\" And my answer to that three or four years ago would be that, \"Wow, do you think you can grow top-line, bottom-line, deliver cash and return that to shareholders through all that?\" Without taking you through the details, what you know very well, that's exactly what this team has done. Over the four years that ended last fiscal year, they created $13 billion in incremental sales, $5 billion in incremental profit. Now, if you bring that forward and look at what happened, what they accomplished in the last quarter, broad based sales growth, sequential progress in shipment volume, value share, volume share, return to gross margin expansion, strong productivity savings, at the same time healthy reinvestments in the top-line and advancing our level of superiority a margin of difference, in-market growth, in-household penetration, if those are the kinds of things our investors want to see, they're there in spades in the quarter that we just delivered. Last point, I promise, but we've talked several times, both Andre and I, about the challenges ahead, and they're real. We will continue trying our level best to do -- to serve consumers, customers, each other, society and clearly shareowners. But it's going to be, just as it has been, a bit choppy. And we're taking a long-term approach here. And if there are choices that are right for the long-term that cause bottom-line difficulty in the near--term, we're going to make those choices. And we'll talk more about that as we approach guidance for next year. But if you're thinking across mid and longer periods of time, I think we've got a great setup here, a great strategy, a great set of capabilities that should enable us to serve all those constituents that I mentioned very effectively. But we're thinking about that in years, not quarters. Thank you very much. Andre Schulten : Thanks, everyone. Operator : That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect, and have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning and welcome to Procter & Gamble\u2019s quarter end conference call. Today\u2019s event is being recorded for replay. This discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G\u2019s most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from these projections.  As required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business trends and has posted on its Investor Relations website, www.pginvestor.com a full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures.  Now I will turn the call over to P&G\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, Andre Schulten. Andre Schulten : With me today are Jon Moeller, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, and John Chevalier, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. I\u2019ll start with an overview of results for fiscal year \u201923 and the fourth quarter. Jon will add perspective on our strategic focus areas and capabilities and will close with guidance for fiscal \u201924 and then take your questions. Fiscal \u201923 was another very strong year. Execution of our integrated strategy continues to yield broad-based strong sales growth across categories and regions, strong earnings in the face of significant cost headwinds, and continued strong return on cash to P&G shareholders.  Organic sales for the fiscal year grew 7%, our second consecutive year of 7% organic sales growth and fifth consecutive year of 5% or better organic growth starting fiscal 2019 - 5%, 6%, 6%, 7% and 7%. Growth was broad-based across business units with all 10 of our product categories growing organic sales. Personal healthcare grew mid-teens, feminine care grew double digits, fabric care, home care and hair care up high single digits, skin and personal care, baby care, family care and grooming each grew mid singles. Oral care grew low single digits. Focus markets were up 5% for the year and we delivered strong results in our largest and most profitable market, the United States, with organic sales growing 6% on top of a strong 8% growth comp in the base period. Greater China organic sales were down low single digits versus the prior year, with trends improving in the back half as the market continues to slowly recover. Enterprise markets were up 15% led by Latin America with 24% organic sales growth. Ecommerce sales increased 7%, now representing 17% of total company. Our strategy focused on driving market growth is in turn driving share growth for P&G. All channel market value sales in the U.S. categories in which we compete grew approximately 7% in fiscal \u201923. P&G consumption grew ahead of fair share of category growth, driving modest value share growth and volume share up 50 basis points for the year. We held global aggregate market share. Twenty-nine of our top 50 category-country combinations held or grew share for the year. Importantly, this share growth is broad-based. Seven of 10 product categories grew share globally over the past year. Core earnings per share were $5.90, up 2% for the year despite a 24 percentage point earnings growth headwind, or $1.38 from share from higher material costs and foreign exchange. On a currency neutral basis, core EPS was up 11%. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 95%. We increased our dividend by 3% and returned over $16 billion of value to share owners, $9 billion in dividends and $7.4 billion in share repurchase.  Moving to the April to June quarter, organic sales grew 8%. We have now delivered seven consecutive quarters with 5% or better organic sales growth. Pricing contributed seven points to organic sales growth, mix was up 2 points, volume declined one point, improving sequentially versus the March quarter, as expected. These strong company results are grounded in broad-based category and geographic strength. Each of our 10 product categories grew organic sales in the quarter. Skin and personal care, personal healthcare, home care, feminine care, and family care, five of our 10 categories, each grew double digits. Baby care, hair care and grooming grew high singles, fabric care grew mid singles, and oral care was up low single digits.  Each of our seven regions grew organic sales with focus markets up 7% and enterprise markets up 13% for the quarter. Organic sales in the U.S. grew 6%. Importantly, this includes 3 points of volume growth, a return to positive volume in our largest market for the first time in five quarters. Greater China organic sales grew 4%. We continue to see sequential market recovery, but as expected at a slow pace. European focused market organic sales were up 12% despite volume pressure from wider pricing gaps. In enterprise markets, Latin America led the growth with organic sales up 22%.  Global aggregate market share increased 10 basis points. Twenty nine of our top 50 category-country combinations held or grew share for the quarter.  On the bottom line, core earnings per share were $1.37, up 13% versus the prior year. On a currency neutral basis, core EPS increased 22%.  Core operating margin increased 190 basis points as benefits from strong sales growth and productivity improvements more than offset higher material cost, foreign exchange headwinds, wage and benefit inflation, and reinvestment in higher media reach and frequency. Currency neutral operating margin increased 310 basis points. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 136%. We returned approximately $2.3 billion of cash to share owners in the quarter. In summary, we met or exceeded each of our going-in target ranges for the year : organic sales growth, core EPS growth, free cash flow productivity, and cash returned to share owners, strong performance again this year in a very difficult operating environment.  Now I\u2019ll pass it over to Jon. Jon Moeller : Thanks Andre. I want to talk briefly about this company, its strategy and our organization both as a step-back reflection on what\u2019s been accomplished and as a glimpse forward to what\u2019s possible.  Three quick reflections looking back : first, pre-COVID, during COVID and since COVID, pre-inflation and since inflation, consistent strong top line growth across categories and geographies, core earnings for share growth for each of the last five fiscal years, consistent cash return to share owners. Our strategy has sustained us through all of this.  Second look back, in the past two years, nearly half of our earnings wiped out by commodities, transportation and foreign exchange headwinds, yet we still grew earnings per share in each of those years while delivering 7% organic sales growth each year, increasing investment in innovation, brand building and growing markets, and growing market share in aggregate in the process.  As I said last quarter, if you told me four years ago that we would grow top line and bottom line and deliver strong cash return to share owners through a global pandemic with employees challenged to get to the workplace, in the context of a war in Europe, major disruption in global supply chains, rapidly escalating costs, the highest consumer inflation in 40 years, and fundamental shifts in consumer behavior and channel relevance, it would have been hard to agree, but that\u2019s exactly what this team has done. Over the last five years, they\u2019ve added over $15 billion in incremental sales, grown our share of the global market, grown core earnings per share by 40%, and returned over $80 billion of cash to share owners.  Two more granular examples testing both strategy and execution in some of the harshest conditions, Latin America - significant devaluation across all major currencies, inflation in Brazil peaking at above 12%, 9% in Mexico, over 70% in Argentina. Despite this, our team has delivered three consecutive years of U.S. dollar sales growth, mid teens in fiscal \u201922 and mid 20s this year. Market share growth on both a volume and value basis, nearly 30% profit growth this year in dollars, over 50% on a local currency basis.  One more test - Turkey, over the past two years, the lira has devalued more than 300%. We had to take multiple ways of significant pricing; still, the strength of our strategy and its execution by the organization has enabled us to grow dollar sales, grow volume, sequentially improve market share, and maintain dollar profitability in the market. As you well know, past performance is no guarantee of future results and certainly no excuse to stand still - quite the opposite. There will be bumps in the road ahead. We\u2019re still navigating through plenty of challenges right now. Each of these look backs, though, gives us confidence in the effectiveness of the strategy grounded in and focused on consumers and an appreciation for the capabilities of our talented, creative, agile and committed organization.  Our integrated strategy, a focused portfolio of products in daily use categories where performance drives brand choice. Superiority through innovation across the five vectors of product, package, brand communication, retail execution and value holistically defined. Leveraging that superiority to grow markets and our share in them to jointly create value with our retail partners. Productivity to offset cost challenges while funding investments in innovation, brand building, and market growth. We\u2019re re-accelerating productivity back to pre-COVID levels with an objective for gross savings in cost of goods sold of up to $1.5 billion before tax. We have line of sight to savings from improved marketing productivity, more efficiency and greater effectiveness, avoiding excess frequency and reducing waste. Constructive disruption of ourselves and our industry to adapt and create new trends, technologies and capabilities that often extend our competitive advantage, and an organization structure that\u2019s increasingly more empowered, agile and accountable, an increasingly diverse organization now with 50% female representation in manager roles across the world. We\u2019re strengthening the execution of our strategy in four focus areas. First with supply chain 3.0, we\u2019re driving improved capacity, greater agility, flexibility, scalability, transparency and resilience, along with greater productivity. We recently launched a platform of supply chain services to enable best-in-class service and streamline the end-to-end supply chain. These initiatives have been very well received by retailers. Our next step to drive joint value creation with retailers is to simplify our SKU portfolio, to improve the shopping experience, increase on-shelf availability and further streamline supply for the entire ecosystem, higher quality, more transparency, increased supply assurance, and higher on-shelf availability of our products. Each improves superiority with consumers and improves what is already the top ranked supply chain by our retain partners and third party industry surveys. All of this is a huge value creation opportunity for P&G and our retail partners. Next focus area, environmental sustainability, to create superior propositions for consumers, customers and shareholders while improving our environmental impact. Reducing the footprint of our operations, enabling consumers to reduce their footprint, and innovating to deliver cross-industry solutions for some of our most pressing challenges. Third, digital acumen, leveraging data and digitization to delight consumers, streamline the supply chain, increase quality, drive productivity, all driving shareholder value; and fourth, a superior employee value equation for all genders, identities, races, ethnicities, sexual orientations, ages and abilities for all roles to ensure we continue to attract, retain and develop the best talent. At the end of the day, P&G serves people with a strong desire to improve their lives and the lives of their families. We stand by people and support them in small but meaningful ways every day with superior performing products at a superior value. We strive to do this in the most responsible way, consistent with P&G\u2019s values and principles. This approach with consumers at the center and an organization built to serve them has served us and our many stakeholders well. It will guide our actions as we move forward. If we do this effectively, consumers will benefit, customers will grow their businesses, employees will develop and thrive, society will benefit, and shareholders will continue to be rewarded for their investment, not measured by a quarter or even a year but over time. I believe in this company, in our organization, it\u2019s capabilities and in the commitment of P&G people to serve consumers. I\u2019m excited about what lays ahead. Of course, I have my worries and concerns and we\u2019ll continue to face challenges and some dark days and nights, but the future in general holds great promise. We\u2019ll continue to be guided by our purpose, values and principles and relentless execution of our strategy to move forward to an ever-brighter dawn. P&G celebrates its 186th anniversary this year. I believe we have an even stronger hand to play today than we\u2019ve had historically. With that, I\u2019ll hand it back to Andre to outline our guidance for the new year. Andre Schulten : Thank you Jon. As we\u2019ve said in each guidance outlook for the past three years and as Jon indicated, we will undoubtedly experience more volatility in the fiscal year ahead, and while supply chains and input costs have become more stable as we enter fiscal \u201924, the challenges we face are multi-faceted: economic, geopolitical, and societal, putting pressure on consumer confidence and household budgets. We\u2019ll navigate these challenges with our dynamic integrated strategy guided by consumers with every step. Based on current spot prices, we estimate commodities will be a tailwind of around $800 million after tax in fiscal \u201924. Foreign exchange rates continue to be a headwind and, based on current rates, we now expect a $400 million after-tax impact. We still face above normal levels of wage and benefit cost inflation in our cost structure and higher costs for third party services. In addition, we expect below-the-line impact from higher net interest expense to be a roughly $200 million after tax earnings headwind. With this context, I\u2019ll move to the key guidance metrics. We expect global market value growth in our categories to moderate back towards a range of around 4%, with the drivers of market growth normalizing as we move through the year, pricing becoming less of a driver and volume returning to modest growth. With the strength of our brands and commitment to keep investing in the business, we continue to expect to grow above underlying market levels, building aggregate market share globally. This leads to guidance for organic sales growth in the range of 4% to 5% for fiscal \u201924. On the bottom line, we expect EPS growth in the range of 6% to 9% versus fiscal year \u201923 EPS of $5.90. This guidance equates to a range of $6.25 to $6.43 per share, $6.34 or up 7.5% at the center of the range. With a three-point headwind from foreign exchange, this outlook translates to 9% to 12% EPS growth on a constant currency basis. We expect adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% for the year. This includes an increase in capital spending as we add capacity in several categories. We expect to pay more than $9 billion in dividends and to repurchase $5 billion to $6 billion in common stock, combined a plan to return $14 billion to $15 billion of cash to share owners this fiscal year.  Top line, bottom line and cash guidance for fiscal \u201924 all consistent with our long term algorithm. This outlook is based on current market growth estimates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Significant additional currency weakness, commodity cost increases, geopolitical disruptions, major supply chain disruptions, more store closures are not anticipated within the guidance ranges. These guidance ranges also do not assume a further reduction in commodity and material costs versus current levels. If this should occur, it would generate greater flexibility to invest more in value-accretive innovation and marketing opportunities. With that, I\u2019ll hand it back to Jon for his closing thoughts. Jon Moeller : We\u2019re very pleased with the strong results P&G people have delivered in a very challenging operating cost and competitive environment over the last five years. Excellent execution of an integrated set of market constructive strategies delivered with a focus on balanced top and bottom line growth and value creation. We continue to believe that the best path forward to deliver sustainable, balanced growth is to double down on the strategy, starting with a commitment to deliver irresistibly superior propositions to consumers and retail partners  With that, Andre and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] Our first question will come from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Bryan Spillane : Hey, thanks Operator. Good morning everyone.  My question is revenue rebalancing is a real focusing for retailers, and I guess for you all as well as we kind of look into \u201924. Can you provide some color on how Procter approached this in its \u201924 operating plan, maybe comment on--I know we\u2019re getting questions, comment maybe on level of investment up or down, the mix between spending at the top of the P&L versus the middle of the P&L, and maybe if there are any segments or geographies that require more intention than others. It\u2019s a big issue, and just really want to get some color in terms of how you all approached it as you went into \u201924. Andre Schulten : Yes, good morning Bryan. I\u2019ll start. Look, our strategy is to grow categories, and that is the same strategy we\u2019ll execute in fiscal \u201924, and that means growing categories across volume and value. I think we take great comfort in the U.S. results, where we already see volume growth in quarter four of 3%, which is half of the growth we saw in the quarter of 6% in terms of sales.  Driving volume and value category growth, in our mind, is best done via innovation and by driving superiority across the five vectors that we have defined : product, package, communication, go-to-market, and value, and we see plenty of opportunity across our categories to drive household penetration, drive usage occasions, drive new jobs to be done with all physical and mental levers that are available to us, so we\u2019ll continue to invest in that direction.  We have plenty of innovation that is doing just that. Just to give you a few examples, if you look at China, Safeguard China is the number one PCC brand and Detox body wash, which is two times the market average price, has almost doubled in fiscal \u201923 and will continue to build on that strength by driving better awareness and even more awareness on that brand. In Europe, Ariel four-chamber unit dose and the ECOCLIC packaging, very strong results contributed to more than 20% sales growth in quarter four, and again we\u2019re just starting. That provides plenty of opportunity to continue to drive market growth. We just launched Cascade Platinum Plus - no prewash, no rewash, and again it\u2019s contributing to category growth and category share growth for us, so plenty of opportunity to drive. As to the balance between above the line and below the line, it\u2019s hard to grow categories in volume and value with promotion, so we tend to focus on innovation, superiority and communication investments. When we promote, we would like to do it in a strategic way, so that means driving regimen, for example, combining laundry detergent and fabric enhancers, so a high penetration, low penetration category so that the overall business for our retail partners and for ourselves. Generally, the promo environment continues to be relatively stable and we have no interest in changing that current dynamic. Jon Moeller : I would just offer a couple thoughts, Bryan, in addition to what Andre said. Pricing isn\u2019t going away in the absolute. It is linked to innovation and we have a very strong innovation pipeline, as Andre partially described. If you look back historically, pricing has been a positive contributor to our top line growth for something like 48 out of 51 of the last quarters, and again as we strengthen our innovation program even further, that will provide opportunities to continue to benefit from modest pricing. The second thing just to be aware of, and Andre mentioned it, when you have a strong innovation program, it compels consumers to try even better performing products, which typically involves a mix benefit, so you\u2019re going to have some amount of pricing going forward, you\u2019re going to have some amount of mix, which you saw for instance in the last quarter. Volume, the trend is very encouraging, as Andre said, both on a global aggregate basis - two quarters ago, volume was minus-6, last quarter minus-3, this quarter minus-1, and as Andre said, we\u2019ve fully turned the corner and are growing volume at very healthy levels in our largest market.  We also have--we will benefit from capacity investments that we\u2019re making currently. We have several categories in the U.S., for example, where we\u2019re currently on allocation on certain forms and freeing up that capacity to fully serve demand, so both retailers and consumers will help as well. Those are just some additional points to consider as you think about this question. Operator : The next question comes from Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Steve Powers : Hey, thanks and good morning, Andre, good morning Jon. I guess it\u2019s resolved the debate as to when you think you can return to on-algorithm growth - as you said, Andre, the \u201924 outlook implies that time is now, which is great. I guess the question I\u2019m grappling with is if you are fortunate to see upside as the year progresses, whether it\u2019s from further cost relief, productivity benefits, top line strength, etc., how do you think about using that additional flexibility? I\u2019m sure to some extent, the answer is you\u2019ll reinvest to stay within the algorithm range and preserve longer term momentum, but is there a point or a framework you\u2019d use to assess--you know, flowing through some of those benefits to upside versus the current guide? Thank you. Andre Schulten : Morning Steve. Yes, we\u2019re very pleased that we were able to guide back to algorithm for fiscal \u201924, and as it comes to incremental investment, should we see more momentum or more help from a commodity perspective, the principle we will apply is return on investment, so a very simple principle. We\u2019re not guided by money being available, we\u2019re guided by what is the best path forward to create sustainable value for our shareholders.  We have plenty of opportunity to invest partially in the direction that we mentioned before. You saw media spending, for example, ticking up in quarter four, partially because that\u2019s profiled with innovation and retail events, but as we further develop our ability to target more effectively and efficiently in the media space, we generally see a higher return on investment on every incremental dollar that we spend, so we will carefully push in that direction because we believe that more awareness on stronger innovation and superior products will drive the market and therefore will drive our growth in a constructive way. We also have plenty of opportunity to improve our service levels. As Jon said, we\u2019re adding capacity and we\u2019ll invest and continue to invest in our ability to serve our retail partners even more effectively than we have done in the past, and then we have plenty of opportunity to invest in future productivity. Supply chain 3.0, our digital capabilities, all of those follow the same principles - are they returning reasonable--are they giving us a reasonable return on investment. If they do, we will try to invest; if they don\u2019t, we let the money flow through to earnings. Jon Moeller : Yes, just emphasizing the point of ROI-based decision making. I don\u2019t--when we\u2019re discussing an opportunity in the market, whether that\u2019s in advertising, product supply, building capability, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever asked the question, where are we versus our guidance range in terms of the bottom line? That\u2019s just not how we think about things. We\u2019ve reflected a significant amount of investment that we\u2019re very excited about within the guidance range, and we\u2019ll continue looking for opportunities to build return, but that will be the focus. Operator : The next question comes from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Dara Mohsenian : Hey, good morning. Just want to tangent a bit off Bryan\u2019s question, more towards the payback from ad spend and P&G market share performance than the promotion and pricing side of things, which you covered. Obviously another quarter of strong organic sales growth. I know driving category growth is job one, but P&G\u2019s share gains were a bit more modest in the quarter and the fiscal year, so just wanted to get an update on your view of market share performance, how you\u2019re positioned going forward on that front particularly given the recent reinvestment into marketing and the levels of payback you think you\u2019re getting from that. Thanks. Andre Schulten : Let me start. I\u2019m sure Jon will add. I\u2019ll start by saying we\u2019re very pleased with our market share performance. We are holding global aggregate volume share and value share in the light of very strong pricing contribution to the P&L, which is a great outcome. As Jon mentioned, we see sequential progress in terms of volumes in the market and in our performance, which is the critical outcome as we enter fiscal \u201924.  When you look at the U.S., we continue to drive value share growth of 20 basis points and volume share growth of 50 basis points in the most recent reading, and when you look at our European share, our focus market shares, they\u2019ve turned positive in the past one and two months in European focused markets. All of those things give us great confidence that the strategy of driving superiority and providing value to consumers via innovation at the time when we price is working. Our vertical portfolio across value tiers and across price points in the markets is working, so we\u2019ll continue to double down in that direction. From a U.S. share perspective, we see some trading into private label. Private label shares in aggregate are actually flat in the U.S. at about 16%, so not really growing sequentially, but if you compare versus previous quarter, as we have mentioned before, there is some volatility especially in family care, some in baby care where we would expect as private label and smaller brands return to the shelf, some of those record shares will decrease, and that\u2019s partially what we\u2019re seeing. But structurally, the business is in a very good place and we think we are well positioned to continue our journey on driving market growth and thereby expanding our share premium, which by the way included in our guidance where we said the market is going to grow 4% and we\u2019re going to grow ahead of the market. Jon Moeller : Only one point to add to that - I agree with everything Andre just said. As you\u2019re looking to see a correlation, Steve, between increased marketing investment in Q4 and market share, as I know you know, it\u2019s not instantaneous. If you just think about purchase cycles as one of the dynamics, we have categories where the purchase cycle is once every six months or once every year even, and so we look at it obviously over longer periods of time. Operator : The next question comes from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Please go ahead. Lauren Lieberman : Great, thanks. Good morning.  I was hoping to hear a little bit more about the SKU simplification program, because that was news. I know you guys just sent a good amount of time talking about supply chain 3.0, but I was intrigued by this new initiative. I was curious, I guess first geographically, are there particular markets where it\u2019s more pertinent? How far along are you on this process in terms of identifying where the opportunities are, and should we think about that as contributing to existing productivity programs? How does this interact with discussion with retailers and bringing innovation in the market - is it, like, a one-in, one-out? I don\u2019t know, just some more nuance around this program would be interesting. Thanks. Andre Schulten : Morning Lauren. Look, SKU simplification is a category opportunity, and it\u2019s a category opportunity globally across the categories that we operate in. It\u2019s a reality that a very small--that the bottom 25% of SKUs in the categories we operate in deliver a very small contribution to absolute retail sales, so as we think about even better serving our consumers and even better serving our retail partners, it is a logical part of an optimization program to find a better, more efficient shelf. The appealing part for us is the data that we have, based on images of our customers\u2019 shelves in terms of POS data, and the algorithms we have developed to analyze the combination of those two give us great insight on what the right shelf set-up should be and which SKUs we should really focus on with our retail partners to maximize overall sales throughput, and that\u2019s the opportunity we\u2019re going after. It is a program that runs across all categories and it\u2019s a program that runs across all regions. It will be ongoing as we reset shelves and discuss future innovation with our retail partners, and it is part of our program with our retail partners to drive efficiencies and part of our own productivity efforts, because as you can imagine, reducing SKUs in a very complex manufacturing environment frees up capacity and frees up cost, so it\u2019s a multi-benefit space but we\u2019ll take our time to ensure that we do it the right way. There is no standard simple way to do this, so it requires a lot of analysis and a lot of planning with our retail partners to do it right. Jon Moeller : They are very excited about this opportunity. As I meet with our retail partner CEOs and key managers in those accounts, they\u2019re very anxious to work together on this. A very important emphasis point is that this is sometimes looked at primarily through a bottom line cost saving efficiency lens. That\u2019s now we\u2019re approaching this, though that will be a benefit. We\u2019re really focusing on the opportunity, as Andre said, with a more powerful shelf to grow categories faster, and therefore it\u2019s a top line opportunity for us and our retail partners. We believe that if we do this well, what would normally be considered as some shelf distribution risk through a smaller line up, we can actually convey that into a stronger overall shelf. So it\u2019s multi-faceted, as Andre said, it\u2019s early days working through this, and it will be a category by category, account by account effort, but I think it holds significant opportunity. This is--you asked the question, Lauren, whether this was incremental to the previously communicated productivity numbers. This is part of that and part of how we deliver that, and again has top line benefit as well. Operator : The next question comes from Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Nik Modi : Thank you, good morning everyone. I actually had just two quick ones, Jon.  On China, can you just provide any on-the-ground color on what\u2019s going on with consumer? I mean, is this still about them feeling comfortable getting out and about in a more normalized routine, or is there something more economic going on? Then the bigger question is obviously supply chains have been disrupted for the past few years. I\u2019m suspecting innovation was disrupted as a result, but now things are getting back to normal. I\u2019m just curious, how do you--how would you frame P&G\u2019s innovation pipeline for fiscal \u201924 relative to a normal year? Is this going to be kind of a bigger year than normal, and then how do you think about getting the space, given that I--you know, what I understand is most companies are going to have a pretty heavy innovation year over the next 12 months, so I\u2019m just curious how you think about spending needs and the ability to get everything you want onto the shelves. Thanks. Jon Moeller : China, as Andre said in our prepared remarks, continues to recover, not at a significantly rapid pace but steadily, so our business in that country was up 4% in the last quarter and that\u2019s a big improvement from where it was in the first half of the year. There are--you know, there continue to be consumer confidence challenges driven by many factors in China, but again improving month on month. There are some fundamental underlying economic challenges, if you look for example at the employment rates of people in their 20s. It\u2019s very low right now--sorry, the unemployment rate is high, the employment rate is low, unemployment of as much as 20%, so there\u2019s a combination of things, but as always, I hold out great hope for China and our business in it. As I said, we\u2019re beginning to recover nicely as we speak. On the supply chain, several things happened as we rebalanced supply and demand. One is, and we\u2019ve talked about this before, we\u2019re able to focus more energy and effort, refocus more energy and effort on productivity, so that\u2019s a significant benefit and that\u2019s included in our assumptions on the guidance. It also makes it easier to get line time to innovate. We have a very strong innovation program that we\u2019re executing currently and obviously expect--as part of our model, we expect to do that going forward.  Our track record--to the point of how do you get things on shelf, our track record speaks for itself, so one of the innovations that Andre was talking about earlier, if you just look at hand dishwashing in the United States and Europe, Down Power Wash and Dawn easy squeeze bottle, those two innovations together drove 17% growth in that business last year, up 1.5 share points in the U.S., up, I think the number is 1.1 share points in Europe, and we\u2019re just getting started with the potential there. But that kind of track record behind innovation makes us a very compelling partner to our retail partners, and that specific example, as you would expect with those kind of numbers, had a significant impact on market growth, which is also of primary importance for them. They don\u2019t really, as you know, don\u2019t really care or aren\u2019t benefited by our share growth unless it is driven by market growth which they benefit from. I think we\u2019re in good shape. When we have great ideas, when we can increase consumer and shopper delight, we\u2019ll be fully present. Operator : The next question comes from Robert Ottenstein of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Robert Ottenstein : Great, thank you very much. Jon, you mentioned, I think in your introductory remarks, that your ecommerce business is now about 17% of total, which has probably doubled in three or four years. Can you maybe kind of stand back and reflect on what that means for your business overall, and maybe concentrating on the U.S., how does that change your relationship with brick and mortar? Has it had an impact on your shelf space in brick and mortar? How has it changed your supply chains, what added complexity it\u2019s given to you, and how has it changed your overall discussion with retailers? I know there\u2019s a lot there, but what are the key things and takeaways that we should get about what\u2019s been a pretty big transformation in terms of channels over the last three or four years? Thank you. Jon Moeller : Thanks Robert. It\u2019s getting harder and harder to distinguish between ecommerce and traditional commerce, if you will, even in our conversations with our retail partners. Most of the large brick and mortar retailers are emphasizing the development of ecommerce in different forms themselves and have had significant growth behind those efforts. Honestly, I have not been in a conversation that is zero sum in nature or that is any way combative in nature, more the conversation is how can we work together to fully satisfy our shoppers, many of whom prefer an ecommerce experience. From a pure business standpoint, we aim to be indifferent between channels. We want to have an equally attractive margin, which we generally do, at least in aggregate, and we want a share profile in the different channels that allows us to be indifferent and allows us to support consumers and shoppers in whatever their choice is, wherever they want to go. That\u2019s always work to do, but we stand today in a very good place. Last comment I\u2019d make is just when you think about the growth of ecommerce, in the year that we just completed, as Andre said, it was 7%. That\u2019s the same rate of growth for the total business, so there\u2019s not a tipping exercise that\u2019s going on here. It\u2019s really working to raise all boats. Andre Schulten : The only thing I\u2019d add is many of the initiatives we talked about are designed to benefit an omni environment, so both online as well as the physical store. When you think about SKU productivity, it\u2019s absolutely critical when you try to fulfill an online business from shelf because you need the holding power. When you think about supply chain services, our ability to fulfill on behalf of our retail partners directly from our DCs is a significant advantage if you\u2019re in an online environment, but also an opportunity for any brick and mortar retailer. All of those programs are basically channel agnostic - they serve any format within our markets. Operator : The next question comes from Andrea Teixeira of JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you, good morning. I have one for Jon and one for Andre. Jon, on the U.S. volume recovery, are you seeing more of a need to defend the entry level pricing with promo? I know I don\u2019t want to sound as if I don\u2019t appreciate all that you said about several initiatives on--not only initiatives, real market share gains in innovation, but I\u2019m just thinking of the private label and value brands you discussed. Do you feel comfortable with your price architecture as it stands now, and do you think that also related to the fabric and fem care basic capacity increase, so you\u2019re now on shelf and you can be more tactical in some price points?  Then Andre, on the cost side for fiscal \u201924, I think that you\u2019re calling a net benefit of $100 million in your net commodities plus FX and plus logistics. I understand that you used the spot prices, and to the extent numbers come in better than that, would you see more of a need to reinvest or potentially flow through some of the savings into the bottom line? Thank you. Andre Schulten : I\u2019ll start with the commodity question, commodity FX question. You\u2019re right - $800 million [indiscernible] help on commodities offset by $400 million in FX and $200 million in interest expense. A couple of points. One, as we\u2019ve talked before, it takes time for these effects to flow through the P&L, so generally expect them to be more back half weighted versus front half weighted. The same is true with any incremental help, so if we see incremental help, it can take up to six to nine months for it to flow through the P&L, so we need to keep that in mind. But I\u2019ll give you the same answer I think we\u2019ve given before, Andrea - we are ROI driven, and it\u2019s really less defined by do we get more commodity help or less commodity help, are we within guidance range or outside of guidance range. The discussion is, is this the right investment to drive the strategy and create sustainable value, and if it is, we\u2019ll do everything possible to make the investment work. Obviously if commodity help is coming, that\u2019s an easier decision, but we\u2019ll be 100% ROI driven both in the short term and the long term investments. Jon Moeller : As relates to opening price points, that\u2019s a very fair question and something that we\u2019re always evaluating, as you would expect. But there are several tools that we have available to us to ensure that we\u2019re providing good value to consumers for whom price becomes a challenge. We have pack size, ensuring that we have pack sizes that are accommodated within their cash outlay capacity. Making sure that we have offerings that are right for the channels that consumers typically go to when they come under economic pressure. Ensuring that whether it\u2019s on the package, whether it\u2019s on the shelf, whether it\u2019s in advertising, we\u2019re clearly communicating the value that those offerings provide, and I think you\u2019ll see us going to the utilization of those tools much more frequently to fully delight and satisfy that shopper than we will simply price. Operator : The next question comes from Callum Elliott of Bernstein. Please go ahead. Callum Elliott : Hi, thanks for the question. I wanted to drill a little bit more into reinvestment, please, and from a different angle. My question really is about retail media spend. We\u2019ve seen a lot of hype, if I can put it that way, about the potential of retail media from the retailers themselves, and in particular the potential for CPG retail media spend to be incremental for the retailers. My question is, can you talk a bit about retail media spend from your perspective, who\u2019s responsible for it within your business - is it the brand teams or your customers teams, and is there a risk that this really will need to be incremental spend or is it just shifting from shopper marketing dollars and legacy media channels? Thank you. Andre Schulten : I can start and then Jon, if you want to add. For us, any type of media spend, whether it\u2019s digital, online, OTT, TV, print or, as you say, customer media, is part of the total mix, so what we\u2019re looking to do is optimize our reach effectively with a target and a frequency across all of those different touch points, and just like any other channel, retailer media needs to earn its place in our marketing mix model based on the relative return that it can provide. Now, are we working with our retail partners to maximize that return? Absolutely. There are plenty of opportunities in data sharing, combing transaction data with media data to optimize, and that is a strong reason why retailer-based marketing spending can make sense. But it is part of the overall marketing mix and it\u2019s managed in that way, so really it\u2019s the brand teams that are managing their overall mix and they are collaborating closely with the customer teams, because in many cases, a well timed investment in retail and media in line with merchandising plans on the floor or online can provide superior return on investment. Jon Moeller : I like generally the concept of retailer media managed in just the way that Andre described, because I just generally believe that the majority of brand choice is made in a retail environment. If we can bring that all together, it offers significant opportunity. I think less brand choice is made sitting on a couch or even driving in a car on the way to a retail establishment. The same is true for online. We\u2019re very carefully evaluating this opportunity, but it will be done in a context that Andre described. Operator : The next question comes from Olivia Tong of Raymond James. Please go ahead. Olivia Tong : Great, thank you very much. Two questions, first on cost savings. That obviously improved materially as the year progressed, so do you feel like this is a sustainable improvement from here, or to what extent does this perhaps reflect an elevated level after last year\u2019s was a little bit depressed? My second question is just realizing [indiscernible] strong innovation and that\u2019s led to a greater consumer willingness to stay with your premium brands. You alluded--you just talked about Dawn, for example, and that\u2019s obviously driven your ability to grow the category even when consumer are trading down to private label in certain instances, so perhaps you can talk about your innovation plans for fiscal \u201924, how they compare to years past. Thank you. Andre Schulten : Morning Olivia. On the cost saving side, we are very confident in our previous statements that we will return to pre-COVID levels across cost of goods, media savings, and general productivity on the overhead side, and I think you saw that play out in quarter four. As line time becomes available, as we have more time with our suppliers, for example, as we start to implement supply chain 3.0, we\u2019re very confident in our ability to create up to $1.5 billion of net savings within the supply chain. We continue to generate significant amount of savings via our media programs, and every business is looking at productivity opportunities to balance labor and wage cost inflation within the overhead structure, so I think quarter four is a good indication that we are able to do just that - get back to pre-COVID levels of productivity within those buckets that I described. In terms of innovation, what I\u2019d tell you is, number one, we never stopped innovation, so we prioritized strong innovation throughout COVID and supply chain struggles because we knew that was the only way to create value for our retail partners and for our consumers as we had to take significant pricing in addition to productivity to offset the commodity cost increases that we saw. It\u2019s also important to register that our innovation is not just premium innovation. We are innovating across all value tiers because the concept of superiority requires us to be competitive or superior at every price tier, so on a brand like Luvs, for example, which is a value brand in diapers in the U.S., we\u2019re competing against private label offerings, so we need to be able to be superior and have the right innovation to do just that.  I continue to see us very strong on innovation capability. We gave you a list of examples. There are plenty more, and I think the biggest strength we have is the hit rate that we\u2019ve been able to demonstrate is very good, and as Jon mentioned, that gives confidence to retailers to support our innovation, which is the biggest help that we can get in addition to just truly consumer-based innovation, having the support of our retail partners to bring it on and to drive category growth, and that allows us to create sustainable share growth for us. Operator : The next question comes from Peter Grom of UBS. Please go ahead. Peter Grom : Thanks Operator, and good morning everyone. I was hoping to get some color in terms of how to think about the gross margin progression. You mentioned in response to Andrea\u2019s question about the $800 million of deflation will be more back half weighted, but it still seems you will have some healthy tailwinds from productivity and price, so just any thoughts in terms of how to think about the [indiscernible] of gross margin as commodity cost pricing and productivity evolves, just in the context of such strong momentum exiting this year. Thanks. Andre Schulten : Morning Peter. Look, I\u2019ll leave it we\u2019re starting--just starting to recover a lot of the gross margin that was impacted by the commodity cost inflation. Obviously our objective is to continue to recover and get back to pre-COVID levels and then grow from there. Our algorithm requires with mid single digit top line growth, mid to high single digit EPS growth requires somewhere between 20 and 60 basis points of operating margin expansion, and a part of that will have to come from gross margin expansion because, as we said, we strive to continue to invest in the business across innovation, across communication to drive superiority. I won\u2019t give you detailed guidance, but we\u2019re still on the path to recovering back to pre-COVID levels. Operator : The next question comes from Filippo Falorni with Citi. Please go ahead. Filippo Falorni : Hey, good morning everyone. Just a clarification on your organic sales growth guidance. You mentioned you expected global markets to grow 4% with modest growth in volume. Can you break down what are you expectations for your volume assumptions for \u201924, and even just in terms of cadence, could we see, given the strong improvement that you saw in Q4, some volume growth at a total company level even in the first half of the year, or do you think it\u2019s more of second half in terms of volume growth for P&G? Thank you. Andre Schulten : Yes, maybe starting by deconstructing the global market growth number, we expect a point to a point and a half of that over our fiscal year to come from volume, so these are global market growth numbers, a point to a point and a half in volume. Same amount from mix, same amount from price. We strive to grow ahead of that. What exactly the composition of our growth is, I think will depend and we\u2019ll see, though if I had to give you a number, I don\u2019t think I could at this point in time. We expect sequential progress on the volume line, let\u2019s put it that way, and we will do everything possible to make that progress happen by driving market growth, because specifically on the volume side, that will be the most constructive way to drive our growth in \u201924. Operator : The next question comes from Chris Carey of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Chris Carey : Hey, good morning. Just two quick questions from me. First, with leverage where it\u2019s trending, free cash flow generation strong, why not buy back more stock or be guiding to more buybacks for the year? Second, good progress on SK-II in the quarter. Can we just get any context on where you think the brand sits today, some of the channel health and--it seems to be quite an important driver of growth, and just want to get some context on whether we can get back to those sorts of--you know, that sort of contribution on a more durable basis going forward. Thanks so much. Andre Schulten : Got it. Yes, Chris, on free cash flow, I\u2019ll just tell you our capital allocation priorities haven\u2019t changed. We\u2019ll fully fund the business. We will pay the dividend, we will do M&A where it makes sense, and then we will return cash via share repurchase. Just keep in mind, we had two years where operating income was severely limited because of the recovery of commodity cost increase and foreign exchange, so that explains, I think, a little bit of that share repurchase number being a little bit lower. If you look at the average, we\u2019re still returning $14 billion to $15 billion to share owners, which is right in line with what we\u2019ve been doing over previous years. On SK-II, 20% growth in the quarter looks great on the headline. Just keep in mind, we\u2019re building that off of a very weak base period with Shanghai lockdowns, so I wouldn\u2019t want you to extrapolate that straight into fiscal \u201924. I think most importantly, the team is doing a great job in putting SK-II on a solid footing both from a channel perspective, making sure that the pricing across different channels - travel retail, l domestic travel retail and domestic markets, is in a sustainable place. They are investing in the core equity of the brand with a new campaign, and they are building retail support and trial. All of those things, I believe, are a good indicator of where we\u2019re headed, and early signs within China, for example, are very strong, positive consumer reviews and initially positive share growth, so we\u2019re headed in the right direction but probably not quite at the clip you saw in quarter four. Operator : The next question comes from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Please go ahead. Mark Astrachan : Yes, thanks, and good morning everyone. I actually ironically wanted to ask about SK-II, but more in a portfolio construct view. How do you think about prestige beauty fitting into your portfolio? I think it\u2019s been a question for years in terms of just go to market and synergies with the rest of the beauty business. You\u2019ve obviously done some selective M&A, not necessarily co-selling that with SK-II in certain businesses and markets, so I guess as you take a step back and look at the volatility, obviously it\u2019s partly COVID related, over the last three, four years there\u2019s been volatility there, markets improving but some signs that the go-to-market that existed three years ago, four years ago pre-COVID is shifting in terms of how you sell those products, so are the same synergies in going to market there today versus where you were a few years ago? Are you still getting the same synergies in terms of flow through to technology through using [indiscernible], and then related to all of that, how do you think about that current portfolio today? Does it need to be bigger, does it need to be shifted a bit in categories, or are you content with where you are?  Longwinded question, but all sort of related to SK-II. Thanks. Jon Moeller : As you know, we want to be present in daily use categories where performance drives brand choice, so we love SK-II in that context and it\u2019s performed very well over the years. But as you indicated, the more recent volatility is due to channel dynamics and COVID dynamics, all of which are beginning to turn more favorable. That will take a little bit of time, but this is a brand that we like. We have said that from a portfolio standpoint, there are two categories that we\u2019re most interested in from an acquisition standpoint, albeit in a very disciplined way, and those are the same two categories where we\u2019ve been making smaller acquisitions. Those two categories are personal healthcare and skin care. Operator : The final question comes from Bill Chappell of Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Bill Chappell : Thanks so much for squeezing me in. Just a question on grooming - one, I might have missed what was going on in Europe, so if you can kind of clarify that in the disruption; but two, this seems to be kind of the best category to gauge pandemic behavior, if it pulled back meaningfully during the pandemic. Obviously we\u2019ve had a reopening for the past two years, so can you maybe give us the state of the state of that industry as we go into what looks like a normalized next 12 months? Are we normalized, or--I don\u2019t know if we\u2019re even back to where we were in 2019. Thanks. Andre Schulten : Yes, look - if you look at the grooming business, I would first tell you the last two quarters have been very strong quarters. The Braun business, so the more appliance side of the business had been annualized a very strong base period during the pandemic as more and more folks have brought some of these jobs in-house versus going to barber shops or beauty salons, and obviously that had a very high base so we\u2019re annualizing that base. On the core grooming side when you think about male blades and razors, female hair removal or beard care, I think the business has done a fantastic job in expanding the jobs to be done that we cover, and driving honestly market growth across each of those segments, and that will continue.  In terms of future outlook, we feel very good about the business recovering already in the second half, mainly from the mainly from the Braun strong base period, and I think the plan for current fiscal year are strong. Jon Moeller : I want to thank everybody for your time this morning. We appreciate it. We know this is a busy morning for you. We\u2019ll let you get onto other things. I just want to provide one last recognition of the team here at P&G who is working hard to serve consumers, customers, each other, society, and of course our share owners.  Thank you for your interest. Andre Schulten : Thanks everyone. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to Procter & Gamble's quarter-end conference call. Today's event is being recorded for replay. This discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections. As required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business trends and has posted on its Investor Relations website www.pginvestor.com a full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Now, I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer, Andre Schulten. Andre Schulten : Good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today is John Chevalier, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. This fiscal year, Jon Moeller, Chairman, President and CEO, will join the mid-year and year-end calls and I'll be leading the Q1 and Q3 calls. Execution of our integrated strategy draws strong results in the July to September quarter. Broad-based organic sales growth across categories and regions, global aggregate market share growth, strong productivity savings enabling increased investment in superiority of our brands while also delivering very strong earnings growth. These strong first quarter results put us on track to deliver towards the higher end of our fiscal year guidance ranges for organic sales growth and core earnings per share, and continued strong cash productivity and cash return to share owners. So moving to first quarter numbers, organic sales grew 7%. Pricing added 7 points to sales growth, and mixed contributed 1 point. Volume rounded down to a decline of 1 point with overall modest volume growth outside greater China. Top-line growth was broad-based across business units with each of our 10 product categories growing organic sales. Home care grew low teens, personal healthcare was up double digits, feminine care, oral care, fabric care, hair care and grooming, each grew high single digits. Baby care and family care were up mid-singles, skin and personal care grew low singles. Growth was also broad-based across geographies, with five of seven regions growing organic sales. Focus markets grew 6% for the quarter, organic sales in the US were up 7% and Europe focus markets were up 15%. Greater China organic sales were down 6% versus prior year. Underlying market growth is soft and choppy as consumer confidence remains weak. SK-II was down low teens in Greater China due to soft market conditions and a temporary reduction in social retail merchandising. Enterprise markets were up 13%, with Latin America up 19%, and Europe enterprise markets up 15%. Shipment volume in the US grew 3% again this quarter and we returned to volume growth in Europe focus markets. Mexico, Brazil and India, some of our largest enterprise markets, continue to deliver volume growth. These gains largely offset volume declines in the Greater China, Asia Pacific and European enterprise regions primarily driven by underlying market contraction. Global aggregate value share was up 40 basis points versus prior year, with 32 of our top 50 category country combinations holding or growing share. In the US, all outlet value share was up 50 basis points versus prior year with seven of 10 categories holding or growing value share in the quarter. US volume share was up 60 basis points, reflecting 3% volume growth. Value share in European focus markets was up 40 basis points over the past three months. Moving to the bottom line, core earnings per share were $1.83, up 17% versus prior year. On a currency-neutral basis, core EPS increased 21%. Core operating margin increased 240 basis points, as 460 basis points of gross margin expansion were partially offset by increased marketing investments, wage and benefit inflation, and foreign exchange impacts on SG&A. Currency-neutral core operating margin increased 340 basis points. Productivity improvements were a 210 basis point help to the quarter. Adjusted free cash for productivity was 97%. We returned $3.8 billion of cash to share owners, approximately $2.3 billion in dividends, and $1.5 billion in share repurchase. In summary, against what continues to be a challenging and volatile operating environment, a very good start to the fiscal year across top-line, bottom line, and cash. Our team continues to operate with excellence, executing the integrated strategy that has enabled strong results over the past five years, and that is the foundation for balanced growth and value creation. A portfolio of daily use products, many providing cleaning, health, and hygiene benefits in categories where performance plays a significant role in brand choice. Ongoing commitment to and investment in irresistible superiority across the five vectors of product, package, brand communication, retail execution, and value across each price tier we compete. We are again raising the bar on our superiority standards to reflect the dynamic nature of this strategy. Productivity improvement in all areas of our operations to fund investments in superiority, offset cost and currency challenges, expand margins and deliver strong cash generation. An approach of constructive disruption, a willingness to change, adapt, and create new trends and technologies that will shape our industry for the future, especially important in the volatile environment we're in. Finally an organization that is more empowered, agile, and accountable. We continue to improve the execution of the integrated strategy with four focus areas, supply chain 3.0, digital acumen, environmental sustainability, and the employee value equation. These are not new or separate strategies. They are necessary elements in continuing to build superiority, reduce costs to enable investment and value creation, and to further strengthen our organization. Our strategic choices on portfolio, superiority, productivity, constructive disruption and organization reinforce and build on each other. When executed well, they grow markets which in turn grow share, sales and profit. We continue to believe that the best path forward to deliver sustainable top and bottom-line growth is to double down on these integrated strategies, starting with a commitment to deliver irresistibly superior propositions to consumers and retail partners fueled by productivity. Moving to guidance. As I mentioned, we expect the environment around us to continue to be volatile and challenging from input costs, to currencies, to consumer and geopolitical dynamics. We attempt to reflect these realities in our guidance ranges. Based on current spot prices, we estimate commodities will be a tailwind of around $800 million after tax in fiscal \u201824. This is consistent with the outlook we provided in July. However, within this estimate, there have been several moving parts. We've seen incremental relief on some commodities like pulp, which have been offset by higher costs than other commodities such as fuel. Foreign exchange rates have moved sharply against us, and we now expect a headwind of approximately $1 billion after tax, an incremental $600 million impact since our initial guidance for the year. In addition to these impacts, we are also facing higher inflation in wages and benefits, and we expect higher year-on-year net interest expense of approximately $200 million after tax. As we are just one quarter into the fiscal year, we are maintaining our guidance ranges for organic sales, core EPS growth, cash productivity, and cash return to share owners, with each solidly on track after a very strong first quarter. Guidance for organic sales is growth of 4% to 5% for the fiscal year. The range includes a normalization in underlying market growth rate that is likely to occur through calendar year \u201824 as the market laps the last wave of cost recovery pricing and as market volumes return to growth. For P&G, we expect 3 to 4 points less pricing benefit in each of the next two quarters compared to our first quarter results. On the bottom line, our outlook for fiscal \u201824 core earnings per share is 6% to 9% growth versus last fiscal year. We're holding the range despite the incremental $600 million after-tax headwind from foreign exchange. With now a 7-point EPS impact from FX, this outlook translates to 13% to 16% core EPS growth on a constant-currency basis. We continue to forecast adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90%. We expect to pay more than $9 billion in dividends and to repurchase $5 billion to $6 billion in common stock, combined a plan to return $14 billion to $15 billion of cash to shareowners this fiscal year. This outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates, commodity prices, and foreign exchange rates. Significant additional currency weakness, commodity cost increases, geopolitical disruptions, or major production stoppages are not anticipated within the guidance ranges. As you consider the cadence of earnings for the year, keep in mind that the back half of the year will see less pricing benefit as we progressively annualize prior year increases. We should also see less commodity benefit as we move through the year. Labor inflation continues throughout the supply chain and [in our] (ph) costs. FX headwinds will increase versus quarter one. Also with a strong start to the year, we'll be reinvesting to further strengthen our plans and to maintain strong momentum. Finally, we'll be closely watching the health of the China market and the balance of regions, energy costs are rising as we head into fall and winter, household saving levels have reduced, especially in Europe. Slower economic growth, higher energy costs and higher interest rates for longer have an impact on consumer confidence. To conclude, while we expect volatile consumer and market dynamics to continue, we remain confident in our strategy and the results that it delivers. We are focused on driving growth in our categories and we are committed to delivering balanced top and bottom-line growth and value creation for our share owners. With that, we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Steve Powers : Thanks. Good morning, Andre. I guess just picking up on your comments on organic growth over the balance of the year, maybe you could talk a little bit more about how you're thinking about the progression of price versus volume versus mix over the remainder of the year. And then I'm curious as to whether your approach to balancing those various drivers differs at all between your focus markets, particularly the US and the enterprise markets where you're experiencing more of the currency headwinds? Thank you. Andre Schulten : Good morning, Steve. We -- as we said in the prepared remarks, we expect the market to return to a lower, more sustainable growth rate more in line with historical growth at around 4%. That will have a stronger contribution on the volume side. We would expect that to be around 2% -- 1% to 2% of pricing and maybe a point of mix impact. That will occur over the next few quarters and as always, P&G is intending to grow ahead of the market. So really, our expectation for the year is to be slightly ahead of the market in terms of volume and slightly ahead in terms of price. We continue to believe that we can price with strong innovation. And we have gained even more confidence over the past two years that our strategy of pricing with innovation to drive superiority and create value for the consumer is working. And so we fully expect to return to that pattern. And again, pricing has been a core component of our growth for 18 out of the last 19 years, so we expect that to continue. Specifically, I think the pricing will start to lap in quarter two. So you will see probably the price contribution drop to -- by 3 to 4 points in quarter two, and that was expected. And we then sequentially expect volumes to pick up and offset part of that but do expect a lower overall market growth rate for the balance of the year. To your second part of the question, enterprise markets versus focus markets, I think the only differential would be foreign exchange. And we'll continue to price for foreign exchange. We've done that very successfully across the world. Turkey is a major example where we've been able to price for the significant devaluation of the Turkish lira, but we are able to grow share, grow sales, grow profit. We'll continue that model. Outside of that, we'll continue to do and drive the same business model we're driving in focus markets, innovate, drive superiority, price, grow markets and thereby grow sales, profit and share. Operator : Next question comes from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Dara Mohsenian : Hey, good morning, guys. So just to follow up on that. Can you characterize what you're seeing competitively in terms of the pricing environment? Obviously, it will be different by geography and product category. But in general, what type of behavior are you seeing from your competitors? And any thoughts around retailer pushback as commodities have turned favorable year-over-year? And just then in terms of volume growth, it sounds like we should expect a return to volume growth. Just what you think your level of visibility is around that and how much comfort you have and ultimately returning to volume growth as pricing drops off? Thanks. Andre Schulten : Good morning, Dara. When you look at the total market, it's very consistent with previous periods. You still see average market growth of around 6% to 7%. And you see still the price component being a significant driver. Volumes are stabilizing at a global level. Minus a point to flat, depending on the geography. You look at the only exception being Greater China. So the price component and the price rollover is consistent period-over-period. So no differentiation there from a competitive standpoint, at least not that we see it. Promotion continues to be -- promotion levels and other indicator continue to be below pre-COVID levels. In the US, for example, volumes sold on deal is now at about 29%. Overall promotion level is still [indexed 80] (ph) versus pre-COVID. In Europe, we also see promotions still down and actually sequentially decreasing. Now it's a different dynamic by market, obviously, but when we aggregate up, it looks like over the past few quarters, promotion activity is actually still decreasing. And that makes sense. If you look at the relatively little or small help to commodity costs, we see about $800 million after-tax help offset by about $1 billion of foreign exchange. And recall, we're coming from two years, which combined have an impact of $7 billion of headwinds. So I think everybody is still recovering so the current pricing dynamic makes sense. We have not experienced retailer pushback beyond normal discussions on how to maximize value for their shoppers and for consumers overall. And again, our model of driving innovation and therefore, superiority and sales, while we price and create value for retailers and shoppers seems to be resonating. On the volume side, we feel very good about where we are in the trajectory of volume growth. Again, excluding China, we're already seeing volume growth of 20 basis points, sequential improvement in -- versus the prior quarters, which we would have expected. And again, that's in the context of 7% pricing still flowing into the market. We expect volumes will continue to grow. US strong. As we said, Europe, strong. Latin America and India are strong. So we continue to see us progressing on that trajectory. Dara Mohsenian : Great. Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Rob Ottenstein of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Rob Ottenstein : Great. I want to drill in on China a little bit. Number one, kind of in the short term, how is the business there progressing? Any visibility or improvement there? And when do you think that may turn positive? And then, a little bit longer term or kind of strategically, we are hearing from some of the other companies we talk to that the Chinese market may not be as profitable and attractive as perhaps they may have thought a number of years ago and that perhaps the nature of competition is changing in China again. So I'd love to get your thoughts on both China in the short term and the long term. Thank you. Andre Schulten : Thanks, Rob. Good morning. I think we said all along that we don't expect the China recovery to be quick, extensive or linear. And I think that's playing out. The business health in China is really all driven by market dynamics right now. So total market volume continues to be down. It has been down over the past few quarters between 7% and 9%. Value is down around 5% over the past few quarters, and that's the market I'm describing. So we're operating within a market that is still contracting post-COVID reopening. That said, we do believe that China continues to be an attractive place for us to do business. We've been there for 30 years. We have a very strong organization on the ground, R&D capability, supply chain capability and commercial capability. The Chinese consumer is a demanding consumer. The Chinese retail environment is a demanding retail environment and that generally plays to our strength. So we believe that, a, we can play a value-creating role in China, and we expect the Chinese market to return to mid-single-digit growth here over the coming periods. If you just look at the consumer structures, middle-income consumers, we have about 450 million, we estimate in China today. That will grow probably north of 700 million over the next five years. So there is a class of consumers that we believe are attractive for our businesses. And therefore, we believe that our business in China can create significant value over the next few years and we'll continue to remain invested. Operator : The next question comes from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Please go ahead. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks. Good morning. You've mentioned a return to volume growth in European focus markets, which is great to see, and obviously, market shares have generally held up well. But we started to see some pickup in private label share trends across Europe. You mentioned the European consumer being under pressure. So just kind of curious maybe some more broad thoughts there on Europe on market share trends that you're seeing more real time versus what's kind of already transpired in the reported results, more the go-forward look on European shares and volume trends? Thanks. Andre Schulten : Yep. Good morning, Lauren. Thank you. Look, the European -- let me focus here on the Western European side because I think that's where your question is relevant. Look, we've seen 15% organic sales growth in Europe focus markets, which is incredibly strong, a combination of 2% volume growth and strong price/mix. We have 40 basis points of share growth across the same geographies that is returning to volume growth, and that generally are positive signs. Yes, private label shares in Europe are growing. They continue to grow at about an 80 basis point clip month-over-month. But that still enables us to grow share in the same geographies. And I think that share growth is enabled by a strong portfolio across different brand tiers, across different cash outlays. The fact that we are present in all relevant channels across Europe, and that allows us to effectively compete even as consumers look at the private label versus branded value creation, the balance seems to be still in our favor. Operator : The next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Bryan Spillane : Thanks, operator. Good morning, Andre. I guess I have two connected questions. One is, if we look at first quarter and even in your commentary about guidance, maybe higher end of the range, I know you've talked a lot -- you've talked a bit about some of the risks in the market. But just like what's been better so far this year is one question. So just that. And then related to that also, you talked about reinvestment. So if you can just give us some sense of kind of the sizing that reinvestment and maybe where those dollars are going. Andre Schulten : Good morning, Bryan. If you look at the first quarter, I think the -- we are encouraged by the combination of factors here on the consumption side. Again, volume -- return to volume growth outside of China, we expect the China to be choppy as we said all along. But even with China down, we've been able to grow 7% and that certainly has been encouraging to us. And the depth and breadth of that growth, both across value and volume outside of China is really encouraging us and giving us confidence that the model will continue to drive results that point to the upper end of the guidance ranges. On the reinvestment side, we will continue to look for opportunities to invest when the return of that investment is attractive. It won't be driven by availability of funds. It will be driven by ability to create an attractive return. Our first priority, as you can imagine, in this current environment is to invest in ideas that drive market growth. So investing in products, investing in innovation that is driving new jobs to be done, investing in media spending that is driving household penetration, investing in communication to the consumer that drives usage in the right way to drive better delight for the consumer will be key. A couple of examples. Ninjamas in bedwetters was a sleepy category. We entered a couple of years ago. The category is growing 7%. We were able to drive 60% of that growth, which is six times our fair share. Those are great examples where we can continue to invest, drive growth for the business, drive growth for our retailers and create value for shareholders. We continue to see opportunities in media as we get sharper and sharper on our targeting across media around the world and our [capabilities are scaled] (ph). The ROI gets better. So we'll continue to drive up reach. We continue to drive up frequency. And again, that is a core driver for us to drive household penetration, drive trial, which will turn into loyalty and repeat. The last bucket I will give you is investing in supply, resilience and productivity. Our supply chain resilience, we see as a core competitive advantage for our retail partners and for ourselves. So we'll continue to ensure that our capacity to demand ratio is where we want it to be. And investing in productivity, we believe, has a high payout and is critical for us to continue the investment in superiority, which is part of the business model. So those are the headlines, but be reassured, we'll do it on a very disciplined basis with return on investment as the top priority. Operator : The next question comes from Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you. Good morning. Andre, your comments about volume, I would like to drill down a little bit. You mentioned China. I believe you are still looking to a mid-single-digit growth and obviously, I understand the choppiness of the market. And you had SK-II down in the low teens. So I'm assuming for that to happen, you're expecting SK-II to gradually improve or lap easier comps as we go through the balance of the year. And then when you mentioned -- like doing the math when you said pricing, as we decompose your guidance, right, the 4% to 5% organic total company, you mentioned expect sequential 3% to 4% decline in the benefit of pricing, right? So it was a good 7%, so you would be implying to us 3% to 4% in the next two quarters. So with that being said, it implies in the next two quarters, some sort of improvement in volume, right, or at least some sort of inflection. So I was trying to figure that out in the context of what you said about China and what you said about total company, basically what it regresses to -- regresses to an improvement in China? Is that what we should be thinking? Andre Schulten : So first part -- good morning, Andrea. First part of your question, we obviously want to see SK-II return to growth but the volume impact of SK-II is relatively limited because the volume to organic sales ratio obviously is very high unit sales. So China, we believe, will return to mid-single-digit growth. When exactly that's going to happen is really hard to predict. And I would say, like we have delivered 7% organic sales growth in the first quarter with China down, I think we'll continue to operate, and not counting on China recovery as the core catalyst to growth for the coming quarters. On your sequential question on volume, you're right. As we said, the pricing contribution to organic sales growth will decrease 3 to 4 points over the coming quarters. And we expect volume to progress sequentially. The exact trajectory of that progression, I think, is questionable, and I won't make a prediction here. But I'll tell you that the progress we're seeing from minus 6% to minus 3% to flat -- to minus 1% to now flat, is pointing in that right direction. So we see we're on the right path, and we will continue to invest to drive wholesale penetration and create that volume growth in our business. Operator : The next question comes from Olivia Tong of Raymond James. Please go ahead. Olivia Tong : Great. Thank you. Good morning. Andre, you talked about the changes in FX and how you've been able to absorb that into the fiscal year outlook. Can you discuss what's embedded in your outlook in terms of the consumer, the economy? Obviously, increasing risk or concerns around trade downs, slower volumes and macros in general. So if you could talk about that. And then also your ability and -- your ability to switch between spending that is either net to sales versus operating expense in light of potentially volatile conditions. Thank you. Andre Schulten : Yeah. Thanks, Olivia. Good morning. Look, the consumer continues to be remarkably resilient. As we said in the US, the consumption levels are actually stable. Our volume share and our value share are growing. And that's true in Europe and in most parts of the world. And I interpret that as our portfolio doing exactly the job that it's supposed to do. And building a portfolio that is grounded in superiority in daily use categories that are nondiscretionary, I think, is serving us extremely well. We're able to add value, bring value to the consumer. And we are doing that in every tier, not just in the premium tier, but in the mid-tier and in value tiers across the world, which allows us to serve the consumer even as their spending preferences might change. Now, we haven't seen a significant change in their preference yet. If anything, consumers that are choosing P&G products continue to trade up within our portfolio. But you can see our ability to grow in markets even when we see private label shares expand. And so we don't expect a significant change in that profile. And we believe we are well set up to grow even if the consumer feels a bit of -- more of a pinch here going into the fall or winter season. The main intervention for us continues to be investing in innovation and continue to invest in media support to communicate the strength and the value that our brands can provide. We don't see a significant need to drive price promotion. Our focus, if we promote, if we look for in-store support is really to drive regimen. So we view it as a strategic tool to drive either trial or habit formation, i.e., regimen steps added to the laundry regime or the hair care regime, for example, because that drives incremental consumption, it drives growth for our retail partners and for us. In many cases, our innovation is strong enough to get in-store support, and that's really what we're after. When the product in and of itself generates enough traffic and consumption so retailers want to support it, that's the golden grade we\u2019re after. Operator : The next question comes from Chris Carey of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Chris Carey : Hi, good morning. I was wondering if you could expand on two categories, which have been important for volume growth and seemingly should be important ahead. Just first on laundry. We've seen an improvement, a reacceleration in trend. Can you just expand on what's driving that and the durability? And then second, in personal healthcare, I believe that was an important driver of volume growth for the quarter. Can you just expand on what exactly was driving that in the quarter and if you think those trends are also sustainable go forward? So I'm just trying to get a sense of some of the volume durability that we saw in the quarter go forward, specifically in the context of potentially some volatility out of China likely to persist. Thanks so much. Andre Schulten : Yeah. Thanks, Chris. Good morning. The laundry business is very encouraging. Results around the world are very strong. Let me focus on the US market because that's -- it's the biggest market and you have the highest visibility to. But if you look at the trends, they are very encouraging. We are now growing value and volume share in US fabric care. Value share has been flat over the past three months. Volume share has been up 1.6 points. So we continue to push the laundry business forward. We have record high fabric enhancer shares and we have record high laundry consumption in the US. Most importantly, I think, is the fact that we're driving 70% of the category growth in laundry, and we're driving 100% of the category growth in fabric enhancers. And it's really driven by strong innovation, strong superiority and doubling down on consumer relevant communication and in-store support. So I fully believe that this will only accelerate. And to your question, yes, it is sustainable because it's just in line with the business model. PHC is doing extremely well around the world. And obviously, the seasonality here plays a key role. Going into the season, we see strong results, which is part of the strength in volumes that you see. And the last part I'll leave you with is we've invested significantly and continue to invest in strengthening our supply capability in personal healthcare, which will be needed to support that strong growth going forward. But feel good about both businesses. And yes, I think the trajectory is absolutely sustainable. Operator : The next question comes from Filippo Falorni of Citi. Please go ahead. Filippo Falorni : Hey, good morning, Andre. Just a question on gross margin. Clearly, very strong, the performance in the quarter. Big inflection in terms of the year-over-year increase. You seem like you have pretty good visibility in the first half, at least on the commodity front. Can you give us a sense of how you're thinking the second half will play out, especially as pricing contribution comes down? Thank you. Andre Schulten : Good morning, Filippo. Yeah, when we talked about the cadence of earnings, I think it's important to understand the drivers of the gross margin expansion we saw in quarter one. And we expect some normalization of gross margin. We were certainly benefiting from a high price contribution in quarter one. And as we said, that price contribution will ease over the coming quarters. The biggest part of the commodity help, about 33% of the $800 million after-tax commodity help has materialized in quarter one. So that's a positive to gross margin relative to the balance of the year. And the foreign exchange rate headwinds will accelerate over the coming quarters. On the other hand, we will accelerate and continue to drive strong productivity. We will continue to drive trade-up and innovation. And we continue to drive every other element of productivity, not only in gross margin, but across the P&L and the balance sheet. But I want you to take away that the gross margin expansion in quarter one is very strong, but we have headwinds going into the balance of the year. Operator : The next question comes from Peter Grom of UBS. Please go ahead. Peter Grom : Thanks, operator. And good morning, Andre. Hope you are doing well. So I wanted to ask specifically on Latin America, 19% growth in the quarter, very strong. And you may have alluded to this, but are you already seeing a return to volume growth in the region? And then just thinking through the performance in the quarter, can you maybe just unpack what you're seeing in terms of broader category performance versus how much of this growth is a function of share gains? Thanks. Andre Schulten : Good morning, Peter. Look, the Latin America business is on fire. And I think it is on fire because we've chosen maybe opposite to the market to double down on superiority. When we saw the need to price for foreign exchange and commodity impacts in Latin America, the team made the choice to double down on innovation and price for the innovation and to offset foreign exchange rate, inflation and commodities. And that clearly has played out well. We are seeing growth in our categories, and we are seeing share growth in Latin America. The growth is both on the volume side and on the value side in the biggest markets, in Brazil, Mexico, for example. I think the biggest headwind that we have to acknowledge is Argentina where it's very difficult to make progress at this point in time, given the level of inflation, some constraints in terms of ability to price. So outside of Argentina, I can only paint a very positive picture of the Latin America growth construction. And again, it's grounded in the superiority of our brands. And I feel very strong about the sustainability of that model. Operator : The next question comes from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Please go ahead. Mark Astrachan : Thanks, and good morning everyone. Two sort of unrelated follow-ups. One, just on China. Given your commentary about the middle class, I think everybody's obviously aware that there's a growing middle class and that they'll ultimately consume more. But any sort of changes in your view about how quickly the middle class premiumizes purchases? Obviously, SK-II maybe sort of a one-off, but any changes there in terms of how quickly you think that they can go for more premium-priced products that potentially change how Procter thinks about its product positioning or portfolio positioning in the market? And then on the gross margin versus marketing spend sort of decision tree. If gross margin moderates, how do we think about the incremental reinvestment or marketing investment from an SG&A standpoint through the year? Would that inversely kind of move with gross margin? Or I should say, would it move with gross margin, meaning less gross margin expansion, less reinvestment? Thank you. Andre Schulten : Yep. Good morning, Mark. Look, I really don't have any more insights on the China recovery timing. You see the volatility in the market that will directly correlate with consumer confidence, income levels and therefore, recovery timing. I think we're hoping for faster, but we're prepared for longer would be my answer here. On the gross margin versus marketing spending side, we're -- when I say we're ROI driven, I really mean we are ROI driven. So there's no direct correlation between availability of funds and investment levels. If we continue to see strong response to the marketing spend, increases that we deliver in quarter one, I think there's a strong incentive for us to continue that level of investment. I also expect that our gross margin expansion and our overall growth contribution availability will continue to enable us to drive strong innovation and drive strong support of those innovations. That's part of the business model. That's why, again, it has to be a combination of driving very strong productivity to reinvest in superiority, to grow markets, and we have to keep that cycle spinning. Operator : The next question comes from Edward Lewis of Redburn Atlantic. Please go ahead. Edward Lewis : Yes, thanks very much. Another strong quarter in the US, seeing both volume and value growth. Just looking back at 2020 where you were dealing with obviously a lot of COVID headwinds, you were talking about growing about 4% to 6% as a sustainable rate of growth in the US. In light of all that's gone on in the past few years and seeing where we are in the US at the moment with the consumer, are you still comfortable with that range over the longer term? Andre Schulten : Look, I won't give you guidance on a market-by-market basis. I think the -- what is proving out is that the business model we're driving in the US is very successful. If we are successful in continuing to drive market growth, that will continue to drive sales ahead of that market growth for us while being sustainable because we create business instead of taking business from somebody else. If that model is successful, which I believe it will, I feel very strongly about the growth prospects of the US. And again, we're doubling down in every dimension of superiority. We're doubling down in every dimension of market execution. So my overall confidence in the US market capability and growth trajectory is very high. Operator, are there any more questions? Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Andre Schulten : Okay. Thank you very much for joining us today. Again, very strong first quarter in the year and we look forward to speaking with you. If you have any questions, John and I will be available all day. So please feel free to call or e-mail. Thank you very much. Operator : That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to Procter & Gamble's Quarter End Conference Call. Today's event is being recorded for replay. This discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections. As required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business trends and has posted on its Investor Relations website, www.pginvestor.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Now, I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer, Andre Schulten. Andre Schulten : Good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Jon Moeller, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Jon Chevalier, Senior Vice-President, Investor Relations. I'll start with an overview of results for the October to December quarter, Jon will add perspective on our recent results and strategic focus areas and capabilities. We'll close with guidance for fiscal '24, and then take your questions. October to December, was another strong quarter. Execution of our integrated strategy drove solid sales and market-share results and another quarter of strong margin progress, delivering strong earnings and cash results for the quarter. The strong results we've delivered in the first half of fiscal '24, enable us to raise our outlook for core earnings per share and keep us on track to deliver within our fiscal year guidance ranges for organic sales growth, cash productivity and cash return to shareowners. We continue to see the upper range on organic sales and core EPS as likely outcome for fiscal '23 - '24. So, moving to second quarter numbers, organic sales grew 4%, volume rounded down to a decline of one point as continued volume acceleration in North America and Europe focused markets was offset by softer shipments in Greater China, Eastern Europe and Middle East, Africa regions due to local issues in select markets. Pricing contributed four points to sales growth, consistent with the guidance we provided, mix was neutral to organic sales growth. Growth across categories continues to be broad based with eight of 10 product categories holding or growing organic sales this quarter. Home care, hair care and grooming grew sales high single digits. Fabric care, family care, feminine care and oral care were up mid-single digits. Baby care was in line with prior year. Personal health care was down low singles against a very tough comp and a late developing cold and flu season this year. Skin and personal care was down mid singles due to SK-II in China. Growth was also broad based across geographies with North America, Europe, Asia Pacific focus markets and Latin America and Europe enterprise markets each growing organic sales. Focus markets grew 3% for the quarter and enterprise markets grew 7%. Organic sales in North America grew 5% with four points of volume growth. Over the last five quarters, volume growth in North America has been minus three, flat, then 2% growth plus 3% and now plus 4%, strong acceleration well ahead of the underlying market trends. Europe focused markets were up 7% with three points of volume growth. As expected, both regions saw a step down in pricing contribution to sales growth as a large portion of price increases from last year have annualized. Importantly, volume accelerated in both regions to partially offset the pricing impact. Latin America delivered another very strong quarter with 17% organic sales growth, continued strong results in these regions. There are some targeted issues affecting other markets. Greater China organic sales were down minus 15% versus prior year. Underlying market growth was down mid to high single digits as consumer confidence weakened further. The SK-II brand in Greater China was down 34% due to soft market conditions and a temporary headwind for Japanese brands in the market. Our consumer research indicates SK-II brand sentiment is improving and we expect to see sequential improvement in the back half. Underlying market trends have softened in some Europe enterprise and Asia Pacific, Middle East, Africa countries such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, following multiple rounds of pricing to offset inflation and due to heightened tensions in the Middle East. Global aggregate value share was up 40 basis points versus prior year with 28 of our top 50 category country combinations holding or growing share. In the U.S., all outlet value share was up 20 basis points versus prior year. U.S. volume share was up 50 basis points reflecting strong volume growth. Value share in European focus markets was up 90 basis points over the past three months. In summary, North America, Europe focus Markets, Asia Pacific focus markets and Latin America, which combined represent three-quarters of company sales, delivered over 6% of organic sales growth in quarter two, with three points of volume growth and three points of price mix. These same markets grew 9% in quarter one with around two points of volume growth and seven points of price mix. Continued strong organic sales growth with accelerating volume growth to mitigate the anticipated annualization of pricing, consistent with our guidance. The balanced 25% of company sales including Greater China, Eastern Europe and Middle East Africa were impacted by local market issues we described. Quarter two organic sales for this group were down five points versus prior year. We expect most of these effects in these regions to be temporary or annualizing, SK-II consumption is sequentially improving. We continue to expect China market growth to improve, and over time return to mid singles, and we expect market pressures in the Middle east and Turkey to ease over time. Moving to the bottom line, core earnings per share were $1.84, up 16% versus prior year. On a currency neutral basis, core EPS increased 18%. Core operating margin increased 400 basis points as 520 basis points of gross margin expansion were partially offset by increased marketing investments, wage and benefit inflation and foreign exchange impacts in SG&A. Currency neutral core operating margin increased 470 basis points. Productivity improvements were a very strong 340 basis points helped to the quarter. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 95%. We returned $3.3 billion of cash to share owners, approximately $2.3 billion in dividends and $1 billion in share repurchase. In summary, against what continues to be a challenging and volatile operating environment, strong overall progress in the first half of the year keeping us on track for our fiscal year guidance ranges. Now I'll pass it over to Jon for his perspective. Jon Moeller : Thanks Andre, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by underscoring a few points Andre made in his discussion of the topline trends. Overall, continued strong top line progress 22nd consecutive quarter of 4% or better organic sales growth, volume acceleration in key markets, increases in aggregate market shares. This despite several notable headwinds, which should be temporary. Tensions in the Middle East will hopefully ease. Enterprise market volume impacts following price increases are usually temporary. While we can't talk specifics of future pricing in any market, more stable foreign exchange and commodity costs will ideally reduce the need for additional large price increases. I spent six days in China with the team two weeks ago. I met with consumers in their homes, with retail CEOs with our team, and with several government officials. In my view, the long-term China opportunity remains intact. The near term is likely to present some challenges. We'll see what happens with the global cough cold season as a soft start to the season either reverses or eventually annualizes. No guarantee of immediate bounce back in any of these, but reason to believe they will improve over time. In addition to continued aggregate topline progress, a very strong bottom line, mid-teens core earnings per share growth two quarters in a row, while increasing investments in innovation, brand building and market growth. Our team continues to execute our strategy with excellence, enabling strong results over each of the past five years, pre COVID, during COVID and through a historic inflationary and pricing cycle. I want to thank them both for what they delivered and for what they're working to continue to accomplish. Our integrated strategy is unchanged. A focused portfolio of products and daily use categories where performance drives brand choice. The portfolio is performing, delivering broad based growth across nearly all categories and most geographies for several years. The announcements we made in December to change our go to market approach in Argentina and Nigeria will further sharpen our focus and strengthen our value creation potential. A good example of the dynamic nature of our strategy and our desire to aggressively allocate resources to where they create the most shareholder value. Next strategy element, ongoing commitment to an investment in irresistible superiority through innovation across the five vectors of product package, brand communication, retail execution and value holistically defined. Leveraging that superiority to grow markets and our share in them to jointly create value with retail partners. The plans across the businesses are broader and stronger than at any time in the recent past as each team works to increase their margin of superiority and consumer delight. Superior innovations that are driven by deep consumer insights communicated to consumers with more effective and efficient marketing programs, executed in stores and online in conjunction with retailer strategies to grow categories and our brands, priced to deliver superior value across each price tier where we compete. Smooth tear Charmin Ultra Soft Smooth with scalloped edge perforations, a great example of consumer insights driving innovation to improve the in-use experience. Consumer response to the new product has been overwhelmingly positive and is driving word of mouth recommendations in social media. Gillette's superior propositions like the GilletteLabs razor with an exfoliating bar that removes dirt and debris before the blades, continue to drive growth in the global grooming category. GilletteLabs has reached shares greater than 20% in markets like Spain and France, and is building momentum in the U.S. and China. The global grooming category is on track for $1 billion of retail sales growth this fiscal year, with Gillette driving two-thirds of the increase, well ahead of our global share. Superior innovations like Dawn Power Wash and Dawn EZ-Squeeze in the U.S. and Fairy power spray and Fairy Max in Europe are disproportionately driving market growth in hand dishwashing with value share in the U.S. approaching 67%, merely 50% across Europe focused markets. Third strategy element productivity, improvement in all of our operations to fund investments in innovation, brand building and market growth, to mitigate cost and currency challenges, and to expand margins and generate cash. We're reaccelerating productivity back to pre-COVID levels with an objective for gross savings and cost of goods of up to $1.5 billion before tax. Visibility to more savings opportunity is increasing enabled by platform programs with global application across categories like supply chain 3.0. We're working in a new way with retailers on the totality of the supply chain, end to end, versus simply trying to optimize each piece. One example using data and machine learning algorithms to optimize truck scheduling to minimize idle time for drivers. We're also using AI tools to optimize fill rates and for dynamic routing and sourcing optimization, $200 million to $300 million of savings opportunity across these areas. We have line of sight to savings from improved marketing productivity, more efficiency and greater effectiveness, avoiding excess frequency and reducing waste while increasing reach. We're taking targeted steps to reduce overhead as we digitize more of our operations. The team has delivered strong cost savings in the first half of the year, and plans to build on this momentum. Next, constructive disruption of ourselves and our industry. A willingness to change, adapt and create new trends, technologies and capabilities that will shape the future of our industry and extend our competitive advantage. We continue to be a constructive disruptor of brand building, in-housing more of the media planning and placement activity, using our proprietary tools and consumer data to increase effectiveness and efficiency of our communication. We're disrupting traditional lab-based innovation models to dramatically increase the speed and breadth of discovery. Last but clearly not least, we've designed and continue to refine an empowered, agile and accountable organization model. Also, an increasingly diverse organization, enabling us to better serve an increasingly diverse set of consumers. So strong progress across all strategic pillars with significant opportunity ahead of us. No reason to stand still, as illustrated by the four focus areas we've outlined previously. Supply chain 3.0 is delivering productivity as we just talked. We're also driving improved capacity planning, greater supply agility, flexibility, data transparency, scale and resilience, all the way up and down the supply chain, inclusive of our retail partners. All of this was driving higher quality, increased supply assurance and higher on-shelf availability of our products, and of course better cash and cost structures. These programs improve superiority with consumers and further strengthen what is already the top ranked supply chain by our retail partners and third-party industry surveys. Environmental sustainability - superior propositions for consumers, customers and share owners that are sustainable, driving sales and profitability while reducing the footprint of our operations, enabling consumers to reduce their footprint and innovating to deliver cross industry solutions for some of our most pressing challenges. A good example is the four chamber Ariel platinum PODS innovation that we launched in a new cardboard package. Extending our superiority advantage in product performance while improving sustainability by enabling great wash results even in cold water, already contributing to a two-degree celsius reduction in wash temperatures in Europe against a five-degree target. Also extending packaging superiority with a more attractive and more sustainable cardboard box. Digital acumen - leveraging data and digitization to delight consumers, streamline the supply chain, increase quality, drive productivity, all driving shareholder value. Fourth - the superior value equation for all employees, inclusive of all genders, races, ethnicities, sexual orientations, ages and abilities for all roles to ensure we continue to attract, retain and develop the best talent, and are best positioned to serve all consumers. These four focus areas are not new and separate strategies. They simply strengthen our ability to execute the strategy. Our strategic choices on portfolio superiority, productivity, constructive disruption and organization reinforce and build on each other. We continue to believe that there is merit in doubling down on this integrated strategy, starting with a commitment to deliver irresistibly superior propositions to consumers and retail partners fueled by productivity. We remain as confident as ever in our strategy and our ability to drive market growth, and to deliver balanced growth and value creation to delight consumers, customers, employees, society and share owners. Now back to Andre for guidance. Andre Schulten : Thanks Jon. As I mentioned, we expect the environment around us to continue to be volatile and challenging from input costs to currencies to consumer, retailer and geopolitical dynamics. However, our strong first half results enable us to raise or maintain key guidance metrics for the year. We're maintaining our guidance range for organic sales growth of 4% to 5% for the fiscal year. This outlook includes a normalization in underlying market growth rates that we began to see in our second quarter results as the market lapsed the last waves of cost recovery pricing. For P&G, we expect the pricing contribution to topline growth to reduce by an additional 1 to 2 points in the back half of the year. We will continue to price for new innovations when warranted and to mitigate FX impacts. On the bottom line enabled by very strong earnings growth in the first half of the year, we're raising our outlook for fiscal '24 core earnings per share from a range of 6% to 9% to a range of 8% to 9% growth versus last fiscal year. This guidance implies slower bottom-line growth in the second half. As we highlighted last quarter, the second half of the fiscal year will see less pricing benefit as we annualize more prior year increases. We will also see less commodity cost benefit in the second half. Wage and benefit inflation continues throughout the supply chain and in our direct costs, and FX headwinds will increase versus the first half of the fiscal year. As I mentioned, we continue to expect organic sales and core EPS growth toward the upper end of the renewed guidance ranges. We estimate commodities will be a tailwind of around $800 million after tax in fiscal '24 based on current spot prices. This is consistent with the outlook we provided last quarter. We continue to expect foreign exchange will be a headwind of approximately $1 billion after tax for the fiscal year. The vast majority of this impact is driven by Argentina, and is heavily skewed towards the back half of the year. This outlook is based on a forecast for continued significant devaluation of the Argentine Peso, which we expect to largely offset with appropriate price increases. We now expect higher net interest expense of approximately $100 million after tax versus prior year. General inflation and higher wage and benefit costs weakness are also earnings headwinds for the year. We expect adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90%. We expect to pay more than $9 billion in dividends and to repurchase $5 billion to $6 billion in common stock, combined a plan to return $14 billion to $15 billion of cash to share owners this fiscal year. This outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Significant additional currency weakness, commodity cost increases, geopolitical disruptions or major production stoppages are not anticipated within the guidance ranges. Finally, we'll be closely watching the more volatile regions we mentioned earlier, including the health of the China market, and we'll be keeping close watch on competitive dynamics to ensure P&G brands remain superior value for consumers and retailers. Now, I'll hand it back to Jon for closing thoughts. Jon Moeller : We continue to be very pleased with the strong results P&G people are delivering in a challenging operating and competitive environment. Continued excellent execution of an integrated market constructive strategy. I want to thank each of them for that. While we expect volatile consumer and macrodynamics to continue, we remain confident that the best path forward is to double down on the strategy that has enabled strong results and remain committed to delivering balanced top and bottom-line growth and value creation for shareholders. With that, we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Dara Mohsenian : Hi, good morning, guys. So just wanted to focus on the back half. Clearly the 4% Q2 core sales growth result wasn't as strong as the 7% Q1 delivery, which is very robust result. So obviously some quarterly volatility here. Can you just give us some perspective for the fiscal back half relative to Q2 in light of that first half volatility as you think through some of the key geographies and volume versus price mix, and some of the temporary impacts Jon mentioned? And then just same question on EPS basically, obviously very strong first half that continued in Q2, full year guidance implies a more muted second half. So, is there some conservatism baked in there? Help us understand that. I know Andre touched on it, but maybe give us a bit more detail there on the back half from an earnings perspective. Thanks. Andre Schulten : Yes, morning Dara, let me start and Jon will add. On the top line, if you look at the first half, we are right in line with what we're projecting for the year, an average of 5%, and we obviously then expect about 5% for the back half. We see volatility, as you had pointed out in some geographies that we mentioned in the script. I think the core point though is the core geography, 75% of the sales are performing very well. We continue to see acceleration in volume growth in North America with 4% volume growth, 5% sales growth. Europe is very strong. Latin America very strong. We continue to see volume acceleration in most places. So that gives us confidence that that projects well for the second half of the year. We also expect some of the volatility that we experienced in quarter two to disappear or at least improve in the second half. The SK-II sentiment is improving based on our consumer research in China, and we are continuing to drive innovation, equity investment and really relying on our most loyal and passionate user base to help amplify that messaging, which is working well. So, we expect the effects to improve year-over-year - quarter over quarter. From an enterprise market standpoint, we also view the pricing impacts that are impacting some of the markets like Turkey to disappear over time, as pricing in the market is established, competitive pricing catches up and then the impact of the tensions in the Middle East certainly hopefully will improve as well. So very strong continued performance on the core markets, which are 75% of the sales, and we expect somewhat improving trends and stabilization in the other 25%. On the EPS side, very strong performance in the front half, 17% in quarter one, 16% in quarter two, sets us up well for the upper end of their guidance range, which is reflected in the tightening of their guidance. However, to keep in mind, we see a reversal of a number of effects that have supported the half one results. We saw the majority of the commodity help flow through in the first half, and this is part of the improvement in quarter two EPS. We see the flow through happening faster than we would have anticipated in some instances, so that leaves less of a contribution for the second half. We also have the majority of the foreign exchange hurt in the second half, about 75% of FX hurt of the billion dollars will hit the second half. As we indicated, the majority of that is Argentina, so we will try to offset via appropriate pricing. Nevertheless, the growth impact is tilted towards the back half. Price mix contribution will ease. We saw still significant contribution in the first half, that will lower by 1 point to 2 points in the back half, which also has an impact on EPS growth. And lastly, we continue to see wage inflation in our own operation as well as in our supply chain flowing through. Now, that being said, if everything goes well, could there be upside? Sure. But we believe that guidance is appropriately reflecting the potential variability here. So those are the core drivers. Jon, any perspective? Jon Moeller : I have nothing to add on Andre's bottom line perspective. I would just reiterate one thing and add one thing on the top line. There are two questions that we've been discussing as we've gone through the first half of the year. The first relates to our ability to reaccelerate volume, which we've talked about several times in this conversation this morning. And I just want to reiterate how encouraging that progress has been. We've said it before, but it's worth saying again in our largest market, North America, past five quarters, minus 30, plus two, plus three, plus four. Europe, which tends to be fairly price sensitive, volumes, plus three. So that gives us confidence in terms of the momentum of the business on a forward basis. The other thing I would just call out that adds to this discussion is the breadth of the top line progress that the team has been making. Eight out of 10 categories held or grew sales in the quarter that we just completed, 21 of our top 25 brands did the same. And if you look at our top 12 brands, nine of those are growing at high singles or better rates. And that's inclusive of all the challenges that we're managing around the world. So that gives us confidence that the top line growth that we've been delivering should continue, just as Andre said, and that should provide the ability to continue to deliver decent levels of bottom-line growth as well. Operator : The next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Bryan Spillane : Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. I want a clarification, Andre, to your answer to Dara's question. And then I have a question. So, the clarification, I think when you responded regarding organic sales growth for the back half and tacking to the year, the 5%, is it that Procter is tracking to 5% organic sales for the year? Or were you saying an expectation for 5% organic sales growth for the back half? I wasn't quite sure if you were talking full year or specifically about the back half. Andre Schulten : Hi, Bryan. No, what I was talking was the full year expectation. So again, we reiterate the range of four to five, but we see the possibility and strong probability that we'll be able to deliver towards the upper end of that range for the fiscal year. Operator : The next question comes from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Please go ahead. Lauren Lieberman : Great, thanks. Good morning. So, with the very sizable gross margin delivery this quarter and the outlook for the full year, there's a ton of reinvestment going back into P&L, right. And this quarter you called out the specifics, but I think know that's pretty well implied for the second half as well. So, I was just curious if you could talk a little bit about incremental areas of reinvestment because the basis points are big and the dollars are even bigger. And so, I don't know, like, it might sound ridiculous, but it gets to a point where you start to worry externally, is there an excessive amount of reinvestment? So, I'd love it, Jon, if you could talk through your perspective on that, on making sure there's not money effectively being spent less efficiently in the P&L simply because you have that much flexibility. Thanks. Jon Moeller : Are you saying, Lauren, that you want 30% core rates for share growth? Just kidding. Lauren Lieberman : Well, that's kind of what I'm getting at, right? Yes. Jon Moeller : All right, I'll speak first on this, and I'm sure Andre has some perspective as well. But if you look at the amount of innovation that's coming to market, both currently and in the future, and if you look at the opportunity to fully penetrate households with that innovation in ways that delights them and improves their lives, now is not the time to be pulling back on investments in marketing or commercialization efforts of that innovation. And that's where the majority of the incremental spend has come from and will come from, we look very carefully. I don't want to ignore your question on the effectiveness of that spend and continue to see through the addition of many tools and data sets that we can increase the effectiveness of that advertising, increase the return rates of that advertising as you see in our bottom line, while increasing reach. So that's what we'll be focusing on. We'll be very disciplined in that effort. Neither Andre or I or the rest of the team has any desire to spend money that isn't working for us. Andre Schulten : Yes. And maybe just to add, we just talked with our team actually about being very granular about the assessment of the ROI. So, we don't have good investments, cover for bad investments. So really go down to the country level, to the brand level, to the channel level when we assess whether we are getting a payout on the investments. But the majority of the spend, as Jon said, is really focused on driving market growth. When you think about the opportunity on FE, for example, we've created 100% of the market growth in North America on FE, and it's still the biggest opportunity the team has in order to continue to accelerate both our own growth in a constructive way and the market given the low penetration FE has - Fabric Enhancers. Oran-B, another example, a power Oral-B was launched - Oral-B iO10 and we're also expanding distribution of Oral-B iO3, 4 and 5. We've led 70% of global market growth with those launches. So, communicating the benefit and driving penetration is a huge opportunity. So be assured we look at ROI very carefully. And again, market growth continues to be the main area of focus when we invest incrementally. Operator : The next question comes from Robert Ottenstein of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Rob Ottenstein : Terrific. Thank you very much. I was wondering if you could go into a little bit more detail on the state of the consumer in your two most important markets, the U.S. and China, how consumer demand developed through the quarter and into January? And when you talk about China, if you could also touch upon travel retail and maybe what SK-II was on a greater China basis, including travel retail as well. Thank you. Andre Schulten : I'll start. Morning Robert. Look, the US continues to be very solid, continues to impress with I think a very smooth transition from pricing, annualizing and overall consumption coming up in terms of volume, which is enabling us to post the volume improvements Jon was quoting over the past few quarters, and still accelerating ahead of market with 4% volume growth and 50 basis points of market share growth. We continue to see trade up within our propositions. So as consumers come in, maybe at a lower tier and a lower value proposition, they continue to trade up in the U.S., which speaks to the health of the proposition but also the health of the consumer and willingness to invest. The last data point I'll give you on the U.S. is we are able to grow as private label shares are slightly up, we are up the same range. So, some consumers will look for value in private label, but an equal if not higher amount of consumers find better value in our propositions as we drive continued superiority via innovation. So, feel very strongly about the U.S., we'll continue to invest to drive more market growth there, but the consumer is resilient and the business is doing well. On China, I'll begin. I'm sure Jon has incremental perspective, but the China opportunity remains intact. If you look at the underlying market size, if you look at the potential development of the middle class, if you look at the ability to drive category penetration in our categories, all of those are huge opportunities for us, and all of those point to continued investment and commitment to the Chinese market. We have a very capable organization, and we continue to be very optimistic that we can create value. Honestly, when the market requires market growth to be driven by manufacturers, I think that positions us very well with our retail partners in China to have a competitive advantage and execute the model that we know how to execute in many parts of the world. In the short term, we mentioned it in the script, consumer sentiment is not fully recovered yet, and that is reflected in the results. Again, if you want to take a silver lining, we see the attractiveness of key opinion leaders and heavy discounting in key consumption periods decreasing. And that's actually good for us. And we believe that a focus on brand equity, a focus on strong everyday value via the priority, will allow us to help grow the market back to mid-single digits and strengthen our position in the market. Last point on SK-II, no specifics. The numbers we're quoting, obviously on the quarter, minus 34% include the domestic travel retail channel. Nothing else to add there other than we remain confident that as the sentiment improves, which we see already, with continued investment in SK-II, we see that business recovering over the back half. Jon Moeller : Robert, as Andre suggested, I'll just provide a little bit of additional color on China. Having spent a fair amount of my career involved in that market and having just spent almost a full week there, in digesting the Q2 numbers, the P&G numbers in China, you have to think about a couple things. One is SK-II, which, just for clarity for everybody, is really driven by an anti-Japanese brand sentiment which Andre described. Our opening remarks that's related to the release of wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear facility, and we've had not identical but similar consumer sentiment dynamics in the past as relates to this brand and as relates to the relationship between those two countries. And it has always resolved itself with SK-II moving to higher heights. So, if you look at the decline in China on the quarter, on our business, I don't know the exact number, but basically think of it as 50% of that being the dynamic I just described and 50% of it being the market dynamics. The second thing that Andre referred to is important to understand as well. The heaviest purchase period historically in China was in November. I'm talking years past. And that was always a little bit disconcerting for us because a disproportionate amount of product moved during Double Eleven. It filled consumer pantries. It filled some retailer pantries, inventories and warehouses. It often moved at heavily discounted prices. The amount of movement during that period this year was much lower. And as Andre said, we view that as a good thing. And it's a temporary impact, a quarterly impact, a Q2 impact on the indices, but it moves us into a healthier position. If you think about the medium to longer term, Andre mentioned the expected addition of 200 million middle income consumers to China's population, that's very encouraging. Also, I mentioned I was in homes, I was in stores, I was with our retail partners. They remain encouraged about the future of China. I was talking to our organization at the end of the trip, our organization in China, and I told them I had never seen as much alignment in the market between our intentions and our strategy, our retailers intention and their strategy and the government's intention and their strategy, all focused on what's being referred to as quality market growth. As Andre suggested, that's a very good thing for us. We can play very effectively and help with that agenda, help society on a parallel path. And so, you put all that together, and I agree with Andre, and I said it earlier, I think the growth potential here remains intact. There are some specific items that exacerbate the trend that you're seeing on the quarter, but I expect this will continue to be a source of both growth and value creation for P&G. Sorry for the long answer, but I think it's important. Operator : The next question comes from Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Steve Powers : Thanks, and good morning. At the risk of provoking another long answer, I guess what struck me this morning is just the confidence and front footedness, if that's a word, in both of your comments this morning, and I think, Jon, your strategic perspective struck me as particularly assertive. I say that in the context on the outside, I think faced with some of the market challenges, you've called out China, the Middle east, etc., this quarter, concerns grow that P&G is likely to be thrown off course or maybe getting complacent. And I guess my question is, why is that wrong? And what to you are the keys to keeping the organization's eye on the ball, focused, grounded and executing on all those strategic pillars that you went through. Jon Moeller : Thanks, Steve. I want to step back first. We do face a lot of challenges in the world that we all live in, and those have impacted our business. But stepping back probably five years, the level of challenge has always existed, whether it was COVID, whether it was the highest consumer inflation in 40 years, whether it was the 50% reduction, 50 in our profit over two years as a result of commodities, foreign exchange, and transportation costs, and this organization overcame all of that. They've overcome the challenges we faced in the last quarter, and that gives me a huge amount of confidence that we have the ability, the skills, the strategy and the agility to continue to meet challenges, face first, and work through them in ways that are constructive for consumers, for customers, for employees, for society, and for share owners. We talk a lot internally about the complacency and the evils associated with it. So, it's front and center in our thought process. I have a couple of kind of trite sayings that I use in communicating with the organization, and one of them is that complacency kills. You don't see a complacent organization when you're looking at the breadth of growth that they're delivering. When you're looking at the continued, after a decade, continued work on productivity, yielding the kind of margin progress that we saw this quarter, you don't see it as they reinvest that into growing markets and to growing household penetration and shares. We're not immune to it, so you're right to raise it. But I feel, as you said, I feel the organization, not just myself, are very much on their front foot as they move to take advantage of the opportunities that we see in front of us. I've frankly never seen as many opportunities. Now, there's a lot of work associated with capitalizing on those opportunities, and there will be lots of challenges and forces that will be working against us in that endeavor. But the accomplishments of the midterm past, the most recent past, the reflection of the work that the organization is doing all the way down the income statement and the innovation progress that I'm seeing not only in market or coming to market, but as we review the pipelines across each of the categories also give me a good degree of confidence. Operator : The next question comes from Filippo Falorni of Citi. Please go ahead. Filippo Falorni : Hi, good morning, everyone. Jon, I wanted to go back to China. You mentioned clearly that there was an impact from the cycling of the eleven-eleven shipments. And can you give us some sense, like how down was China and SK-II during that period, and maybe some of the axial rate coming out of December that gives you some confidence in the improvement in the country in the second half. Thank you. Jon Moeller : I apologize. I honestly don't operate at that level of data aggregation. So, I don't have the answer with any degree of specificity, but I know the impact was there. I know it's a good thing for us long term, and apologize, but I'm just going to leave it there. Operator : The next question comes from Chris Carey of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Chris Carey : Hi, good morning. The U.S. volume growth improvement is very constructive. It's quite a bit better than what we can see in the U.S. Nielsen data, for example. I know the data is far from perfect, but I wonder if you could just help characterize whether you have any non-track channel boosts or in general talk about some of the specifics of what has really driven this volume improvement over the past five quarters. And I think maybe just connected to that if you could. There's a lot of debate right now across consumer staples around just what does drive volume improvement, whether that's promotional activity or increased advertising or just the lapping of pricing. And I find it interesting today that this dynamic of sequential volume growth, and I wonder if you can just maybe talk about in general why this seems to be happening, what you're doing to drive this, or whether this is just the natural evolution of markets post substantial pricing. So, thanks so much for that. Andre Schulten : Yes. Hi Chris, let me start. On the non-covered channel side, we've seen non-covered outpace cover channels for a period of time. This is not different. There's nothing specific happening there. We see a trend of some consumers going into larger pack sizes. Those are in club, those are online, and many of those effects continue. But there's nothing differential between covered and non-covered channels. Both are performing well. Non-covered a little bit ahead of covered, so that's why you don't see the results in the track data. What's driving the growth? I would argue it's all of the above that you've mentioned, right. I think, we're seeing pricing lapping, consumers seeing the pricing normalizing on the shelf. We don't see an increase in promotion depth or frequency, quite frankly. We are still operating at about 85% of pre-COVID levels from a volume sold on deal perspective. Competition is in a similar range, so there's no escalation of promotion. But what drives it, is strong innovation, innovation that is focused on growing the market, and strong communication of that innovation in a very targeted way, leveraging our capability, to be very detailed and very intentional on who we talk to, at what point in time, with what messaging. The U.S. is probably our most sophisticated market in that regard, and it shows in the ROIs and in the results - back to Lauren's question earlier. A few examples. Just the Gillette business, innovation on the core with the Labs razor provides a growth driver. But adding new jobs to be done, like female facial hair removal or male and female body hair removal, incremental jobs that when communicated appropriately of the benefit of the product drive incremental consumption. I mentioned Oral-B, penetration still low on the electric toothbrush. And as we're converting more and more users, that drives incremental growth with more innovation, but also expansion of the lower-priced options of Oral-B i03, 4, and 5, and then the launch of Oral-B 10. Last example, I'll give you and then I'll let Jon add is Olay Super Serum. Just to cover a few of the categories here is a new serum. The most successful new serum in the category, 30% of those users are new to the category. So again, communication, strong innovation, premium propositions, and bringing new crews to the categories, is what's driving that accelerated volume growth. Jon Moeller : And I'll just pile on. I agree with everything that Andre said. So just a couple more examples to show you again the breadth of the innovation that's been commercialized currently. He talked about Olay very exciting innovation in our hair care business as well. An example, Head & Shoulders BARE, which is a more efficacious anti-dandruff offering with the Bare minimum number of ingredients, nine to be exact. In an eco-friendly package, 45% less plastic. And it's one of the drivers of growth, particularly in North America on the Head & Shoulders brand which is up 8% fiscal year-to-date. Another example in a different category, Swiffer PowerMop, which is driving that business up 11% fiscal year-to-date and has built both volume and value of share at about 1.5 level so that's... And back to Steve's question on complacency, this is what we need to keep doing and that's why we talk about the best path forward being doubling down on exactly these things. They do drive market, they do drive volume, they do drive sales and they do it profitably. Operator : The next question comes from Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you. Good morning. So I wanted to go back to that 4% volume growth commentary in the U.S. and 3% in the EU focus markets. And despite the tough comparison for the cold and flu season, it seems that you had market share gains in laundry and some other key categories. So can you comment on how you exited the quarter, for the cold and flu season in the U.S. and in Europe? And separately, have you - it seems that you secured more distribution in the balance of this fiscal year. So any comment on that? And a clarification on China, you said that you're confident that the growth will resume to the mid-single-digit level. I'm assuming that's not a comment for this fiscal year. But as you commented out, Jon, in terms of like the Head & Shoulder and I know hair care is a big category there and you're comping easy comps in hair. So I was wondering if you can elaborate a little bit more than SK-II in particular? Thank you. Jon Moeller : Let me just take China real quick and then turn it over to Andre. On the cough, cold trend, et cetera. The mid-single-digit number that we referred to, is an expectation of longer-term market growth. You're correct. It is not an expectation of ours for either the market or our business in this current fiscal year. On the broader beauty question, when you take SK-II and the market impacts in China out of the equation. You see a business that's performing extraordinarily well. I mentioned Head & Shoulders, which is the largest shampoo brand in the world up 8% fiscal year-to-date. If you look at North America, Pantene fiscal year-to-date up 15%. Our skin and personal care business up double-digits. The same is true for the beauty business in Enterprise LA and in Europe. So it's a very strong business benefiting from the exact same strategies obviously applied differently that we're executing across the balance of the company. And that will, over time, as the market corrects itself, be demonstrated in China as well. Andre Schulten : So on the other two questions on PHC, Andrea look the business is obviously very, very strong past for your average growth rate of 13%. So, the underlying strength of the business is very healthy. We see an impact of the core cost season. The season is still above average, but it's below a record season last year and it's developing a little bit slower in the current profile, which means there could be some upside coming - as time goes by. Last year Vicks was 28% in the same quarter, so you can see the high base that we mentioned in the prepared remarks. Jon Moeller : Just one thing on that, sorry to interrupt, Andre - that I think is relatively straightforward, but it's worth mentioning. As we were all coming out of COVID going through our first cough our - first non-COVID or like COVID, cough cold season, it's not surprising having, but spent time in our homes for the last two to three years that the level of immunity was not high and therefore the level of incidence was very high. So that's what we're annualizing against combined with a slower start to the normal season. As Andre says, we'll wait to see how that all materializes. We have seen some increase in incidence. You can probably hear a little bit of a frog in my voice this morning and I heard one in Andre's. Andre Schulten : Right, we're contributing. There we go. Just last point on PHC, if you look at the share development in every treatment area that we cover in PHC, we're up in share. In every treatment area, we're up in organic sales across regions. So again, it's purely a seasonal element. On distribution, Andrea, I won't give you an answer other than obviously driving innovation, driving incremental sales for our retail partners, driving category growth helps with their desire to have our brands present on their shelves. Operator : The next question comes from Peter Grom of UBS. Please go ahead. Peter Grom : Thanks, operator, and good morning, everyone. So, I know you maintained your commodity outlook this morning, but just given the first half performance, the outlook does not embed as much of a tailwind from here, which you alluded to Andre, but can you maybe just unpack what you're seeing across your key cost buckets? Where are things getting better? Where are things getting worse? And maybe just based on current spot rates, how should we think about the phasing? Would you expect deflation in both 3Q and 4Q, or is there any potential for cost to become a headwind as we exit the year? Thanks. Andre Schulten : Hi, Peter. The commodity basket is wide, complex, and changing very quickly. So the best guess we have is what we told you, $800 million of tailwind for the year, which the majority of which has been flown through the P&L in the front half. What I'll leave you with, I don't expect any headwind from commodity in the second half. It continues to be a tailwind. The second thought I'll leave you with, is the impact on the P&L given the time it takes for commodity changes to flow through our contract structures and our own variance holding policy, make the time lag significant. So, even if we saw significant volatility on commodity spot prices, the impact on the fiscal will decrease over time simply, because of those two dynamics. But continue to expect tailwinds just less than you saw in half one. Operator : The next question comes from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jason English : Hi, good morning, folks. Thanks for slotting me in and yes belated Happy New Year to you all. A couple questions. We've talked a few times about the North America volume strength. I had in my notes that you're lapping some under-shipment that should have been a couple-point benefit to this quarter, yet I don't think you've mentioned it so far. So, A) am I wrong was there not a sizable benefit this quarter? And then it's encouraging to hear the confidence that you're expressing around - sort of sounds like an imminent improvement in SK-II, with words like recovery and improvement throughout the back half. With the decline sort of half related to Japan boycotts and half related to market conditions, where are you seeing the improvement? Is that dissipating concerns around Japanese brands, or are you actually seeing improvement in market conditions? Thank you. Andre Schulten : So the volume - we don't see a transitory effect on the volume side Jason, good morning first of all. So the base, there is always some base volatility if you know in terms of inventories, in terms of our ability to ship, but there is no material impact that I would call out that would have to be taken into account, if you look at the U.S. volume results. So nothing there. The SK-II improvement again, I want to pace expectations, but the improvement is really in the consumer sentiment that we're seeing, where we had very high social media coverage in quarter one, leading to negative sentiment and negative top-of-mind awareness of the brand, that is now dying down and honestly most consumers have gone back, to a neutral position, open to SK-II. And so, what we're doing is really doubling down with innovation and doubling down with communication on the efficacy, the quality of the product, the quality of the brand and leveraging the most loyal and passionate consumer group to help us make the case for SK-II, which we believe will help us improve run rates in the second half. The market dynamics, we continue to see bumpy, even over the next quarters improving, but there will be volatility there. Jon Moeller : It's just an end of one, Jason. So it's kind of irrelevant. But I was in the home of a heavy SK-II user in Beijing. And I asked her about this dynamic and how it was affected in her purchasing. And she kind of laughed, and it wasn't the normal nervous laugh. It was - and she said she followed that up with, if Japanese consumers aren't afraid of this, why should I be. And she said, I'm much more afraid of the pimple that I will get, if I don't use this than I am about. So it's starting to normalize again, that's and of one. It was also interesting to me to see, what was happening with her kind of personal inventory and just looking at the liquid fill levels in the bottles, which were low. So I think, there's a dynamic as well, where a number of consumers just kind of waited to see how this whole thing played out, and reduce their personal stocks in the process. But again, that's probably neither here nor there, but I thought it was worth sharing. Operator : The next question comes from Callum Elliott of Bernstein. Please go ahead. Callum Elliott : Hi, good morning. My question guys is, about your end market restructuring, which I think in the release you described as substantial liquidation of the affected markets in places like Argentina and Nigeria. And I guess look, recognizing these are not huge markets for you today. From a profit perspective, this still feels like fairly extreme decision and clearly, a challenging macro backdrop today in those markets. But in the case of Nigeria, probably one of the highest long-term potential economic market. So my question is, Jon I know these enterprise markets for your baby, so to speak, for a number of years. Just hoping you can walk us through what I imagine must have been a difficult strategic decision. Jon Moeller : Yes, these decisions are not taken lightly. A couple of points. One is where we're moving to an import model, which will be the case in Nigeria. We maintain an option on the future of those brands in those markets. We're just choosing to operate in a way that's - that frankly is viable. You get into some tough situations in some of these markets with currency controls with pricing controls with the ability to dividend money out of these markets. And at some point, you run into a set of conditions that just make it impossible operate. You can't get - you can't source dollars as an example, in order to purchase the ingredients and raw materials, you need to manufacture your products. And so, we've come to a decision when those situations present themselves to be pragmatic to be value creative and to flow resources to bigger opportunities that present more near-term opportunity, while in some cases, maintaining our optionality on the long-term. Andre, I don't know if you want to add anything to that. Andre Schulten : Yes, I just want to clarify, because the strategic intent really is what Jon described, right? We are moving in Nigeria to an import market, we will still be present, but it's a better way to serve the consumer and a better way for us to create value. In Argentina, we are divesting our fabric and home care business, and again, are looking to find a better go-to-market model. The language you're quoting Callum is substantial liquidation, that's an accounting term. And that accounting term, is really defining the point at which we recognize the accumulated foreign exchange translation loss in those markets, which is part of that noncash restructuring that we talked about. So the accounting term doesn't represent the business execution. It is a technical term that once we get to that point of substantial liquidation, we will recognize the accumulated foreign exchange translation loss. Jon Moeller : By the way, as a prior CFO would have had no hope of explaining that to you as Andre Schulten is the current CFO just did. Andre Schulten : I won't comment. Operator : The next question comes from Olivia Tong of Raymond James. Please go ahead. Olivia Tong : Great, thanks. Good morning. Clearly, you've generated some impressive growth in the U.S. and Europe, so I want to bring it back to the developed markets. And you've held on very nicely the price. So I wanted to ask you about competitive response and any pushback from retailers or increase in promotion from competition, given the share gains you've made and whether you're seeing any response there? Thanks. Jon Moeller : You want to talk competitive promotion, Andre, and then I'll talk to customers. Andre Schulten : Happy to. Hi, Olivia, so I started to mention this in the U.S. Our promotion level is still below pre-COVID about an 85 index competitive promotion level around 90 index. So very similar. We don't see a substantial increase in either depth or frequency in U.S. In Europe, we do see an increase in frequency, we do not see any increase in depth. Actually, both frequency and depth are still below pre-COVID levels, but frequency is increasing. So competitive environment still stable. And I think it's also driven by the fact that we are driving growth. We are driving market growth, and that contributes to the share growth, which means we can grow, but also it doesn't drive necessarily negative cycles in terms of pricing in the market. Jon Moeller : The whole idea, just building on Andre's last point there, is to create business not take business. And that works out well for us. It works out well for the categories that we compete in and it works out well for our retail partners. And that is really the focus of the existing interchange with our retail partners. It was number one, two and three supply as we've solidified our supply chains. The conversation moves very quickly to how do we work together to grow markets. That's a win-win-win proposition, a win for them, a win for us, a win for consumers. And of course, adding a fourth win for shareowners. So that's the state of play. And I experienced that in Europe, I experienced - I was in Europe as before Christmas. As you know, I was just in China, that was the nature of the conversation there, and it's clearly the nature of the conversation here in the U.S. Operator : The next question comes from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Please go ahead. Mark Astrachan : Thanks, and good morning, everybody. I wanted to go back to China for a brief time, I guess, on this call. The last quarter, you guys had talked about a portfolio structure examination. I guess I'm curious whether there's - any update on that, or what even does that mean? And maybe specifically, any underlying changes in consumer attitude towards beauty as a category including what is perceived to be relevant by brand, or efficacy. And also sort of related to that, it just seems a bit more of a fickle category more trendy category than some of the others that you were in? And I guess I'm specifically talking in China as opposed to globally, so you could sort of parse out that, I guess, if you want. But any thoughts on maintaining a presence in a category that has more subjective sort of usage than some of your other categories on everyday usage? Thanks. Jon Moeller : I'd offer a couple thoughts there. One, China is our second largest market, sales and profits. Beauty represents a significantly disproportionate amount of the business. So, if we weren't committed to the beauty business in China, you'd have to ask yourself a different question. Second, when we did our significant portfolio restructuring, however many years ago, that was now into daily use categories where performance drives brand choice, we did the same with beauty. Exiting the most fickle to use your semantics portions of the business. We exited what I call fashion fragrances and flavors. The brands that we have remaining and the categories that we play in, there's real opportunity to drive long-term loyalty with superior performance. That's true in China, that's true outside of China. And there will always be a higher trial rate in that category than in many other categories. That's not a bad thing. It helps demonstrate the superiority of what we do offer and people come back to our brands. So now - if the question is commitment to beauty in China, the answer is yes. Operator : Our final question will come from Edward Lewis of Redburn Atlantic. Please go ahead. Edward Lewis : Yes, thanks very much. We've been accustomed to strong performance in the U.S. for a number of years, but notable to see the strong performance in Europe again, with volume and price. I guess that comes at a time when you spent your scrutiny over here on pricing levels. So can you talk more about - what's behind the strong results for Europe at present? Andre Schulten : Look, I think the execution of the strategy in Europe is really behind the strength of the results. The team has done a fantastic job in combining the price increases that needed to be taken to recover the commodity cost increases with very strong innovation that delights the consumer at the time when they see higher pricing materialize on the shelf. And that's really behind the benign volume impact as we took the pricing and behind the acceleration of volume growth now that pricing is established in the market. We've done that. A few examples. Jon mentioned Ariel, I mentioned Ariel as well, but Ariel parts in a more sustainable packaging launched with the price increase that we needed to take has been building organic sales by up to 20% or higher. So the results are really a combination of strong innovation, pricing and therefore, maintaining consumers coming into the franchise and trading up not different from the U.S. Jon Moeller : We convinced ourselves for years that what mattered most in Europe was price, specifically the lower the better. And that wasn't an uninformed decision. You had the highest development of heavy discounters, for example, in Europe, which would then indicate that price is an important part of the consumer value proposition. But as Andre said, in the last number of years, we've really pushed innovation as a driver of value, not forgetting about value, but delivering it through performance. And that, combined with the executional capability of that market, which has just been phenomenal. And I want to thank them all as long as you've given me the opportunity to do that, has led to just really terrific results and I believe sustainable results. Great. Thank you for your time this morning. I know it's a little bit of a difficult quarter to unpack. There's a lot going on. The net of that, although is very positive, strong really strong earnings per share growth while increasing investments in the business, both present future maintaining top line momentum, building volume momentum and building share. As I expressed before, I have a high degree of confidence in our ability to achieve a level of success going forward, and that's based entirely on both the strategy and the ability of our organization to deliver against that. Look forward to seeing many of you at CAGNY in a month or so, and we'll advance the conversation at that point. We're around John Chevalier sitting across the table from me right now. He's around all day. Andre is around. They'll get angry if you call me, so call them, but have a great day. Thanks. Operator : That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

This discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections. As required by Regulation G, The Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. The Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business trends and has posted on its Investor Relations website www.pginvestor.com a full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Now, I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer, Andre Schulten. Andre Schulten : Good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today is John Chevalier, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Execution of our integrated strategy drove solid sales and market share results and another quarter of strong earnings and cash results. The strong results we've delivered in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 enable us to raise our outlook for core earnings per share and keep us on track to deliver within our fiscal year guidance ranges for organic sales growth, cash productivity, and cash return to shareowners. Specifically on the numbers, organic sales grew 3%. Volume was in line with prior year, showing sequential progress. Pricing contributed 3 points to sales growth as we continue to annualize price increases taken last fiscal year. Mix was neutral to organic sales growth, and growth across categories continues to be broad based with 8 of 10 product categories holding or growing organic sales in this quarter. Grooming organic sales grew double-digits. Home Care and Hair Care up high singles. Oral Care grew mid-single-digits. Fabric Care, Family Care, Feminine Care and Personal Health Care were up low singles. Skin and Personal Care and Baby Care organic sales were lower versus prior year. Growth was also broad based across geographies. North America, Europe and Asia Pacific focused markets and Latin America and Europe Enterprise markets are each growing organic sales. Global aggregate value share was up versus prior year with 29 of our top 50 category country combinations holding or growing share. Focus markets grew organic sales 2% for the quarter, and Enterprise Markets grew 4%. Organic sales in North America grew 3% with 3 points of volume growth. Over the last 4 quarters, volume growth in North America has been plus 2%, plus 3%, plus 4%, and now plus 3%. These results include over a point of impact from retail inventory reductions, primarily in personal healthcare. Consumer demand for P&G brands remains very strong in the U.S., with all outlet consumption value growth of 5%, all outlet value share was up 10 basis points versus prior year. U.S. volume share was up 40 basis points, reflecting continued strong volume growth ahead of the underlying market. The gap between consumer offtake of 5% compared to our U.S. sales growth of 3% reflects the aforementioned trade inventory reductions in the quarter. Europe focus markets were up 7% with 4 points of volume growth. Value share in Europe Focus markets was up 100 basis points over the past 3 months. Latin America organic sales were up 17%. Argentina is a significant contributor to this result given the pricing taken to offset the more than 400% devaluation of the Argentine peso since the start of the year. Mexico and Brazil are annualizing high base periods with organic sales growth in the 20s and 30s, and we expect will normalize back to pre-COVID levels in the mid to high single-digits. As we noted last quarter, there are some specific issues affecting other markets. Those challenges continue to impact results in the quarter. Greater China organic sales were down 10% versus prior year, progress versus the December quarter, but still impacted by weak underlying market conditions and headwinds for SK-II and other Japanese brands in the market. SK-II sales in Greater China were down around 30% for the quarter. We have seen some month to month improvement in overall Greater China sales trends, though we expect it will be another quarter or two until we return to growth. Volume trends in some of the European Enterprise and Asia Pacific, Middle East Africa countries such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Indonesia and Malaysia have remained soft since the start of the heightened tensions in the Middle East. Also, shipments in Russia continue to decline, double digits given our reduced footprint and curtailed investments with consumers and retailers. Combined, the headwinds from Greater China and Asia, Middle East Africa markets were a 150 basis point impact on total company sales for the quarter. We expect these headwinds to moderate or annualize over the coming periods. Moving to the bottom line, core earnings per share were $1.52 up 11% versus prior year. On a currency neutral basis, core EPS increased 18%. Core gross margin increased 310 basis points and operating margin increased 90 basis points. Strong productivity improvement of 320 basis points enabled continued strong investment in superior products, packaging and consumer communication to drive market growth. Currency neutral core operating margin increased 220 basis points. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 87%. We returned $3.3 billion of cash to share owners, approximately $2.3 billion in dividends and $1 billion in share repurchase. Over 3 quarters, more than $10 billion returned to shareowners in dividends and repurchases. Last week, we announced a 7% increase in our dividend, again reinforcing our commitment to return cash to share owners. This is the 68th consecutive annual dividend increase and 134th consecutive year P&G has paid a dividend. In summary, again, what continues to be a challenging and volatile operating environment, strong overall results enabling us to increase our earnings projections for the year and to maintain our guidance ranges for organic sales and cash generation, all while sustaining strong investment. It's a priority to build category consumption and to restore business growth in China and in the Middle East. Our teams continue to operate with excellence, executing the integrated strategy that has enabled strong results over the past 5 years, and that is the foundation for balanced growth and value creation. A portfolio of daily use products, many providing cleaning, health and hygiene benefits in categories where performance plays a significant role in brand choice. Ongoing commitment to and investment in irresistible superiority across the 5 vectors of products, package, brand communication, retail execution and value for each price tier where we compete. We are again raising the bar on our superiority standards to reflect the dynamic nature of this strategy. Productivity improvements in all areas of our operations to fund investments in superiority, offset cost and currency challenges, expand margins and deliver strong cash generation. An approach of constructive disruption, a willingness to change, adapt and create new trends and technologies that will shape our industry for the future. Finally, an organization that is empowered, agile and accountable. We continue to improve the execution of the integrated strategy with 4 focus areas : strong progress on Supply Chain 3.0, digital acumen, environmental sustainability and a superior employee value equation. These four focus areas are not new or separate strategies. They simply strengthen our ability to execute the strategy. Our strategic choices on portfolio, superiority, productivity, constructive disruption and organization reinforce and build on each other. When executed well, they grow markets, which in turn grow share, sales and profit. We continue to believe that the best path forward to deliver sustainable top and bottom-line growth is to double down on this integrated strategy, starting with a commitment to deliver irresistibly superior propositions to consumers and retail partners, fueled by productivity. Moving on to guidance. As I mentioned, we expect the environment around us to continue to be volatile and challenging, from input costs to currencies to consumer, retailer and geopolitical dynamics. However, our strong results year to date enable us to raise or maintain key guidance metrics for the year. We're maintaining our guidance range for organic sales growth of 4% to 5% for the fiscal year. We're squarely in the middle of this range fiscal year-to-date. This outlook assumes continued normalization in underlying market growth rates that we've seen over the past few quarters. Markets will be lapping the last waves of cost recovery pricing and volumes slowly begin to recover. We also expect the market level changes we faced through quarter 3 to continue in Q4 though with some directional improvement. On the bottom-line, enabled by 15% core EPS growth year-to-date, we are raising our outlook for fiscal 2024 core earnings per share from a range 8% to 9% to a range of 10% to 11%. This outlook includes continued strong investments in innovation and brand building to grow markets and extend the superiority of P&G offerings to consumers. We now estimate commodities will be a tailwind of around $900 million after tax in fiscal '24 based on current spot prices. This is a modest improvement versus the outlook we provided last quarter, though nearly all of this benefit has been booked in the first three quarters of the year. We now expect foreign exchange to be a headwind of approximately $600 million after tax for the fiscal year. The change versus prior guidance reflects volatility in Argentina exchange rates, including a period of currency appreciation in quarter three and a revised devaluation outlook for quarter four. We also reflect a reduction in Argentina FX exposure due to the divestiture of our Argentina Fabric and Home Care business, which we completed in mid-March, and reduced assumptions for future volume and pricing given the current rate outlook and recent shipment trends. The net impact of these changes is a relatively modest help to the bottom line, which is reflected in our updated EPS outlook. We expect higher net interest expense of approximately $100 million after tax versus prior year. General inflation and higher wage and benefit costs are also earnings headwinds for the year. We expect adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90%, and we expect to pay more than $9 billion in dividends to repurchase $5 billion to $6 billion in common stock, combined a plan to return $14 billion to $15 billion of cash to share owners for the year. This outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates, significant additional currency weakness, commodity cost increases, geopolitical disruption or major production stoppages are not anticipated within these guidance ranges. Finally, we'll be closely watching the more volatile regions we mentioned earlier, including the health of the China market, and we'll be keeping a close watch on competitive dynamics to ensure P&G brands remain a superior value for consumers and for retailers. The entire P&G organization remains focused on excellent execution of our integrated, market constructive strategy, which has delivered strong results in a challenging operating and competitive environment. While we expect volatile consumer and macro dynamics to continue, we are confident the best path forward is to double down on this strategy, remain fully invested to drive irresistible superiority across every part of our portfolio and stay focused on delivering balanced top and bottom line growth and value creation for our shareowners. With that, we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Lauren Lieberman : Andre, I want to talk a little bit about market growth versus market share. So first off, if you could just I know you said volatile a few times, but just if you could give us a sense for sort of a high level expectation for global market growth over the next 12 months. And then digging in a little bit more specifically, you shared you offered comments on share performance, particularly in North America and also in Europe focus. But I was curious if you could talk maybe about market share trends or the degree you can tell in China. And maybe let's talk about it excluding SK-II because I think that's an issue unto itself. But just a sense of P&G's performance versus the China market overall. And since it's been lagging for quite a while, arguably, things that you guys are seeing, addressing, doing differently or considering doing differently to sift that trend? Andre Schulten : So let me start with overall consumption strength, because it really is and continues to be strong. The consumption trends in the markets are stable despite multiple headwinds, and P&G is growing consumer off take in terms of value share in 29 of our top 50 category country combinations. Globally, we are growing value share by 10 basis points, and the consumption trends are really strong across markets, with few exceptions, which we'll get into. U.S. consumption in quarter three was 5%, and P&G value share is up. So our consumption actually grew ahead of that, both in terms of value and in terms of volume, actually with volume share being up 40 basis points on all outlet in the most recent period. So continued strength in consumption trends in North America and continued strength in terms of P&G performance within that consumption. Europe focused markets consumption is in the range of 8% to 9%, also very strong, and we are growing by more than a share point within that market. Both volume growth very strong with 4 points in the quarter and 3 points of price mix. LA and Europe Enterprise markets are growing, and so the business from a consumption standpoint, which really for us is the most important metric, is in a good place. We continue to deal with very specific headwinds in quarter three that we've discussed already in quarter two, but they continue. There's a soft market consumption in China. We'll get more into that to the second part of your question. SK-II continues to be a headwind in the quarter, and we see some impact from tensions in the Middle East. When you sum it all up, that's about a 1.5 impact on the global top-line. And then we have the inventory reduction in North America, which is about a point on the global top-line as well. And if you put it together, two conclusions. One, the headwinds that we're calling out are temporary in nature. So first of all, the inventory reduction, which is a point on the top-line, we expect that to be a single event, not a continued phenomena to observe. It was mainly driven by Personal Healthcare, because the supply situation is stabilizing after a softer season, so retailers don't need to hold safety stock. And the headwinds in China on SK-II and in the Middle East will ease over time and eventually annualize over the coming quarters. That does not mean that we will ignore any of the headwinds. We are fully focused on accelerating growth in China on SK-II and driving sustainable growth in Asia and Middle East markets, but it explains that we can hold our organic sales growth guidance at 4% to 5%. We're very confident in that and fiscal year-to-date, as we mentioned in the script, we're right at that level. Last point on that topic, we remain fully invested, and the gross margin progress the team has made is actually enabling us to continue to double down on investments, drive market growth and drive our own consumption and share within that. Specifically on China to the second part of your question, Lauren, I think it's a good way to look at China excluding SK-II, as you suggest. We are making sequential progress. The share in the most recent read is flat, and our shipments or our organic sales in China are improving quarter-over-quarter. If we look at quarter two, our organic sales excluding SK-II in China were down 10%. In the most recent quarter, they were down 3%. So we're making progress. The market is not yet recovering, but we see the trajectory going in the right direction. We have pockets of strength. Baby Care, for example, in China has grown 11% in the current quarter, our appliance business growing 14%. We are making strong investments in our hair care business with a more streamlined portfolio, and we feel good about our ability to continue to drive market growth, be market constructive in China, and see the upside as we've articulated before on a longer term on participating in the Chinese market. Will it be a straight line to recovery? No. It probably takes a few more quarters before we turn back to growth, but we see the trend line improving. Operator : The next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Steve Powers : Andre, I think you mentioned that nearly all of the commodity benefits that you expected this year you've essentially fully benefited from through the third quarter. And we've seen year-to-date in the calendar year, you're obviously in oil, right, with some plant related costs. So I guess just some thoughts on that in terms of how that impacts your early planning for fiscal '25? And maybe sort of related to that, just your confidence and your view, visibility into the productivity pipeline. And can we expect and do you have confidence you can run at an accelerated cadence of productivity over the next 12 to 18 months as well based on that pipeline? Thank you. Andre Schulten : Good morning, Keith. Yes. So commodity benefits, as we've mentioned in the script and you correctly state, have been really impacting fiscal year-to-date results. Any remaining change and we see obviously the impact of oil running up a little bit and also other commodities like pulp, for example, where the supply situation is a little bit tighter are coming up. There will be some impact on the current fiscal year, but given flow through of contracts and various holding policies, I expect that to be limited. And we anticipated that within our updated guidance ranges. So no impact to the current fiscal year. Obviously, if spot prices hold, you correctly stated, it will have an impact on next year. But I do feel strongly about our ability, and I think we've proven it over the past 2 years, that with a combination of strong innovation, good reasonable pricing combined with that innovation and strong productivity, whatever comes our way, we'll be able to handle. On the productivity pipeline, I feel very good about where we are. We have now across all businesses a 3-year, what I would call, a productivity master plan, which is something that we invested a lot of energy and time on in each business to make sure that we generate enough ideas, even those that take longer to implement, specifically as we work with our retail partners and we work with our supply chains to really fundamentally improve the efficiency of some of our combined processes. We have great visibility over 3 years. The pipeline is sufficient to what we need it to be. So the part I feel really strong about is productivity. It's fully in our control, and I think the teams are doing a great job creating projects and creating visibility to a very strong pipeline over the coming years. Operator : The next question is from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Andrea Teixeira : Andre, I was hoping if you can elaborate a little bit more on the flat price mix in the U.S. in fiscal 3Q. If are you seeing any downside within your portfolio? Or is that self-inflicted as you offer, more IGM on the lower price points or anything about packing that we shouldn't be aware of and also related to that I saw you, you mentioned in your leaves about the price related volume declines in Baby Care. Is that mostly China? Is there anything you can elaborate? Or is that also the U.S? And I think to Steve's commentary about commodities and question about commodities, anything you can talk to us regarding the lag that we're going to see that coming through into fiscal '25? Andre Schulten : Look, the flat price mix contribution to organic sales growth in the U.S. is an outcome of simply annualizing the price increases that we had taken in previous periods. That was anticipated and it's consistent with what we're seeing in terms of the construction of the market growth across the U.S. The volume component is coming up, getting closer to about 2%, and the value component is coming down. Different players have priced at different points. So that's really the differential between market and us. There is no trade down of note that I that we can observe. Private label shares, value shares are actually very stable, 16.4% past 1 month and 16.4% past 12 months. So consumers are not trading down within the U.S. towards private label. And if anything, we continue to see when consumers trade into P&G, which they continue to do because both volume share up strongly in the U.S. and value share up. Once they trade into P&G propositions, they continue to trade up actually within those propositions, be it from liquid detergent to unit dose to power pods. So we continue to observe that. So no worries in terms of trade down. On Baby specifically, look, Baby is annualizing a very strong base period and obviously was heavily exposed to the commodity run up and therefore took pricing and in combination with productivity and strong innovation. The volume decline, I would say, is really differential by region. If you look at China, the business is growing very strongly. It's actually 11% growth in the quarter, share growth of more than a point in China, and that's with birth rates contracting. So the portfolio strength in China is remarkable. When I look at the U.S., the premium tier, so when you look at swaddlers, you look at cruisers and cruisers 360, those tiers we have been innovating in very strongly over the past 12, 15 months, and they are growing. They are growing share, and they are growing sales. Where we have an opportunity in the U.S. is on the mid-tier. On Luvs, for example, we have not been able to push the full innovation pipeline out for different reasons, and that's what the team really is focused on to reestablish superiority on those few businesses where we feel that we let value get a little bit out of sync with what the consumer needs. But the plans are there, so now it's a matter of execution. So I feel very good overall about the baby care business, strong innovation pipeline, and that I think will address the isolated superiority gaps that we might have. On commodities, it's very difficult to say when they would actually flow through. I think it's safe to say that there's at least 60 to 90 days of delay. Many of the commodities will take longer to flow through simply because of contract structures that use certain trigger points or holding periods. So I would say at least 60 to 90 days, for many of them probably longer. The only one that tends to flow through quickly is fuel diesel, obviously, because it's captured in transportation. Operator : The next question is from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : We just touched on pricing. Maybe we can switch to the volume side. Can you just talk about your level of visibility and perhaps a bit of magnitude that you're expecting in Q4 in terms of returning to volume growth going forward? Obviously, a flat result this quarter, but there were some items that depressed volume, they get better going forward in terms of U.S. inventory, SK-II weakness, etcetera. So just looking for some perspective going forward, particularly as pricing presumably continues to decelerate a bit. And also maybe you can just touch on given the heavy marketing this year, presumably with the SG&A increases, the level of payback and ROI you think you're getting on that higher marketing in terms of volume? Andre Schulten : On the volume side, look, I think the effects that we described that are holding us back in the current quarter, the inventory effect in the U.S. of 2 points, which is a point on a global basis, I don't expect that to hold. So I expect the U.S. to continue to grow in terms of volume beyond the 3% that we're seeing in the current quarter. I expect some of the negative headwinds in China, the Middle East and SK-II hopefully will improve sequentially. But in aggregate, I fully expect the markets to continue to recover, shift more towards volume growth as we've seen consistently over the recent periods. And since we're growing or holding volume share in most geographies that will also flow into our results. So sequential progress on volumes, many open questions still, but I expect the line to point upwards. On marketing spend, you're right. We continue to invest in reach frequency with strong quality of communication across the markets. We are very diligent in pre ROI analysis and very diligent in post event analysis to ensure that we understand whether the spending is effective. And if you look at the results, I would argue it is. The strongest combinations of great product innovation with a very sharp consumer insight translated into a great copy drives strong results. So if you look, for example, at our Skin and Personal Care business, Old Spice and Secret total body deodorant, great consumer insight, great product, great packaging, strong communication, and the business is growing 11% in North America. If you look at our home care portfolio, those are categories that are expandable. Swiffer PowerMop, for example, getting new users to use Febreze plug-ins, those marketing investments grow the market, and they grow our share within the market. So expandable categories is a big investment area for us. So we continue to drive high levels of discipline. We will not spend if there's no ROI. And you're right, we're watching the same and asking the same question to ensure that we remain on the right side of that line. Operator : The next question is from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Bryan Spillane : Maybe, Andre, just to pick up on that last point. I guess if we think about year-to-date and I guess as it translates to the full year in the base, we have some headwinds that shouldn't recur, right? The weakness in Corporate Chemicals, the destock that you just mentioned, SK-II, I guess being more negative than overall market in China for the reasons we know. So I guess as we kind of think about next year, right, and confidence in being able to be in line with long-term organic sales targets. Does the comps make it easier? Should we be thinking about the macro environment maybe not being supportive? Just try to put some context around the organic sales growth this quarter, which decelerated from the last quarter and just is there anything we should be thinking about as we move we start thinking about our models for next year? Andre Schulten : I would point first to the market growth expectation, which we said we expect markets to be in the range of 3% to 4% in terms of value growth. And that will be a combination of 2 points of volume and 1 to 2 points of price mix. That is still our assumption. Our role per our growth algorithm is to be growing slightly ahead of that by driving market growth, which in turn will drive share and a bigger part of us leading the market. So that would be my answer. On the current fiscal year, obviously, by reiterating guidance of 4% to 5% and being right in the middle of that range fiscal year-to-date. That means mathematically we expect quarter four to be in the 4% to 5% range. And if you project that out, I think with the market growth dynamic I was describing, I think that will give you a good starting point for next fiscal year. Operator : The next question is from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Bonnie Herzog : I just had a quick clarification on your guidance. You maintained your FY '24 organic sales growth of 4% to 5%, but that implies a step up of growth in Q4 to get to the high end of your range. So I guess I wanted to clarify if you still expect to be at the high end or should we assume coming in at maybe the midpoint of your top-line guide for the year is more realistic? And then maybe just a quick question on your SG&A expense, which did step up quite a bit during the quarter. So just maybe hoping for a little more color on the drivers of this. Andre Schulten : We did not reiterate the top end of the range, but we reiterated the range. And that means 5% is still possible. Is it probable? I don't know. Probably more 50-50 than it was before. So the range is valid. I wouldn't point today at the top end of the range. On the SG&A line, we continue to invest in marketing as we discussed in previous question, and we really saw an increase in our marketing spend of about 14% year-over-year. That's the main driver. It's offset by productivity on the SG&A line, but really I would point to continued investment, productive investments to drive market growth and push out our innovation and that's the main driver of the SG&A increase that you're seeing. Operator : The next question comes from Olivia Tong with Raymond James. Olivia Tong : My question is about mix, which flattened out this quarter after about a year and a half of improvement. So, clearly, you guys have been adamant that we're not seeing trade down. But, as you look at this, how much of that is trade up is just harder to do now? You've obviously done you've been very successful all of late with Powerwash and EZ-Squeeze and Paws, etcetera, etcetera. So is that becoming harder? And could you talk about mix expectations over perhaps the next 12 months? Andre Schulten : Yes. Thanks, Olivia. I don't think the fundamental dynamic in terms of consumers trading into the P&G portfolio and trading up is changing. We've not observed it over the past 2 years, and we've not seen it in the most recent period. There are some drivers and headwinds to mix. The biggest headwind I would mention is SK-II being down 30%. It's our highest value per or one of the highest value per unit items, and that obviously has a material impact on mix. Outside of that, we really don't see in any of the regions a significant down trading within our portfolio. As I mentioned, in the U.S., we continue to see trade up. Actually, the premium tiers on baby care doing better. I mentioned that in the context of Love. So we continue to think that the way that we innovate, providing value with innovation and showing the superiority of our premium items in the portfolio is resonating with consumers. And as long as we do that and as long as that value is real and tangible for consumers, I think we can hold on to that mix trend that we've seen consistently. Operator : The next question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Chris Carey : Just regarding the, just one quick follow-up on the organic sales range for the full year. The slight change and I know the range is still in scope. Can you just frame maybe how much of that was the inventory dynamics in the U.S., maybe a little bit less pricing in Argentina versus anything that has fundamentally developed through the quarter? And just connected to that, if you could, you mentioned the elasticity dynamics in Baby and Feminine Care in the press release. Can you just comment on what you're seeing from a broader perspective, specifically as you may need to contemplate some incremental pricing next year with the moves we're seeing on the cost side? Andre Schulten : Thanks, Chris. I think you gave the answer on the organic sales line. It's exactly that. I think Argentina, as we said, peso requires a little less pricing. That's an impact on organic sales, and the business is also smaller and responding maybe more aggressively to the pricing. So that is one building block. The other building block, I think is the biggest one is really the U.S. inventory reduction. So as I think about the step up that we need to see in order to be within that 4% to 5% range, we assume that that inventory reduction is a one timer, and that's what we expect in the guidance range. The elasticity in general is not changing. I think we've done and you see it in the results, I think the teams have done a very good job of making sure that we maintain a healthy value equation for our retail partners and our consumers with strong innovation, with pricing, only pricing where necessary, balancing pricing with strong productivity. So I do feel overall the business is responding very favorably even after we had to take the pricing that we took. The volume is coming up as we would have expected both in the market and for P&G. And in our biggest geographies, we're growing volume share consistently. So I do feel overall the elasticity is doing well. Baby is a very elastic category. And especially, as I mentioned, if we've not been able to consistently innovate across all tiers. And that actually is a confirmation of the model. So where we've not been able to push the innovation out and hold the full level of superiority as we took pricing, the consumer is responding. And we know the answer to that, which is push the innovation that we know how to do and communicate as a priority, and I'm confident that we'll recover the elasticity here. I don't see a broader issue. Actually, I see a lot of upside with the strength of the innovation pipeline going into next year. Operator : The next question comes from Callum Elliott with Bernstein. Callum Elliott : I wanted to come back please to Andrea's question on trade down. I think, Andre, you had pointed to the stable private label market share as a sign that there is no trade down. And I want to push back on that a bit. I think we all know that the consumers under the most pressure at the moment are the low income consumers, many of whom were probably already using private label products in the first place. And so my question is, is it not possible that volume reductions and cutbacks amongst the low income cohorts sort of who were already using private label a year ago are offsetting the trade down impacts and sort of masking that trade down in that flat market share number that you're talking about. And that could also explain why category growth has weakened so much. And I guess just to add to the question, I'm surprised that the private label market share is the metric that you're pointing to justify lack of trade down. And I'm just wondering, do you not track consumers longitudinally over time to measure trade down and what consumers are doing? And is private label market share really the best metric that we have to track this? Andre Schulten : Look, I'd be worried that the phenomena you're describing would be a driver if, A, the volume in the market wasn't growing, which it is, and if we weren't able to grow volume share, but only grow value share. So I don't think that's the case. We're growing volume share. The market is growing in terms of volume. And one of the hypotheses I would have for you is that a lot of our consumers are actually not switching with private label heavily at this point in time. On the metrics that we use, look, private label share is the most visible metric that we can point to and it's also visible to you. So it's one that is convenient to use and objectively verifiable. So that's why we're using it. Internally, obviously, we use a lot more detail. We track exact consumption by tier, by product form, by retail channel. We check our share versus competitive share at that level of detail. So there's a lot more internal discussion on do we see trade down within our portfolio, do we see trade down across our portfolio with competitors to lower tiers. But private label is just the most visible and robust measure that we can point to that is visible to you guys. Operator : The next question comes from Filippo Falorni with Citi. Filippo Falorni : I wanted to go back to the U.S. market. The 5% consumption level was pretty strong and we see in track channel data. Are you expecting from a reported standpoint to get closer to that level in Q4 as you don't have the negative impact from the inventory? Or what are the puts and takes in Q4? And then just specifically on laundry in the U.S., your largest category? There was some recalls in Tide PODS recently, so maybe you could talk about any potential impact from that in Q4. And then longer term, you announced the innovation on Tide EVO, so maybe some color on the rollout of that brand and the product and your expectations? Andre Schulten : Yes. Hi, Filippo. You're right. We hope U.S. market growth continues in the high 4s, low 5s, and I think the trend line is pointing in that direction. And unless we see any major inventory reduction, I would expect us to continue to trend in that same direction. We are driving market growth in most of our categories in the U.S., and that should mathematically then result in stable to increasing shares both on the volume and value side. And that's certainly the objective the team has on all the U.S. businesses. The laundry recall, it was a very limited recall on a packaging defect on 1 SKU on Tight PODS. Out of an abundance of caution, the team decided to recall the product. It's no impact or very limited impact actually on the quarter or the fiscal year. And again, that product itself is safe, so no issue with the product. It was a small packaging defect, but in any case, the team decided to go ahead and recall. We're very excited about the EVO innovation. The fiber spinning innovation has been one of our core developments, so seeing it in market is exciting, but it's very early. So we run these test markets to validate product market fit, validate the commercial execution, validate everything from packaging color to packaging sizes. And it'll take us a few months before we have anything of substance. But yes, the innovation is very exciting, but it will take time before it has an impact on overall laundry growth in the U.S. Operator : The next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI. Robert Ottenstein : Two follow ups. First, can you talk a little bit more about Europe, very strong market and your results have been extremely strong. So perhaps what's driving the strength of the market, your market share gains? And is this something that you think can flow through into 2025? And then second, kind of coming back on China, there's been significant channel shifts that we're noticing certainly in the beauty area. It's 50% to 60% online with TikTok being half of that. So kind of number 1, wondering to what extent you're adapting to that and are prepared to adapt to that shift? And then second, for the non-beauty business, do you also see the online business moving to TikTok as well? And maybe talk about your share online and off line in those categories, the main categories in China? Andre Schulten : Indeed, Europe results have been outstanding. Aggregate Europe between Europe focused markets and Europe enterprise markets, we now have, I think, 12 consecutive quarters of 5% or higher growth, which is outstanding. I think the strength of the business maybe let me focus on the focus markets here for a minute. The strength of the business has been consistent because of the execution of the team, strong innovation pushed out over an extended period of time as we were taking pricing, very strong productivity work in the region across every part of the P&L to limit the amount of pricing we needed to take but brilliant execution of the pricing that was taken, respecting key price points, respecting retailers and consumer constraints, and I think that's playing out. We've also invested very strongly probably more than ever in terms of marketing support of those innovations in the focus markets. And we are building the same digital capability in terms of consumer targeting to become more effective and efficient with our spend in Europe that we've used in the U.S. for an extended period of time. So all of those would be contributors to growth. On the enterprise market side, I would caution it's not without headwinds. Russia continues to be a headwind that we called out with a reduced portfolio and very little support of the business. We have work to do in Turkey as Turkey recovers from the heavy inflation based pricing and some of the Middle East outflow of tensions. So it's not without headwinds, but I think the underlying performance of the European business continues to be strong, and it's built the right way. You're correct on the channel shifting in China. Obviously, Douyin is a significant driver, most heavily probably in beauty. We've been talking about this before. What we want to make sure is we keep a healthy balance between building brand equity versus simply low funnel transactional execution via KOLs that only make sales via deep discounting, but don't do anything for the brand equity or for our superiority messaging. That's what we're doing. We're building brand houses on Douyin. We're making sure that we have a good balance between transactional communication and equity communication. We have innovation that is launching on Douyin First, Head and Shoulders Premium would be a good example of most recent innovations. So we're playing in the channel, but we're playing with a sense of value creation and balance between top-line growth and profitability. The channel is relevant for other parts of the business as well and the same principles apply. We are careful to ensure that we are balanced across top line and bottom-line, and we protect and grow underlying brand equity. Operator : The next question comes from Peter Grom with UBS. Peter Grom : Thanks, operator, and good morning, everyone, and hope you're doing well. Maybe one quick housekeeping. Can you maybe just help us understand how much of the stronger earnings guidance was related to the improvement in FX? Andre, I know the FX guidance became more favorable, but I think you also mentioned you're reducing your exposure due to divestiture Argentina. So I just want to make sure I understand the moving pieces as it relates to the FX impact on the earnings range. And then just a quick follow-up on SK-II in China, I think month to month improvement was mentioned. So just any color you can provide on the exit rate relative to the 30% decline in the quarter, I think would be pretty helpful. Andre Schulten : Okay. Good morning, Peter. Yes, the foreign exchange held was an interesting one because the $400 million reduction, as we said, was all related to Argentina. And we had assumed in the previous guidance that whatever exposure is generated in Argentina will have to be offset with pricing within the fiscal year in Argentina. So as the assumption changes and the business size reduces, the net outcome to the P&L is very limited. So yes, we saw a technical reduction because of the improving peso and the lower size or smaller size of the business. The net effect to the P&L will be very limited because of the underlying assumption we made from the very beginning that we would offset that impact of FX via pricing in the market. SK-II in China is, I think bottoming out in terms of the shipment pattern. As we said, we are about 30% down in the quarter. It's very encouraging to see some positive signs in terms of consumer sentiment as the team continues to innovate. The team drives very strong communication on the core benefit space of the SK-II proposition focusing on PITERA as a core ingredient and reason to believe. We are leveraging continue to leveraging the core consumer in China, very loyal to the brand, to amplify that messaging and it's starting to resonate. So we see positive signs. It will take time until that translates into shipments though. I think retailers are sitting on a little bit of stock, and I think they will be hesitant to order until they see good signs of consumption increases. So I would caution, I don't expect this to be a fast recovery. This will take some time. Maybe last point on SK-II. Outside of China, the business is doing very well. We're growing double digits in Japan, so I think the fundamental proposition is healthy. We just have to sort through this period in China. And again, we're pointing, I think, in the right direction, but it will take time. Operator : The next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Nik Modi : Just a few, kind of housekeeping items. Andre, just wanted to confirm that the destocking in the U.S. was isolated to the consumer health business. And then the other 2 questions I had, what the Tide EVO, the technology that you've developed, would that be applicable to other brands and, other cleaning solutions within the P&G portfolio? And then just the final thing is, I think there's a lot of the theme I'm hearing is broadly from speaking to investors along this call is the delta between obviously how P&G is performing and how the how everyone else is performing. And, you know, I think the competition that that you're dealing with, I think, generally are struggling, for volume growth. So as you think about guidance, you know, how much have you contemplated a step up in competitive spend? Right? I understand the fact that you guys have the momentum and you're gaining share and the innovation is working. But I just wanted to get an understanding of kind of how measured your guidance is in relation to potential competitive response. Andre Schulten : Destocking in the U.S. was broadly personal healthcare related. That was the biggest effect in, again, an okay season, but significantly weaker than last year and generally an industry wide recovery of the supply chain. So if you're a retailer, you no longer see the need to hold safety stock. You're convinced that when the season restarts and you need product, you can order and you get it. There was some of that also in the Tampax business, in the tampon business, as we have stabilized the supply chain there, similar dynamic. And there was a little bit of destocking in Hair Care, because we had up stocking in the base, but the majority of it, to keep it simple, is healthcare. Indeed, the EVO technology, so the fiber spinning technology, is a technology that can be applied in broader context. We've applied it to facial cleaning in beauty, and there are many other applications. This is one of our platform technologies, if you think about it. The ability to spin chemistry into a fiber and avoid water as a carrying agent has so many efficiencies and advantages in the chemistry that we can put together and obviously in the logistics and cost side that, yes, we would want to apply it. But step by step, we got to make sure the EVO's proposition works well, and that's why we're in test market, and we talked about this earlier. Competitive spending, if done the right way, would be a good thing. If we see competitors innovate, if we see competitors communicate in market constructive ways, drive incremental spend in marketing dollars, that's a good thing. So we hope to see that. On the promotion side, we don't really see a dynamic that would point to anyone escalating promotion. We see stable depth of promotion in Europe, a little bit of increase in frequency. In the U.S., we are operating at about 85% business sold on deal, which 85 index versus pre-COVID level, sorry, that's about 29% of business volume sold on deal. And we see competitors at similar ranges, so and it's stable over a period of time. So again, if we see market constructive spend, great. Nobody seems to have an interest in heavy promotion at this point in time. Operator : The next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with Jefferies. Kaumil Gajrawala : I guess as we get towards the end of the call, putting a lot of it together, lots of information on volume, on organic revenue, also why it should get better sequentially. I think putting that in the context of what your earnings have grown year-to-date versus the guidance of 10 to 11 implying almost a flat 4Q, I think that suggests a very significant step up in reinvestment or maybe in something else. So can you maybe just try to reconcile each of those pieces? Andre Schulten : Yes. Kaumil, the main driver here is the profile of some of the tailwinds and headwinds. I don't expect a major step up in spend quarter over quarter. I think we will sustain good investment levels. And again, as I said, we will be ROI driven, so it's up to the teams. But I don't expect a step up as the main explanation of why Q4 looks different in terms of EPS growth. The main driver is a lot of the commodity help has been booked in the front half of the year. And if anything, there's a little commodity herd coming in Q4. As we talked, oil potentially as reflected in diesel rates and maybe some of the pulp impact will hit this fiscal year. And then the foreign exchange rate, so forget about Argentina. I think we've discussed that. But the balance of the foreign exchange rate will mostly hit in the second half, and that's heavily in quarter four. And then the last element is just base period. So Q4 last year was very strong because of a different profile. This profile looks a little bit different for the reasons I explained. But don't expect a material change in spend behavior. It's really more of the macro drivers that impact the profile. Operator : The next question comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark Astrachan : One follow-up on SK-II. Last quarter, you talked about your research suggesting that brand sentiment was improving. I didn't hear that. I guess, is that still the case? You're still doing more work on what's going on, I guess, specific to what's happening in China? And then more broadly, reinvestment has just been considerable this year, obviously, because gross margin has expanded, at least in part because gross margin has expanded so much and allows you to do that. As you think about the setup from here, commodities unknown, but probably not as big of a tailwind, net, net and pricing clearly not as big of a tailwind as it's been. So as you go into next year and you presumably have a little less gross margin to play with, how do you think about what the reinvestment levels look like? And then what is the contribution? I mean, I know it's a squishy question, but how much contribution do you think you've had from 300 plus basis points of reinvestment back in the business to drive share, volume, value, etcetera? Thank you. Andre Schulten : Yes. Mark, on SK-II, I think the brand sentiment has been sequentially improving. The work the team is doing on innovation, on communication and credentialing, I think, is resonating with the consumer. And as the overall sentiment towards Japanese brands is improving, we are also getting a bit more bold in the breadth of the communication, the reach and frequency that we use. So I think all of that is pointing in the right direction. As I mentioned, I think the order behavior might lag, so we might see improvement in consumption before we see improvement in shipment. So that's why I was cautioning that while we see consumer sentiment improving, that first has to translate in increased consumption, and that then has to translate into increased orders and shipment, and that will take some time. So the team is doing the right work, and I'm glad they're actually doing it in a very balanced way to ensure that we're rebuilding this brand for the long-term. In terms of spending, I think this will really be done business by business, geography by geography, so it's hard to give you an answer. The only thing I'd point to is we are planning on significant productivity to continue in the marketing spend area. So that in and of itself would be somewhere between $400 million and $500 million of productivity in the space. That is always up for discussion. Do you reinvest or do you flow it through. And it will really depend on the level of innovation we are able to drive. More innovation means more spend and hopefully better return. And I'll leave it at that in terms of the ROI. I think I've answered the question before. It's there in the aggregate discipline of the categories, but I wouldn't want to go into more detail. I think it's really down to the category country combinations at which we measure it, and at which those decisions are made. Operator : Today's final question comes from Brett Cooper with Consumer Edge Research. Brett Cooper : And I wanted to follow on Nik's question. Over the last few quarters, some of your peers, your competitors have talked about elevating their rates of growth. You touched on this a bit before, but I was hoping you could talk about the opportunity or capacity for category growth rates to elevate further if more players are deploying strategy than you execute. And how do we see that come through with respect to volume or price or mix? And then just finally, if there's anything that you need to do with respect to elevating innovation more or do anything in light of what may be a more competitive environment on that front? Thank you. Andre Schulten : Look, I think if more of our competitors adopt a market constructive strategy and innovate and spend in that way, that's good for everyone. And if you look at the category development globally, there's still so much opportunity to grow even in the most developed markets to grow category penetration in places like fabric enhancers. So that is a big opportunity in many of the markets where we play. The category development index is index 30 or maybe slightly higher. So there's plenty of opportunity to be market constructive, so that's a good thing. We are constantly looking at our superiority and our innovation. That's inherent in the strategy of irresistible superiority. So we've talked about resetting the bar. We've done that with exactly that in mind, what will it take for us to continue to be market constructive, win consumers for the next 5 years instead of just looking back at the success we had over the past 5 years. So that is part of the growth model and part of how the organization operates. Andre Schulten : All right. Thank you for your time today. If you have additional questions, John, myself will be available during the day. Thank you for your time and thank you for your interest. Operator : This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning and welcome to Procter & Gamble\u2019s quarter end conference call. Today\u2019s event is being recorded for replay. This discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G\u2019s most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from these projections. As required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business trends and has posted on its Investor Relations website, www.pginvestor.com a full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Now I will turn the call over to P&G\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, Andre Schulten. Andre Schulten : Good morning everyone. Joining me on the call today are Jon Moeller, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, and John Chevalier, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. I will start with an overview of results for fiscal year \u201924 and for the fourth quarter. Jon will add perspective on our strategic focus areas and capabilities and will close with guidance for fiscal \u201925 and then take your questions. Fiscal \u201924 was another very strong year. Execution of our integrated strategies enabled the company to meet or exceed going-in guidance ranges for organic sales growth, core EPS growth, cash productivity and cash return to share owners, all this despite significant market level headwinds that were largely unknown when we gave our initial outlook for the year. Organic sales growth for the fiscal year was 4%, our sixth consecutive year of 4% or better organic growth against a strong 7% comp in the prior year and in more challenging market conditions. Growth was broad-based across business units with eight of 10 product categories growing organic sales. Home care, hair care and grooming were up high single digits, oral care and feminine care up mid singles. Fabric care, family care, and personal healthcare grew low single digits. Skin and personal care and baby care were down low singles. Focus markets grew 4% for the year with North America up 5% and Europe focus markets up 8%. Greater China organic sales were down 9% versus the prior year, driven by soft market conditions and brand-specific headwinds on SK-II. Enterprise markets were up 6%, led by Latin America with 15% organic sales growth. Ecommerce sales increased 9%, now representing 18% of the total company. Our strategy focused on driving market growth continues to drive share growth for P&G. All channel market value sales in the U.S. categories in which we compete grew around 5% in fiscal \u201924. P&G consumption grew ahead of our fair share of category growth, driving modest value and volume share growth for the year. We grew global aggregate value share. Thirty of 50 category country combinations held or grew share for the year. Importantly, this share growth is broad-based. Six of 10 product categories grew share globally over the past year. Core earnings per share were $6.59, up 12% for the year. Core gross margin improved 360 basis points and core operating margin increased 170 basis points. Over $2.3 billion of productivity improvements were enabled by a significant increase in investment in superior products, packages and brand communication to drive market growth. On a currency-neutral basis, core EPS was up 16% and core operating margin increased 250 basis points. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 105%. We increased our dividend by 7% and returned over $14 billion of value to share owners, $9.3 billion in dividends, and $5 billion in share repurchase. Moving onto fourth quarter results, organic sales rounded down to 2%, volume was up 2%, solid sequential progress. Pricing was up 1% and mix was in line with prior year. Growth continues to be broad-based across categories and regions. Nine of 10 product categories grew or held organic sales in the quarter. Home care, hair care, grooming and oral care were each up high single digits, feminine care up low singles, skin and personal care, fabric care, personal health care and family care were each in line with prior year, and baby care was down mid singles. Five of seven regions grew organic sales with focus markets up 2% and enterprise markets up 2% for the quarter. Organic sales in North America grew 4% with four points of volume growth and price mix, in line with prior year. European focus markets organic sales were up 2% against a strong 12% comp in the base period. Volume was up 3%. Price mix was down a point as the region has now fully annualized prior year inflation-driven pricing. Latin America organic sales were up 8%, including high singles growth in Brazil. Of note, Argentina\u2019s overall contribution to organic sales for the region and the company were lower than the last two quarters due to the divestiture of a portion of the business in March and a notable decline in shipment volume for the remaining categories. As was announced earlier this month, we have divested the remaining portions of our operations in Argentina. As a result, Argentina will be largely removed from our organic sales reporting in fiscal year \u201925. Select P&G brands will still be available in the market through a distribution and licensing agreement with the new owner of the operations. Greater China organic sales declined 8%. Underlying market conditions have remained weak and the 6/18 key consumption period was down sharply versus prior year, just as we saw in the 11/11 Chinese New Year and Valentine\u2019s Day shopping periods. Also, brand-specific headwinds have continued on SK-II due to its Japanese heritage. We expect general market trends and the dynamics related to SK-II to improve over time, though it will likely be another quarter or two until we return to growth. Volume trends in some Europe enterprise and Asia Pacific, Middle East, Africa countries such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Indonesia, Malaysia and Russia have remained soft. We expect these headwinds to moderate or annualize over the coming periods. Global aggregate market share was down 30 basis points as we are now annualizing very strong growth in European-focused markets. Twenty-five of our top 50 category country combinations held or grew share for the quarter. On the bottom line, core earnings per share were $1.40, up 2% versus the prior year. On a currency-neutral basis, core EPS increased 6%. Core gross margin increased 140 basis points and core operating margin decreased 100 basis points. Strong productivity improvements of 250 basis points, funding a meaningful increase in marketing investment, currency-neutral core operating margin decreased 60 basis points. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 148%. We returned nearly $4 billion of cash to share owners this quarter, over $2.4 billion in dividends, and $1.5 billion in share repurchases. In summary, we met or exceeded each of our going-in target ranges for the year : organic sales growth, core EPS growth, free cash productivity and cash returns to share owners, strong performance again this year in a challenging economic and geopolitical environment. With that, I\u2019ll pass it over to Jon. Jon Moeller : Thanks Andre. I\u2019ll start with a few thoughts on results before discussing the strategy. Our team continues to execute the strategy with excellence, enabling strong results over each of the past six years pre-COVID, during COVID, through a historic inflationary and a pricing cycle, and through geopolitical tensions. Organic sales growth of plus-5, plus-6, plus-6, plus-7, plus-7, and plus-4 over the last fiscal years. Strong earnings growth and growth in operating margin expansion. Very strong cash generation and over $96 billion of cash returned to share owners over those six years. For fiscal \u201924, going-in organic sales guidance was 4% to 5%. We delivered 4% in a very volatile environment. Flat volume for the year with improving trajectory through the year, 2% growth in the fourth quarter. Strong volume growth in North America and Europe focus markets offsetting soft markets in enterprise regions in China. Going-in core EPS guidance of 6% to 9%, delivered 12%. Core gross margin at a 17-year high with strong productivity improvement funding strong marketing investments. Going-in cash productivity outlook of 90%, delivered 105% which enabled a 7% dividend increase, the 68th consecutive year of increase and the 134th consecutive year paying a dividend. As Andre said, strong results in a challenging environment. To be very clear, there\u2019s still more work to do to continue improving areas in our control, which will be needed to offset the headwinds that are largely not in our control. We\u2019ll double down on superiority across all five vectors. We\u2019ll double down on productivity up and down the P&L and across the balance sheet. We\u2019ll double down on enabling our organization to execute our integrated strategy with excellence, to delight consumers and win in the marketplace, to deliver the level of balanced growth and value creation results you and we expect. Our strategy is dynamic and sustainable. It adapts to the changing needs of consumers, customers and society and is focused on growing markets, creating versus taking business, the most sustainable and typically most profitable way to grow. A focused portfolio of daily use products and categories where performance drives brand choice. The portfolio is performing, delivering broad-based growth across nearly all categories and most geographies. As you know, we are active managers of our portfolio. Over the last several years, we have made some targeted additions and subtractions in that portfolio. We have adjusted our operating model in several markets. Each of these moves were made with a focus on long term balanced growth and value creation. The second strategy element, ongoing commitment to and investment in irresistible superiority through innovation across the five vectors of product, package, brand communication, retail execution, and value holistically defined. Leveraging that superiority to delight consumers, grow markets and our share in them, to jointly create value with retail partners. The plans across the businesses are broader and stronger than any time in the recent past as each team works to increase their margin of superiority and consumer delight. Superior innovations that are driven by deep consumer insights, communicated to consumers with more effective and efficient marketing programs, executed in stores and online in conjunction with retailer strategies to grow categories and our brands and priced to deliver superior value across each price tier where we compete. We\u2019ve talked many times about the superiority driven market growth, share growth, and sales growth we\u2019ve achieved with products like Tide and Ariel pods, Downy and Lenor laundry scent beads, and Dawn and Fairy easy squeeze and power wash. Two more examples : Oral B IO power toothbrushes deliver superior cleaning and delightful user experience. Superior communication includes the insight that manual brushes leave 50% of plaque behind, but Oral B IO delivers 100% more plaque bacterial removal with its round head and removes plaque in hard to reach places. This superior proposition is accelerating power brush trial and adoption, bringing new power brush users into the category, driving high single digit market growth of the power brush category, double digit sales growth for Oral B power, and two points of Oral B value share growth over the past 12 months. Native, our premium personal care brand is delivering superiority across all five vectors and across multiple product forms, including deodorants, body wash, shampoo and conditioners, superior performance with fewer ingredients and irresistible scents. Transparent labeling and clean white packaging, superior retail execution and strong retailer partnerships showcasing the full range of forms and scents. Premium positioning with the category providing superior value for the consumer looking for an offering with more natural ingredients. Native has driven a step change in market value growth for the U.S. deodorants and personal care categories from low singles to mid teens. Native sales have grown nearly 10 times over the last five years to over $700 million in fiscal \u201924. Third strategy element, productivity improvement in all areas of our operations. In order to fund investments in innovation, brand building and market growth to mitigate cost and currency challenges and to expand margins and generate cash. We delivered very strong cost savings in fiscal \u201924. Visibility to more savings opportunities is increasing as the businesses continue to build their three-year rolling productivity master plans. We have an objective for gross savings in cost of goods sold of up to $1.5 billion before tax, enabled by platform programs with global application across categories like supply chains 3.0. We\u2019re working in a new way with retailers on the totality of the supply chain end to end versus simply trying to optimize our respective pieces. One example using data and machine learning algorithms to optimize truck scheduling to minimize idle time for drivers. We\u2019re also using digital tools to optimize fill rates and for our dynamic routing and sourcing optimization. $200 million to $300 million of savings opportunity across these areas. We have line of sight to savings from improved marketing productivity. More efficiency and greater effectiveness, avoiding excess frequency and reducing waste while increasing reach. We\u2019re taking targeted steps to reduce overhead as we digitize more of our operations. Next, constructive disruption of ourselves and our industry, a willingness to change, adapt and create new trends, technologies and capabilities that will shape the future of our industry and extend our competitive advantage. We continue to be a constructive disruptor of brand building, in-housing more of the media planning and placement activity using our proprietary tools and consumer data to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of our communication. We\u2019re disrupting traditional lab-based innovation models to dramatically increase the speed and breadth of discovery. Last but clearly not least, we\u2019ve designed and continued to refine an empowered, agile and accountable organization, an inclusive and diverse organization, enabling us to better serve an increasingly diverse set of consumers. Strong progress across all strategic pillars with significant opportunity ahead of us. No reason to stand still, as illustrated by the four focus areas that we\u2019ve outlined previously. Number one, supply chain 3.0, it\u2019s delivering productivity, as you can see in the results. We\u2019re also driving improved agility, flexibility, scalability and transparency in a rapidly evolving landscape. Optimized sustainable and flexible up and down the supply chain, inclusive of our retail partners. All of this is driving higher quality, increased supply assurance, and higher on-shelf availability of our products, and of course better cash and cost structures. These programs improve superiority with consumers and further strength what is already the top ranked supply chain by our retail partners in third party industry surveys. Next, environmental sustainability. Superior propositions for consumers, customers and share owners that are more sustainable. Driving sales and profitability while reducing the footprint of our operations, enabling consumers to reduce their footprint and innovating to deliver cross-industry solutions for some of our most pressing challenges. The next focus area is digital acumen, leveraging data and digitization to delight consumers , streamline the supply chain, increase quality, drive productivity, all driving share owner value. One example is the improvement we\u2019ve delivered in ad copy qualification and media buying with proprietary digital tools we\u2019ve developed and the digital molecule development work in fabric care. We\u2019ve built similar tools to drive faster, cheaper and better innovation in perfume, which benefits almost every product category in the company. We\u2019re also digitizing more of our back office work processes to lower costs and drive efficiencies while delivering higher quality output. Each of these examples has obvious cost benefits, but they\u2019re also driving product and package superiority, superior brand communication to consumers, superior retail execution in store and online, stronger internal controls and jobs that enable people to focus on higher order tasks with greater business impact. Last focus area, a superior value equation for all employees, for all roles to ensure we continue to attract, retain and develop the best talent and are best positioned to serve all consumers. These four focus areas are not separate strategies, they simply strengthen our ability to execute our integrated growth strategy. Our strategic choices on portfolio, superiority, productivity, constructive disruption of our organization reinforce and build on each other. We continue to believe there\u2019s merit in doubling down on this integrated strategy, starting with a commitment to deliver irresistibly superior propositions to consumers and retail partners, fueled by productivity. We remain as confident as ever in our strategy and our ability to drive market growth and to deliver balanced growth in value creation to delight consumers, customers, employees, society and share owners. At the end of the day, P&G serves people with a strong desire to improve their lives and the lives of their families. I believe in the capabilities and commitment of P&G people to serve consumers and to do this in the most responsible way, consistent with P&G\u2019s values and principles. I\u2019m excited about what lays ahead. Of course we\u2019ll continue to face challenges, but the future holds great promise. We have many opportunities ahead to grow markets, grow our business, and create significant value for our owners. With that, I\u2019ll hand it back to Andre to outline our guidance for the new year. Andre Schulten : Thank you Jon. As we enter fiscal \u201925, we continue to expect the environment around us to remain volatile and challenging, from input costs, currencies, to consumers, competitors, retailers, and geopolitical dynamics. As Jon said, we\u2019ll navigate these challenges with our dynamic integrated strategy guided by consumers every step of the way. Our going-in guidance for fiscal \u201925 is consistent with our long term algorithm. On the top line, we currently expect the markets in which we compete to deliver local currency sales growth in the range of 3% to 4% for the year. Our objective is to grow organic sales modestly ahead of the underlying growth in these markets. This translates to an organic sales growth guidance range of 3% to 5% for the fiscal year - apologies, I had my mic muted. On the bottom line, our algorithm calls for mid to high single digit core earnings per share growth. Our core EPS guidance range for fiscal \u201925 starts the year at 5% to 7% versus fiscal \u201924 core EPS of $6.59. This guidance equates to a range of $6.91 to $7.05 per share, $6.98 up 6% at the center of the range. This outlook includes a commodity cost headwind of approximately $300 million after tax and a foreign exchange headwind of approximately $200 million after tax. Combined, foreign exchange and commodities are projected to be a headwind of $0.20 per share for fiscal \u201925, or a 3 percentage point drag on core EPS growth. In addition, the prior fiscal year included benefits from several minor brand divestitures, and we expect a somewhat higher tax rate in the new fiscal year. Combined, these are an additional $0.10 to $0.12 headwind to core EPS. We expect adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% for the year. This includes an increase in capital spending as we add capacity in several categories. We expect to pay around $10 billion in dividends and to repurchase $6 billion to $7 billion of common stock, combined a plan to return $16 billion to $17 billion of cash to share owners this fiscal year. While we are clear eyed on the challenges in the market and the work needed to continue to drive the business, fiscal \u201925 guidance for top line, bottom line and cash are each consistent with our long term algorithm. A few items for you to consider as you build your quarter-to-quarter estimates. On the top line, please keep in mind that the July to September period has the most difficult comp for the year, and many of the market-level challenges we\u2019ve noted will not fully annualize or improve materially in our estimate until the second half of the year. On the bottom line, the foreign exchange and commodity headwinds skew a bit toward the front half of the year, and the back half comps include the benefit of the tax items and minor brand divestitures I mentioned earlier. This outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Significant additional currency weakness, commodity cost increases, geopolitical disruptions, major supply chain disruptions, or store closures are not anticipated within the guidance ranges. With that, I\u2019ll hand it back to Jon for his closing thoughts. Jon Moeller : We\u2019re very pleased with the strong results P&G people have delivered over the last year and inclusive of prior years in a very challenging and volatile environment. The earnings power and value creation potential of the company are as strong as ever. We continue to believe that the best path forward to deliver sustainable, balanced growth is to double down on the strategy, excellent execution of an integrated set of market constructive strategies delivered with a focus on balanced top and bottom line growth and value creation, starting with a commitment to deliver irresistibly superior propositions to consumers and retail partners. With that, we will be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] Our first question will come from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Bryan Spillane : Thanks Operator, and good morning everyone. I guess the question that we\u2019ve fielded a few times this morning, and if you could touch on this a bit, the last couple of quarters, it seems like organic sales have come in maybe slower or lower than expected--than you were expecting at the start of each quarter, so maybe if you can touch a little bit on just what\u2019s developed, especially in the fourth quarter, maybe different than what you were expecting, and then if you can add to that also, is that true for the market? At a 2% organic sales for this quarter, are we above, below, or in line with market growth? Thanks. Andre Schulten : Morning Bryan. I\u2019ll start and then Jon, I\u2019m sure, will add some perspective as well. I\u2019ll start back where we kind of started the prepared remarks. I think we delivered a year where we exceeded on that, all of our in-going guidance metrics. Now, the year wasn\u2019t linear, as you highlight, and I\u2019d distinguish two parts of the business. Eighty-five percent of the business is performing right in line with expectations, and right in line with what we would have expected throughout the year. We have strong growth in North America, 4% in the quarter, 4% volume growth in the quarter. Europe focus markets growing volumes at 3%, Europe enterprise markets growing volumes at 6%, LA normalizing to about 8% organic sales growth, so that\u2019s part of the business where the trajectory is not impacted by significant external events. I think it\u2019s moving right along. We expected the normalization and price-mix contribution, as we have talked throughout the quarters. If you look at the headwinds that we started to communicate in December, they are really still with us in--throughout the second half, and that\u2019s what\u2019s driving the volatility in the top line results. Those headwinds have accelerated in part, and honestly in quarter four, some of them developed late in the quarter, so when you think about China and SK-II, we\u2019re heavily impacted by 6/18, a weaker key consumption period in China, and overall market sentiment in China has not improved throughout H2. We had highlighted that we expect the China recovery to be slow and to take time, and I think that\u2019s playing out in the results we see in the second half. The Middle East situation has not really improved, so we continue to see developing stronger impacts on western retailers in some of these markets, and while the team has implemented many interventions, the execution in-store has been limited by some of these headwinds in the Middle East. The last element, we saw a softening in quarter four on the Argentina volumes driven by the general circumstances in the market, strong high translation pricing in Argentina, so there was a softer contribution on organic sales growth in quarter four than what we\u2019d seen in quarter three. If you step back, though, the performance of the business and the way we set up for \u201925, I think is very strong. Eighty five of the business is developing right in line with what we would have expected. We\u2019re growing share in North America. The balance of the markets are growing volume, which is really the shift we needed to see. Our gross margin is at record levels. Our productivity is very strong. That has enabled us to remain fully invested from a media perspective and from an innovation perspective, and so going into the year, we feel all the structural elements of the business are strong. Now, what is important to understand, and we mentioned it in the prepared remarks, those headwinds that we have experienced in H2 will still be with us in H1 of this fiscal year, so we expect this year not to be linear and we have to accelerate sales growth throughout the quarters as some of these headwinds annualize and we return to growth. But overall, I think we\u2019re well set up to deliver against the guidance metrics we just communicated. Jon Moeller : I agree with everything that Andre just said. I would remind you relative to the comment of performing versus our own expectations, precisely because of the volatility of the world that we all live and operate in, we don\u2019t provide quarterly guidance, we only provide annual guidance, and as Andre said, we met our beat, each of those numbers that were provided. There have been two primary questions that have been--that we\u2019ve all been working through. One is can we re-accelerate volume, and as Andre said, that is broadly happening and impressively so. If you look at North America over the course of the fiscal year, plus-3, plus-3, plus-4, plus-3. If we look at Europe, plus-2, plus-3, plus-4, plus-2. Andre gave you figures for some of the other regions, but broadly that question f can volume be re-accelerated is answered with an emphatic yes. The second question that at least we\u2019ve been working through is, can that happen in the context of continued margin expansion? If you look at the fiscal year numbers, top line to bottom line that\u2019s definitely happened. If you look at gross margin in the quarter we just completed, which comes in at a 17-year high, we\u2019re certainly able to continue to re-accelerate volume growth while holding or building margins. Like Andre, I approach next year in a realistic fashion and realizing that the first couple quarters are going to look a little bit more like the one we just completed, but with overall a belief that the fundamentals of the business are in very strong shape and that as we bring the innovation that\u2019s planned to market throughout the fiscal year, we\u2019re going to be happy with the results in line with the guidance that he\u2019s provided. One other element of the strength and health of the business fundamentally, if you look at the last fiscal year at a brand level, 21 out of 25 brands were growing. Eleven of those 25 brands were growing at high single digits or higher rates, so again from a breadth standpoint, I think we\u2019re positioned very well and the team\u2019s doing a great job. Operator : The next question comes from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Dara Mohsenian : Hey, good morning. I actually just wanted to follow up on those last two points you made, Jon. On the 3% to 5% organic sales growth guidance for fiscal \u201925, can you just parse out a bit more detail in terms of how you\u2019re thinking about the balance between pricing and volume? I know you won\u2019t want to be exact, but how you\u2019re thinking about that and the 3% to 4% category growth assumption, do you think there\u2019s good visibility there given the slowing pricing, and then if you bless me with a Part B, I guess just how do you think about earnings flex relative to top line, given some of the top line volatility, obviously significant year-over-year gross margin expansion in fiscal \u201924 but that\u2019s been dissipating, you boosted marketing a lot, you\u2019ve got strong productivity, as you mentioned, so there\u2019s a lot going on sort of in the margin line items, so just how do you think about earnings flex next year relative to top line growth, given some of this volatility? Thanks. Jon Moeller : Thanks Dara. I\u2019m going to turn it over to Andre to take us through some of the details, and then I\u2019ll round out the answer. Go ahead, Andre. Andre Schulten : Yes, thanks for the question, Dara. The volume versus price mix contribution is expected to be broadly balanced. We expected markets to return to more sustainable growth rates of 3% to 4% - that is largely happening now, and if you look at the construction of that market growth, about half of that is driven by volume, the other half is driven by price mix. I would expect our construct to look similar for the fiscal year. Obviously it will differ by quarter and front half versus back half, but broadly balanced between volume and price mix. On the margin perspective, you saw us make a choice to continue to invest fully in the business. We have delivered very strong productivity, more than $2 billion in productivity for the year, and we have significantly increased our media support, and we see the results for those investments in the strong growth we continue to deliver in North America, including share growth consistently across every period. The strong results in Europe focus markets, including strong volume growth consistent across the quarters, so we feel good about those investments. We\u2019ll continue to be very disciplined and, as you can appreciate, not all of those investments will have paid out, so as we do our post-event analysis, we\u2019ll re-assess every step of the way, whether those are better flowing to the P&L or reinvested somewhere else. Productivity for fiscal \u201925 is also very strong, as I mentioned in my previous comments, so that will allow us to maintain fully invested both in terms of market support, as well as innovation, which is really the underpinning driver for our growth next year. Jon Moeller : I would just add two or three comments. One, as Andre indicated, where you see the increase in marketing investment, that is largely in the geographies where we\u2019re seeing the growth accompany that from a top line standpoint. As he also said, we will continue to monitor the effectiveness of that spending and will adjust either up or down accordingly. Also, I just want to make sure we all understand the return on those investments is not an overnight occurrence. We have a commercialization cycle that needs to run its course, we have consumer purchase cycles that can be annual in some cases. While our portfolio is constructed to focus on categories where the product is used daily, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s purchased daily, and so it sometimes takes a little bit of time to evaluate and see the market response to those investments. But if you look at the last several years, it\u2019s generally always been there, and it\u2019s been one of the reasons for the growth over the last, call it six years as I mentioned in my remarks - plus-5, plus-6, plus-6, plus-7, plus-7, plus-4 in a more challenging environment. Like Andre, I feel good about the balance that\u2019s implied in the guidance and in our internal plans, but it\u2019s something we wake up every day and continue to re-evaluate and deliver in an optimal way. Operator : The next question comes from Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Steve Powers : Good morning guys, thank you. I was hoping that we could talk about fabric and home and baby and family specifically. It seems like those are the two segments that drove the most disconnect, at least versus external forecasts. The release cites promotional spending and at least a degree of share loss across those segments, so maybe you could just drill down further into the headline numbers, give us a bit more context of what you\u2019re seeing, both competitively and within your own momentum, and just how we should think about both the drivers and the timing of the build back in those businesses, noting you\u2019ve obviously got some challenging first half comparisons especially in the current quarter, but just really understanding where you expect those businesses to trend and land over the course of fiscal \u201925. Andre Schulten : Morning Steve. Look - home care, I think is just performing outstandingly well, 9% organic sales growth on the year, 13 quarters of sustained share growth and gaining momentum, so I think I\u2019d focus my comments on fabric care. I would tell you two things. Number one, we are annualizing record periods in Europe with differentiated pricing between competitors, where we had a bit of a tailwind last year that is turning into a high base comp. But structurally, the business is in great shape in Europe - Ariel continues to perform extremely well, the innovation across unit dose and the broader portfolio, including FE, is doing very well, so I expect that business to re-accelerate very quickly. In North America, we are just launching the innovation bundle, the spring innovation bundle which is supported with the right level of investment, including promotion investment and merchandising investment, and that\u2019s why you see the negative price mix component in the North American business. But the business is picking up momentum, we\u2019re growing share, so I expect also North America to continue to move in the right direction on fabric care, and we\u2019re very encouraged with the innovation, both the innovation that just launched and the innovation that is in the pipeline. Last point maybe on fabric care, in China specifically, we also made a portfolio choice to focus on the most profitable part of the business, and so there are some short term implications in terms of base period there. Again, for the longer term, benefit of the China fabric care business, I think that\u2019s the right decision, but it\u2019s part of the softness that you see right now in the current quarter. Baby care, I\u2019ll talk two regions. One is North America - the baby care business on the premium end continues to be doing very well. We have Swaddlers growing share by 1.4%, Cruisers 360 is growing, so on the premium end of the spectrum where we\u2019ve been able to innovate over the past one to two years, we continue to see the momentum accelerating across Pampers. We have an opportunity, we\u2019ve had an opportunity on Luvs, the mid-tier brand, where we postponed innovation due to some supply chain challenges. That innovation is now in the market, so again very significant acceleration expected given the innovation just launched in the market over the next few quarters. In Europe, again base period mostly in terms of share data, and that is something we need to work through, and certainly in Europe baby, I think that\u2019s one of the areas where we\u2019re watching our sufficiency of innovation very closely, simply because the spread versus private label is the most significant, so again the team is working through strong communication and innovation that will be launching here over the next few quarters. Jon Moeller : I\u2019m just going to go in a slightly different direction here, Steve. I fully agree with Andre\u2019s description. There are also categories and sectors that are making really strong progress, that as we annualize the few challenges within them should manifest itself more clearly than it is now, so we\u2019ll have the benefit of those as we go through the year. What am I talking about? If you look at beauty as an example, the aggregate results are being heavily impacted by two things : SK-II and China, both of which should annualize by the second half of the year. If you then step back and look at the balance of the business, Head & Shoulders, in part behind the BARE innovation, increased sales by 7% last year. Pantene, in part behind the Pantene Miracles innovation, grew 10% last year. The personal care side of the business is growing extremely well as well. I just want to kind of complete the picture in terms of some of the progress that isn\u2019t as obvious in an aggregate look, but will make a difference going forward. Operator : The next question comes from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Please go ahead. Lauren Lieberman : Great, thanks. I was wondering if you could comment a bit, because one thing that\u2019s been absent is a discussion is the consumer broadly, so I think it could be helpful to get some perspective on the consumer environment. It feels like in U.S. and Western Europe, from what we\u2019ve heard from other companies, things in the last month or two have kind of gotten demonstrably worse, as a general statement, so curious your perspective on that, and then also differences in channel performance and what you\u2019re doing around that in terms of areas of particular focus or investment. Thanks. Jon Moeller : From a consumer standpoint, we generally don\u2019t see the dynamic that some are describing, and I\u2019m not meaning to discredit their descriptions, but if you look at a couple of dynamics, private label shares as an example, which typically would be increasing during a time of significant consumer pressure, that\u2019s not what we\u2019re seeing. Private label shares generally both in North America and Europe are in line with pre-COVID levels, and period to period, so last quarter to this quarter, are not changing significantly. The second data point that we look at to assess the answer to your question is back to volume, is unit growth declining, and that\u2019s again not what we\u2019re generally seeing. Now, certainly there are some consumers that are, I\u2019m sure, under increased pressure and are probably modifying their behavior and purchases correspondingly, but in our categories--and remember, of course, these are less discretionary categories, these are daily use categories where performance drives brand choice. We typically have the best performing product in the market, at least that\u2019s our objective, and as a result, we\u2019re not seeing any significant consumer-driven impact. I\u2019ve been in Europe quite a bit recently, I\u2019ll be back there tomorrow, Andre was there earlier in the month of June with many of you at the Deutsch Bank conference, but also spent time with our business, and I\u2019m not seeing it there either. We remain encouraged as we go forward. It\u2019s something that we\u2019re very cognizant of and watch very closely, but so far, so good. Andre Schulten : And the market growth rates, I think substantiate the point that Jon made. If you look at the U.S., I think the key point is over the past one, three, six, 12 months, the category volume growth in our categories is consistently 2%, so consumers are not decelerating consumption across our categories, and similarly if you look at value growth in Europe, it\u2019s also very consistent over the same period, so as Jon said, we\u2019re watching it, but we don\u2019t see it in the data. Jon Moeller : And even--you know, if we look at the responsiveness to many of our strong innovations, I mentioned in my remarks Oral B IO, which is a significant premium to the balance both within the power segment and across power and manual, and it\u2019s growing at double digits. We built two share points in the last year, so just an example of responsiveness to strong innovation in these categories where performance drives brand choice. Operator : The next question comes from Robert Ottenstein of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Robert Ottenstein : Great, thank you very much. A couple of follow-ups. Could you just talk a little bit about the enterprise markets, what they would have looked like ex-Argentina, and then as you look at your guidance, how much of an actual rebound in China are you assuming, how much, if any, rebound in the Middle East issues are you assuming, and is that part of the range or is there no rebound at all in the range, if that\u2019s clear? Thank you. Andre Schulten : Hey Robert. Enterprise markets, I think in aggregate are performing strongly for the year, up 6%, last year they were up, I think 10%, so I think very strong continued growth. Latin America, as we said, is growing on the year 15% and in the most recent quarter 8%. Europe focus markets up 8% for the year. Where we see headwinds is in the Middle East, in line with what we have described, so you see our Asia-Middle East-Africa markets impacted by those Middle East headwinds, and again we expect those to be temporary. The Argentina contribution to the total number is decreasing by almost a point quarter-over-quarter, so it was only 30 basis points in the current quarter. Most importantly, we divested the Argentina business, so that effect will not matter anymore in the current year because it will be removed from the organic sales base as we move through the quarter here. In terms of assumptions, I think that\u2019s part of the range, right? I would say we largely assume annualization. The upper end of the range would assume some level of improvement, but I think the main contribution to the midpoint of the range would be a normalization and annualization of those headwinds we were describing, including China, SK-II, the Middle East, and again Argentina coming out of the base because of the divestiture of the business. Jon Moeller : And Robert, my view of those things as its reflected in guidance generally or indirectly is just as Andre described, which is annualization. I think if things improve either in the Middle East or China, we should have the opportunity to deliver, ceteris paribus, even better results than the midpoint of the guidance range. On the other hand, we\u2019re not assuming--I\u2019m not assuming that they get worse, and that can always happen, so I think we\u2019re centered on a realistic expectation of outcomes. Operator : The next question comes from Andrea Teixeira of JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you, good morning. I was hoping you could talk about a bit of the pricing elasticity you\u2019re seeing in the category. I do understand what, Jon, you just described as being a very low penetration of private label and consumers are still driving the preference for your brands, but just curious about in laundry specifically, you had some promo, and some of the things that you had discussed are not necessarily driven by [indiscernible], but just wondering how you\u2019re seeing as we see more pricing coming through in this view. You\u2019re planning embedding in your base guidance, I understand it\u2019s a balanced approach to the organic sales growth for the midpoint at 4%, but wondering if there is any way of mitigating some of the effect in some of these other places which is natural, and therefore we can see some pricing go through inflation led and some pricing also led by innovation. Thank you. Andre Schulten : Hey Andrea. Yes, I mean, pricing and mix have been a positive contribution to our results for 19 years. I don\u2019t expect this year to be different. I think it will be pricing for foreign exchange headwinds in some of the enterprise markets, which is in line with what the market generally executes. I also expect innovation base pricing and trade-up as we have a strong innovation pipeline in the year. From a promotion environment, we see stability at the moment. We have pockets of incremental promotion. We\u2019re still operating at about 85% versus pre-COVID levels, and we see general stability, so as I said in the guidance deconstruction on the top line, roughly we see the market half price mix driven, half volume driven. I don\u2019t expect our fiscal year numbers to be different than that, but they will look different obviously H1 versus H2 because of base period, but the general model is still the same as we executed over the last 19 years. Operator : The next question comes from Filippo Falorni of Citi. Please go ahead. Filippo Falorni : Hi, good morning everyone. I wanted to ask about the commodity outlook. Andre, you mentioned $300 million in headwind expected in fiscal \u201925. Can you maybe talk about the components of the headwind, some of the key commodities including pulp, resins, and also on the transportation side, given the recent rise in ocean freight, any potential impact there? Then in terms of--I know some of the commodities, you cannot hedge, but just the level of visibility given your contracted rates on that headwind, thank you. Andre Schulten : Yes, hey Filippo. The commodity portfolio is actually at the moment relatively stable. Most of that headwind that is in the guidance is pulp at the moment. We continue to see strong demand on some of the grades and limited supply, so that\u2019s driving the run-up. The rest of the portfolio is actually stable. It won\u2019t be that throughout the year, as you know - I mean, these things change quickly, so there\u2019s a level of variability here, obviously, and we\u2019re forecasting a spot rate as we always do. The commodity effect as we think through visibility, look - I mean, the flow through is different by commodity class, but I think we discussed this when we were in the middle of the commodity crisis, it generally takes three months to nine months to flow through the P&L, so I think at the end of quarter one, we probably had relatively good visibility on most of it through H1, and then we\u2019ll go step by step. But again, this is one that we forecast on spot, we don\u2019t hedge, so the flow through again is the key driver of latency in terms of P&L, in terms of P&L effect. Transportation, look - generally energy, oil is relatively stable, so overall transportation is flat. Yes, we see some impact from increased transportation on the sea routes, but it is not material in the context of the year at this point. Operator : The next question is from Peter Grom of UBS. Please go ahead. Peter Grom : Thanks Operator, good morning everyone. Hope you\u2019re doing well. I wanted to go back to Lauren\u2019s question on the consumer, and totally recognize that you may not be seeing some of the indicators that the consumer is under pressure today, but when we think about the 3% to 4% category growth assumptions you\u2019re embedding for your outlook, is there any cushion for the 85% of the markets that are currently performing well to potentially slow at all? I totally get the annualization commentary on the Middle East and China, but just would love to get some perspective on what you expect maybe in North America and Western Europe from here. Thanks. Andre Schulten : Hey Peter. Yes, the 3% to 4% is a global number. Deconstructing that by market or by region is increasingly difficult, and we somewhat rely on the total aggregate of regions to play out in that 3% to 4% range. To your question on the 85% of the business slowing, what we see is actually what we had expected, right, that those regions slow down from a market growth in the range of 5% to 8% to this 3% to 4$ range, because the price mix component is coming down and the volume component is coming up, and that stabilization is built into our assumption for the year, so we expect most of those regions to play out the same way that we\u2019re projecting the global number, which is 3% to 4%, half of it volume, half of it price mix. Operator : The next question comes from Bonnie Herzog of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Bonnie Herzog : Thank you, good morning. I had a question on your beauty segment. China has been a drag to your volumes for a while, as you mentioned, and we\u2019ve been hearing about the ongoing challenges in the region. But more recently, we\u2019re also hearing about the slowdown in the U.S. beauty market, so curious if that\u2019s consistent with what you\u2019re seeing, and then how should we think about the growth potential for your beauty segment this fiscal year, and is it fair to assume that these challenges could drive a further slowdown from here? Thanks. Andre Schulten : Hey Bonnie. If you look at the beauty results outside of China and SK-II, I think they give a better indication of the growth potential and trajectory we\u2019re on. The business ex-SK-II is growing 6% in quarter four, 7% in the fiscal year that we just closed. When you go through the segments and the core brands, if you look at Head & Shoulders, Pantene, Herbal Essences, for example, grew high single digits to double digits. Those were the best results in the past five years. When you look at our personal care business, Old Spice, Secret and Native, double digit growth. We talked about--Jon talked about Native now being and reaching $700 million in sales, 10 times what we got the brand with, and our new brands, [indiscernible] are also growing double digits, so I think we see strength across the portfolio there. North America hair care is up 12%, global hair care is up 9%, and the personal care business, as I said, is doing very well. I think the core of the piece we are annualizing is really China, both on the Olay business and on the SK-II business, and as we said, our expectation is that we\u2019ll annualize. We don\u2019t yet assume a material acceleration in the fiscal year, so I\u2019ll leave it there. But again, I think the core of the business is strong, China is the one piece we need to see annualize across the first half. Jon Moeller : And obviously we play in--the majority of the spaces that we play in, in beauty are more foundational versus prestige, and I think where some of the commentary in the marketplace has been directed relative to slowdown is really not in the base segments that we play in and, as Andre said, have continued to see very strong growth in. That\u2019s why I wanted to add to the question earlier, because I think it\u2019s somewhat lost in the aggregate numbers, but I think it\u2019s important both for recognition of the team but also recognition of the potential. Operator : The next question comes from Chris Carey of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Chris Carey : Hi, good morning. I know we\u2019re later in the call, so apologies for another China question, but maybe a bit more focus. It has been sluggish for a few years, which I think is why there\u2019s been so many questions about the effect of annualizing. You\u2019re not the only company to see slower results in China, so I wonder if you could just maybe comment on clearly there are macro dynamics in the market versus micro parts of your portfolio which specifically need some work. SK-II has been well covered by this point, so perhaps you can speak to some other businesses that are performing in line with your expectations or not, so that we can have a bit more of a portfolio view on why the annualization should deliver the outcomes you\u2019re expecting into the back half of the year. Sorry for another question on China, but it felt important. Thanks. Andre Schulten : Hey Chris. I\u2019ll start and Jon will add. Let me start by saying, I think the China business coming from a double-digit growth trajectory through a significant dip, and we don\u2019t expect it to go back to double digits, we expect it over time to go to maybe mid singles, so more in line with what we see in other developed markets. For sure, we don\u2019t expect the return to the growth rates that we saw pre-COVID. Many of the effects specifically in China, SK-II, I think the run rate is now stable, so we\u2019re already seeing the run rate in terms of absolute volume and absolute dollar sale flattening. What\u2019s not yet there is the base period in line with those run rates, so unless we see a significant run rate reduction, that gives us confidence that the annualization would take place. Maybe other point of confidence here, the toughest category to compete in, in China right now is probably baby care. Birth rates are down 15% to 25% depending on how you define the market, and we\u2019ve been able--the team has been able to grow sales 6% and grow share in the market. Why? Because the portfolio and the innovation the team designed was very specific to the Chinese consumer - their needs, their preference in terms of superiority, and that\u2019s driving results. We\u2019ve been able to grow the Braun business with strong innovation, so there are pockets of business where we are leading the market, and we need to find our way to that across more categories, which we\u2019re working on. Fabric care, as I said, is very focused on the profitable part of the portfolio which allows them to drive innovation, which allows them to drive category growth, and that\u2019s really what\u2019s playing out across categories. But I think the most mechanical driver is run rates are stable and stabilizing, therefore unless we see a further decline in the market, which is entirely possible, but if those run rates hold, that will drive annualization towards the back half of the year. Jon Moeller : Just to round that out, the largest business for P&G in China is hair care, and we spent the last year-plus as we came out of COVID ensuring that we had very strong hair care plans. I am very pleased with the plans that we\u2019ve put together and the execution of them on Pantene, the same on Head & Shoulders, really significantly improved propositions, significantly improved packaging, really looking strong. Andre mentioned somewhere in our discussion that we had made the choice to exit the third brand, which was Vidal Sassoon, so that should not be a source of drag going forward. We\u2019re still working, to be candid, on the plans for Rejoice, but the net of all of that is pretty encouraging. Operator : The next question comes from Kevin Grundy of BNP Paribas. Please go ahead. Kevin Grundy : Great, thanks. Good morning everyone. A question for both of you, perhaps, just on some context for investment levels, specifically trade spending in advertising and marketing, which are clearly moving higher. Gross margin and expansion there has naturally been supportive. I know it\u2019s not lost on you guys, you\u2019ve seen what your key competitor in oral care is doing, advertising and marketing there was the highest as a percent of sales in at least a couple decades, we\u2019ve seen trade spending move higher there in their North America segment. Advertising and marketing now for Procter has moved up 200 basis points this year, including a big step up of 300 basis points in the quarter, and we talked earlier on the call about [indiscernible] fabric care, so it\u2019s kind of a big [indiscernible]. If you could offer some context here for higher investment levels broadly we\u2019re seeing in the industry and then perhaps a push from a Procter perspective is are we satisfied with the top line payback that we\u2019re seeing, because spending levels are moving higher and the push would be towards sales, understanding some of the idiosyncratic items in the quarter, was a little bit soft and we\u2019re kind of guiding for growth similar to what we\u2019ve seen historically. Thank you for all that, but context and any color would be appreciated. Thank you. Andre Schulten : Yes, let me start, Kevin - morning. Generally, what I\u2019d tell you is the--we\u2019re happy with the payout that we\u2019re seeing in the markets where we can read the payout cleanly, and that\u2019s really where 95% of the investment is, meaning Europe focus markets, some of the Europe enterprise markets, Latin America and North America, and I think the top line results support the overall payout of the aggregate of the media spend. We\u2019ll obviously go way lower in terms of penetration, and it is probably the strongest push that both Jon and I and Shailesh have as we engage with the businesses to ensure that that spending truly is productive, truly is driving market growth and sales growth, and therefore helps us to deliver top line and bottom line for the quarter and for the fiscal year. If that\u2019s no longer the case, then we will change gears and adjust. In terms of overall spend, I\u2019m actually pleased to see increase in media spend and market support that\u2019s market constructive. I think it helps the consumer understand the category better. It helps drive penetration, which is still a huge opportunity across multiple categories, so that\u2019s very positive. Again, the promotion environment in aggregate remains productive, and as long as those two results in what we see in North America, which is sustained volume growth on the category and sustained value growth on the category, I think we\u2019re in a good place. Jon Moeller : And you know, it\u2019s something I\u2019ve been pushing, we\u2019ve been pushing for some period of time. When you have a strategy that\u2019s centered on innovation and superiority and you have in some cases relatively low levels of advertising reach, that total equation doesn\u2019t make sense. We used to call it--David Taylor used to call it confidential superiority. We\u2019re trying to, in an effective way and in the most efficient way we can, and I mentioned this earlier, increase reach so that more consumers are aware of our products and the benefits that they provide them. Obviously that effort at some point reaches the right level of maturity, but we\u2019re still on the incline curve in that regard right now, which I think is entirely the right thing to do. As I mentioned earlier, it takes some time temporally for the business to respond. It does not respond overnight, again because of purchase cycles and commercialization cycles themselves, but as Andre said, take some assurance that you\u2019ve got a former CFO in the CEO\u2019s chair, between the two of us, we\u2019re not interested in wasting your money. Operator : The next question comes from Olivia Tong of Raymond James. Please go ahead. Olivia Tong : Great, thanks. Good morning. Just a follow-up on promotions, if you could just talk about how much is competitors catching up on innovation, driving you to spend more to stay superior, versus a response to the tougher macros and needing to make yourself competitive on price. Then more importantly, you\u2019ve obviously done substantial innovation at the premium end. What are you doing as we think about this evolving macro in your mid tier products to remind consumers of the value proposition there? Thank you. Andre Schulten : Hey Olivia. I think our job is to lead market growth via irresistible superiority, and that starts with product, package and communication, but it includes value as you point out. I don\u2019t see that equation shifting. The competitive environment in terms of promotion is relatively stable. Our approach to promotion is relatively stable across the regions where we have the highest visibility, which is Europe and North America, so I don\u2019t view that equation as being different. Again, I think our stance on superiority, which we\u2019ve talked about now for almost a year, to reset the level of superiority we expect our businesses to deliver, which moves from your job is no longer to just win against the next best competitor in the market but is to create superiority at a level where consumers are drawn into the category, so we create new consumption, we create new consumers coming into the category, increasing their usage or trading up, that\u2019s really what we are measuring ourselves against, and I think we\u2019re making very good progress and I\u2019m very confident in the innovation pipeline we see for the current year. I\u2019m sure Jon has to add more. On the mid-tier, absolutely our job is to be irresistibly superior at every tier we compete in, and that\u2019s why the Luvs innovation is a great example, where--and it\u2019s a great example for the strategy at work, because if we are not superior in the mid-tier, the consumer tells us and it shows in the results. So the counter-action to innovate and drive superiority is what we do, and it\u2019s really independent of the tier, so at any given point in time, we need to make sure that we deliver all five vectors at every tier, every pack size, every price point in every channel we compete in. Jon Moeller : If you just assume for a minute, Olivia, that we\u2019re wrong in the ongoing discussion that we\u2019ve had about consumers being under pressure, and our contention is that that really hasn\u2019t manifested itself as of yet, but just assume that we\u2019re wrong or that that changes going forward, and to your question on innovation, it becomes very important that we\u2019re innovating in categories that are going to become--that are going to see even higher levels of demand, if in fact there\u2019s any kind of consumer downturn. Andre mentioned Luvs. Another example--I mean, what happens if there\u2019s a consumer downturn, people eat at home more often, they\u2019re going out less frequently, traveling less frequently, and so categories like hand dishwashing, for example, become important, and our levels of innovation in that category, just as an example, are significant between power spray on Dawn and easy squeeze, and Andre mentioned the growth rates that we\u2019re seeing in our dish business. Typically, and this was certainly the case in COVID, which was an extreme condition, but people use more paper products if they\u2019re staying home more often, so things like the Charmin easy tear scallop perforation, which is driving significant levels of delight and 5% growth on the Charmin business last year, is another example of innovating, continuing to innovate in categories that are going to potentially be even more relevant in the event of a consumer downturn, and obviously just in general, that hand wash business is more of, if you will, a midtier business than the auto dish business, so there\u2019s no discrimination in terms of our commitment to innovation. Operator : The next question comes from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Please go ahead. Mark Astrachan : Yes, thanks and good morning everybody. I wanted to ask about SK-II more broadly and just how do you see this part of today\u2019s portfolio for P&G. You know, I guess the slower improvement in China than anticipated, but just curious if you take a look over the last, call it four or five years, it does seem like the brand has grown in totality a little bit below what I\u2019d peg as the peer group, so I guess I\u2019m curious why you think that is, how you weave in improving trends in China with the overall expectations for the brand on a go-forward basis, and I say all that too in the context of weakness pre-dating the wastewater release in Japan, so what is there? Is there more competition, are you doing more from an innovation standpoint to broaden the appeal for the brand? Can you move it beyond prestige skin care? Just broader strokes, again in the context of how does it fit within the portfolio, thank you. Andre Schulten : Yes, hey Mark. I think your question is specifically on China. I don\u2019t think our brand portfolio is something that I would be unhappy with. I think the brand portfolio is strong. When we get it right and when the consumer is willing to engage, I think we show strong progress on baby care even in adverse market conditions. Jon mentioned the progress we see on hair care, on Head & Shoulders and on Pantene. I think the parts of the portfolio where we had our doubts, we made the right choices, so we divested Vidal Sassoon and believe that was the right change in hair care. We have trimmed the fabric care portfolio to ensure that we can focus on the part of the market where we can create value for the consumer and for the company, so I feel good about the product portfolio. The challenge, I think in China, if I may, part of that is the channel shift. Because our footprint was disproportionately developed over 30 years to be a brick and mortar footprint and the digital acceleration obviously with COVID has shifted that into online to a large degree faster than anywhere else in the world, and within that online business, particularly to Douyin, heavily [indiscernible] led and heavily promotion led, and we\u2019re taking our time to transition our portfolio to ensure we end up with the right balance between serving consumers in brick and mortar and creating value there, and supporting our brands with the right messaging, equity, price stability and innovation in the online channels. That for me--that is the transition we\u2019re still in, but I think that transition is going well and it will show that that portfolio that we operate, I think can sustain mid single growth and value creation in China. Operator : The next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Kaumil Gajrawala : Hey everybody, good morning. I know as we get deep into the call, it gets quite granular, but if we could bring it back a little bit on something I think might have been missed as we chat global versus domestic, which is maybe just thinking about North America specifically and the first half specifically. What is the direction of travel that you\u2019re assuming for the consumer, and when we think about annualization of pricing and such, should we be modeling a drag for North America in the first half that then reverses, or is it meant to be closer to that balance for the full year of 50/50? Andre Schulten : Kaumil, it\u2019s very hard to predict, obviously, by quarter or H1 versus H2. I think you\u2019re in-going hunch is what I would share, as I think the price mix neutralization will continue through H1, and the volume component, I think is relatively stable. As I said, the market is continuing to grow at 2%, price mix has come down to about a point and a half, and I think that\u2019s what I would expect from a market growth perspective for the front half. Our objective is, as always, to be within that range, so that\u2019s my view; but again, that volatility can be driven by different innovation cycles, it can be driven by different promotion cycles, by channel shifts, so there is a lot of variability within that, but purely extrapolating from what we see in the market today, I think your hunch is right. Operator : Our last question comes from Robert Moskow of TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Robert Moskow : Hi, thanks for the question. I guess the only thing not covered on this call is the Olympics. I think I\u2019ve seen about 100 ads for Procter & Gamble products, some of them great, but I haven\u2019t noticed an increase in merchandising activity in our Nielsen tracking data in the U.S. around it. I was just wondering, do you view the Olympic sponsorship more as a brand building exercise for consumers, or have you been getting and do you expect to get a lot of merchandising activity around it in the U.S. that we\u2019ll be able to see in our tracking? Thanks. Jon Moeller : We definitely view support of the Olympics as a brand building opportunity, as a consumer outreach opportunity, and frankly as a customer outreach opportunity. Where you\u2019ll see the activation in store is typically closer to the region of the event, so I wouldn\u2019t expect it to have large activation in North America. I\u2019m headed to Paris overnight tonight, I do expect to see significant activation in Europe. I\u2019ll be meeting with many of our retail partner CEOs at the Games, we host them there and spend up to a couple days together building plans going forward, which would include both during event and post event activation of the assets that we\u2019ve put in place for the Olympics. Just like our earlier discussion on return, this is something that we look at annually, but thus far it\u2019s proving to be an attractive vehicle when we focus the messaging on brands and not so much when we focus the messaging on company, simply because nobody buys P&G, they buy Tide and Ariel and Pampers, Pantene and Head & Shoulders, etc. So all good, and I\u2019m looking forward to being there with our customers and our European team over the balance of the week. Jon Moeller : Before we let--not let, before we officially end the call, I just wanted to provide again some longer term perspectives, and I\u2019m free to--I\u2019m happy to discuss it at any point during the balance of the day. We have been through--the collective we, including you, have been through incredible challenges the last number of years, whether that\u2019s COVID, whether that\u2019s inflation, whether that\u2019s war, political divisiveness, regulation - you name it. One of the things that I think is important to reflect on, the quarter\u2019s important and we reflected a lot on that today, which is appropriate, but it\u2019s also important to step back and say, how is this strategy working, not just for the quarter but for longer periods of time, as I mentioned in my remarks, pre-COVID, during COVID, post COVID, inflation, pricing, and then the big geopolitical struggles that we\u2019re all engaged in currently. Over that six-year period, the team has added $17 billion in sales, which puts us at the 88th percentile of the S&P 500, and at the same time they\u2019ve added $5 billion in profit, which puts us at the 93rd percentile of the S&P 500. They\u2019ve built more than 200--I haven\u2019t looked today, but before today, $200 billion in market cap in that six-year period, which is more value than most of our competitors, I think all but one, have created over their entire history as a company, so this is something that is working extraordinarily well. I think that\u2019s important to reflect on as we move forward. We\u2019re in a stronger place in terms of executing against that strategy than we\u2019ve ever been. We\u2019ve talked about investment in innovation, we\u2019ve talked about raising the bar on superiority, we\u2019ve talked about the progress that we\u2019re making on productivity. We\u2019ve talked about the support levels that our business has, we\u2019ve talked about resuming volume growth in most of the major markets and doing that while building margin and simultaneously increasing our investment in these kinds of things, and I don\u2019t see any reason in a--if we do find ourselves in a more difficult environment from a consumer economic standpoint, one of the things we talk about internally is would we change our approach if we either had confidence that things were going to get remarkably better from a consumer standpoint or remarkably worse from a consumer standpoint, would we not want to be in daily use categories where performance drives brand choice? I think that\u2019s exactly where we\u2019d want to be in either of those scenarios. Would we not want to be able to delight consumers and customers with superior products? I can\u2019t imagine how that would be a good idea. Would we not want to have the productivity that enables us to fund those investments and accelerate innovation? Would we not want to have a more agile accountable organization structure? All these things to me, under any scenario, both because of the results that they deliver and because of the potential they hold to delight consumers, customers, employees, society and share owners, are the right path forward, which is why we talk about continuing to double down. I have said many times, this will not be a straight line. There are all sorts of things that affect the trend line in the business, but over periods of time, this is by far--if we just look at our history as a company, it has produced significantly positive results, and I expect that to continue. I just wanted to share that as we close out the call. Again, that is not trying to minimize some of the challenges that we\u2019ve been discussing on the quarter and on the first half of next year. Those are real, they\u2019re important to talk about, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019re controlling as we think about the mid and longer term. Have a great day, and look forward to catching up with you soon. Andre Schulten : Thanks everyone. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

Joining me on the call today is John Chevalier, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Execution of our integrated strategy delivered another quarter of solid earnings and cash results. These results enable us to maintain our guidance ranges for fiscal year '25. Organic sales grew 2% comparing against a strong base period of 7% growth. Volume contributed 1 point to organic sales growth, pricing added 1 point and mix was roughly in line with prior year. Eight of 10 product categories grew or held organic sales for the quarter. Family care, home care and personal healthcare each grew mid-single digits. Hair care, oral care, feminine care, fabric care and grooming grew low singles. Baby care and skin and personal care were down mid-singles. Organic sales in focus markets grew 2% and enterprise markets were up 1%. Organic sales in North America grew 4%, driven by 4 points of volume growth. Over the last five quarters, North America has grown organic sales 7%, 5%, 3%, 4% and now again 4% on volume growth between 3% and 4% each of those quarters. The region delivered broad-based market share growth this quarter with eight of 10 categories holding or growing volume share and nine of 10 categories holding or growing value share. Europe focus markets organic sales were up 3%. This compares against 15% organic sales growth in the base period and includes a 2-point headwind from lower inventory versus the base period. Volume was up 4 points, despite the base period inventory impacts. Over the last five quarters, Europe focus markets have grown organic sales an average of nearly 7% on volume growth of 3%. Latin America organic sales were up low single digits against a strong 19% base period comp. Brazil grew mid-singles and Mexico was in line with prior year, each of these markets comparing against strong 14% growth in the base period. European enterprise markets grew mid-singles, driven by pricing to offset inflation and currency devaluation impacts in addition to modest volume growth. Greater China organic sales declined 15%. Underlying market conditions weakened further during the quarter and we continue to face brand-specific headwinds on SK-II. We will begin to annualize some of the steep market declines and SK-II headwinds late in December, though it will likely be a few more quarters until we return to growth in China. Market conditions in the Asia-Pacific, Middle-East, Africa region have remained soft with organic sales down low singles. Global aggregate value share grew 10 basis points with 28 of our Top 50 category country combinations holding or growing share for the quarter. On the bottom line, core earnings per share were $1.93, up 5% versus prior year. On a currency-neutral basis, core EPS increased 4%. Core gross margin was in line with prior year and core operating margin increased 30 basis points, strong productivity improvement of 230 basis points. Currency-neutral core operating margin decreased 10 basis points. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 82%, consistent with our expectations. We returned nearly $4.4 billion of cash to shareowners this quarter, over $2.4 billion in dividends and over $1.9 billion in share repurchases. To summarize results, solid top line growth across roughly 85% of the business, keeping us on track for the fiscal year. Continued volume and value share gains in North America and improving share trends in Europe focus markets. Earnings and cash results in line with our expectations, also on-track with fiscal year guidance. Overall, good performance in what continues to be a challenging economic and geopolitical environment. We will continue to push all levers in our control to offset the headwinds that are largely not in our control. We remain committed to the integrated strategy that has enabled strong results over the past six years and that is the foundation for balanced growth and value creation. We've made portfolio choices across markets and brands to strengthen our ability to generate US dollar-based returns. We are doubling-down on superiority across all five vectors and we are improving productivity in all areas of the operation to fuel investments in superiority, mitigate cost and currency headwinds and drive margin expansion. We are driving constructive disruption of ourselves and our industry, a willingness to change, adapt and create new trends, technologies and capabilities that will shape the future of our industry and extend our competitive advantage. We are benefiting from an organization that is empowered, agile and accountable. Our strategic choices on portfolio, superiority, productivity, constructive disruption and organization reinforce and build on each other and we remain confident in our strategy and in our ability to drive market growth and to deliver balanced growth and value creation. We will elaborate on the integrated strategy and how it's driving competitive advantage and results at our Investor Day in November. Now, moving to guidance for fiscal 2025. With one quarter complete, our guidance ranges for fiscal '25 remain unchanged and we are -- and they are consistent with our long-term algorithm. We continue to expect the environment around us to remain volatile and challenging from input costs to currencies to consumer, competitor, retailer and geopolitical dynamics. On the top line, we are maintaining our organic sales growth guidance in the range of 3% to 5%. We continue to expect the markets in which we compete to deliver local currency sales growth in the range of 3% to 4% for the year and our objective remains to grow organic sales modestly ahead of the underlying growth of these markets. As a reminder, when you're modeling all-in sales, please remember to include the impact of divestitures from last fiscal year. This was an 80 basis point drag in quarter one and will also impact the balance of the fiscal year. On the bottom line, our core EPS guidance range for fiscal '25 remains at plus 5% to 7% versus fiscal '24 of a core EPS base of $6.59. This guidance equates to a range of $6.91 to $7.05 per share. Our outlook for commodity costs and foreign exchange have each improved modestly since our initial guidance for the year. We are now guiding for a commodity cost headwind of approximately $200 million after tax, which equates to a headwind of $0.08 per share for fiscal '25. We are forecasting foreign exchange to be in line with prior year. We continue to expect lower non-operating income benefits this fiscal year and a somewhat higher tax rate versus prior year. Combined, these are additional $0.10 to $0.12 headwind to core EPS. We expect adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% for the year. We have plans to pay around $10 billion in dividends and to repurchase $6 billion to $7 billion in common stock, combined, returning $16 billion to $7 billion of cash to shareowners this fiscal year. This outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates, significant additional currency weakness, commodity cost increases, geopolitical disruptions, major supply chain disruptions or store closures are not anticipated within these guidance ranges. To conclude, the earnings and cash results in the quarter keep us on track with our fiscal year guidance ranges, and we are doubling down on all levers to accelerate growth in the coming quarters. We continue to believe the best path forward is excellent execution of our market constructive strategy with a focus on balanced top and bottom-line growth and value creation, starting with a commitment to deliver irresistibly superior propositions to consumers and retail partners. Coupled with a strong productivity plan, the earnings power and value-creation potential of the company, we believe are as strong as ever. Finally, as I mentioned, we are hosting our 2024 Investor Day here in Cincinnati on November 21, and we hope you can join us in-person or online. With that, we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Steve Powers : Thanks, and good morning, Andre. How are you? I guess to start, I think as we reflect on the quarter and really the last 12 months, I think it's fair to say you've been kind of continually surprised to the downside on the trajectory of growth. And obviously, markets like China and the Middle East have caused persistent challenges. The good news as you suggested is that we're going to start to lap those challenges. But rates of improvement are questionable, as you highlighted. And I think investors are somewhat fearful of that alongside of that the benefit of cycling the challenges, you'll start to have some more deceleration in markets where we had strength, US and Europe focus markets probably most pertinent. I guess, how do you assess those challenges? You called out the consistent outlook of market growth of 3% to 4% that's relatively bullish on the dynamics I'm referencing. So what do you say to investors who are more concerned about deceleration from here in that underlying growth? Andre Schulten : Good morning, Steve. Hope you're well. Yeah, let's maybe start with the years before we get into the acceleration on the quarters. If you step back, we did deliver last year on guidance or above guidance for each of the metrics that we had outlined in our guidance, organic sales, core EPS, free cash flow, cash to shareowners. And as we had telegraphed in December, we saw these headwinds early on, China, SK-II, Nigeria, Argentina, the Middle East. And despite those headwinds decelerating quarter three and quarter four top line performance, we said we would deliver within guidance range, which we did. We also were clear that these headwinds would be with us through the front half of this fiscal year. So a slower top line growth versus expected average for the fiscal year in the front half is not a surprise. It's actually what we expected within the guidance range. And that's, I think, the part of the guidance that was clear to us, as you rightly point out, I think the level of deceleration in the Middle East and in China, I think, is still volatile. More importantly, if you look at the rest of the portfolio, if you look at US, Canada, Europe focus markets, Europe enterprise markets, Latin America, those regions constitute 85% of our sales base. And these regions in aggregate are growing 4% in quarter one on a 10% base on quarter one last year. North America sales over the past five quarters were consistently up 7%, 5%, 3%, 4%, 4%. Europe is growing on a 7% average over the past five quarters, 3% of that from a volume growth standpoint. We are growing or holding volume share in all of these regions in aggregate. So I think the core of the business, 85% is as strong as we could wish for. It's growing 4% and it's been growing at that pace significantly with very high base period comps. The last thing I'll leave you with on the 85% of the business that is not impacted by any external factors, we have probably the strongest innovation out there in the second half that we've seen in a long time. So a combination of very strong structures in each of these markets, very strong innovation in the second half and easing comps in the base give us confidence that we can see a sustained growth and also some level of acceleration in the core of the business. The volatility, as you pointed out, is entirely introduced by China and by the situation in the Middle East. And the way we think about the guidance is if we annualize and when we annualize these base effects in quarter two and quarter three, we will get to the midpoint of guidance. If we see more than annualization and some level of improvement in the situation, that could get us to the top-end of the guidance. When we see the situation continuing to decelerate, that would point to the lower-end of the guidance. That's the very simple logic. What you will find in all of this is a strong belief that the core 85% will continue to grow in line with what we've seen and grow stronger with innovation in the back half. Operator : Our next question will come from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Please go ahead. Lauren Lieberman : Great. Thanks so much. So, just a follow-on on Steve's thought process there, Andre, your response. And we've heard more, early days in earnings season, but there are a number of multinational companies that are calling out worsening trends. So, European consumer was particularly called out yesterday by Nestle, Latin America a bit less good. And then of course, China, I have to assume that, that down 15% was a surprise to you guys this quarter. So, just what about the, I guess, risk factor around your point on that 85% because it doesn't feel like it leaves a lot of room for any kind of slowing in the macro environment, which just feels a little bit contrary to what we're hearing from some other consumer companies. Thanks. Andre Schulten : Good morning, Lauren. Yeah, the -- I mean, when we talk about our consumer, we talk about the consumer in our categories. And we've chosen these categories for a reason. They are daily-use. Consumers don't stop washing their hair, they don't stop doing their laundry. And they are categories where the product performance is very important to consumers because they understand that the cost of failure is actually higher than maybe the premium they would pay for a product that promises to perform in line with what their expectations are. And that logic, I think, leads to the consumer continuing to trade into P&G and continuing to trade up. And you see that in terms of share growth in the US, we consistently have grown share, both volume share and value share. We have consistently been able to trade consumers up within our portfolio and we're bringing more innovation focused on stronger performance and increasing superiority across the different categories and brands. The same holds true for Europe. When you look at the growth rate in Europe in the last quarter, it was actually 5% excluding the inventory effect year-over-year and we are seeing stabilizing to growing volume share trends in Europe, again, with very strong innovation in the back half. Latin America is stabilizing. We've articulated that we're growing the biggest two markets, Brazil and Mexico on a 14% base, and we expect within our construct that the Latin American market growth will return to mid-single digits, 5% to 6%, which is what we're seeing materialize. So every indication that we have in terms of data and in terms of the plans that the teams are executing now and into the second half give us confidence that we can continue the momentum at the run-rate level, which means with easing comps, it would mean an acceleration on a year-over-year comparison. Everything can change. There's no guarantee. But with everything that we can see, we feel confident that that component of 85% of the sales is holding or strengthening as we go through the year. You are right, China and the Middle-East are the least predictable components. That's why they introduced the volatility in the guidance range at this point in time. Look, we are -- the best way to increase the probability that we see an improvement is to focus on the fundamentals, which we are doing. In China, we have cleared the portfolio to focus the organization on those brands. We have the strongest growth potential. We are reinventing our go-to-market model with our distributor partners to increase coverage and quality of coverage. We have strong innovation across the portfolio, which is showing signs of revitalizing the categories. When you look at the Head & Shoulders and Pantene innovation, the baby care portfolio continues to perform strongly. And SK-II is making progress with the launch of the super-premium proposition and beginning national marketing support again. So we're pointing in the right direction. The macro context is questionable and we will have to see where this goes. The same is true for the Middle-East, but that's why we have the range within the guidance. So overall, I think we're confident. You're right to point out there's a level of volatility here, which we hope we have adequately communicated. Operator : Our next question will come from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Dara Mohsenian : Hey, good morning. Andre Schulten : Hey, Dara. Dara Mohsenian : So, just to follow-up on this 85% of sales mix versus 15% dynamic. First, maybe on the 85%, obviously, the US is the lion's share of that. Can you just touch on what you think sustained category growth is here in the US in a moderate pricing environment from an industry perspective as you look out over the next couple of years here and I guess you sound pretty confident in the market share momentum in the US, but maybe you can touch on that in a bit more detail. And then just on the laggard 15%, it's helpful the detail you gave us in terms of what a sequential improvement could mean or not mean going forward to corporate OSG. Just give us a little more sense of your perspective, the comps are much easier, is the base case that there should be an inflection in that 15% going-forward? With easier comps I understand some of the volatility you mentioned, but just trying to get a sense of how you see that developing on the 15% of mix as you look out over the next few quarters here. Thanks. Andre Schulten : Thank you, Dara. Let me start with the US and then maybe go a little bit broader, but the opportunity we see in the US is still huge. When you look at the categories in which we operate, we see sustained market growth in the range of 3% to 4% at this point. It's decelerating as we had expected from the 5%, 6% range we saw in previous years as the pricing component comes down, but it's encouraging that the volume side is actually coming up strongly and is sustaining strong growth. So we expect the 3% to 4% range is where the market is going to be. But as you know, our job within that the way we view it is to continue to drive our categories and continue to drive market growth beyond that 3% to 4%, so we can grow ahead and we grow share. The opportunity is in multiple dimensions. Number one, just looking at consumers that we don't serve yet at the full level at which we serve other consumer groups is about a $5 billion growth opportunity, and we're focusing on that by being more intentional about the benefits that these specific consumer groups are looking for, the way those benefits need to be addressed in a product solution, the way they need to be communicated to register with the consumer group and where we need to be distributed in order to reach those consumers. Innovation in that space, both across product package, across communication and across go-to-market, we believe is a big driver of capturing that $5 billion growth opportunity. We have many categories that across the consumer base are still showing significant penetration opportunities. We frequently talk about fabric enhancers. It's more than $1 billion business, but household penetration is only about 30% on liquid fabric enhancers, only about 20% on beads. So there's a huge growth opportunity to drive more household penetration by, again, finding ways to make this proposition more appealing to more consumers. Power oral care, big example of underpenetrated category, a new claim of we're having on our power oral care IO business with 100% more plaque bacteria removal. That business is growing 8% and the global share is up 2%. So there are many examples where we see growth opportunity in the US. The same is true for Europe. And maybe for perspective, there are some markets in Europe that drag the performance down. France, for example, had a change in terms of legislation on how promotions can be executed in March of last year -- in March of this year, but last fiscal year. And that has significantly impacted our performance in France along with everybody else. So, France is down 11%. Normalizing that will give us on top of the same opportunity I described for the US will lead to a level of acceleration that we expect. On the 15% of the business, again, our base assumption is that we simply annualize most of these effects. We see stabilization across categories. There are quarter-to-quarter effects in China that need to be taken into account with shifts in key consumption periods. But I think the general assumption is that we will over the next couple of quarters start to annualize both SK-II and the major China market contraction and that will help towards the stabilization of the total. The same is true for the Middle East. Most important point I still want to make is we're not just sitting there and waiting for the business to annualize. We're fundamentally improving every aspect of how we operate the business from innovation to go-to-market to media both in the Middle-East and in China. Operator : Our next question will come from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Bryan Spillane : Hey, thanks, operator. Good morning, Andre. Good morning, John. My question is just around the gross margins and the cost of goods sold inflation. And this morning, the inflation came moderated a bit. So I guess two questions. One, was any of that moderation of inflation present in the quarter, so did it affect at all gross margins in this quarter? And then as we're thinking about it going forward, as we\u2019re thinking about our models, is there anything that would offset it actually improving gross margins a little bit more? So whether it's segment mix or geographic mix, just how should we think about how that improvement sort of nets out in our model? Andre Schulten : Yeah. Good morning, Bryan. Look, I think the main driver of our gross margin progress will continue to be productivity. You see 170 basis points contribution to gross margin in the current quarter. And I expect that level of productivity contribution to remain or accelerate as we get to our target of $1.5 billion of COGS [gross] (ph) savings throughout the year. We continue to have an effect from SK-II and SK-II is down 35% in the quarter. So it's a significant impact when you think about the gross margin that business contributes. So the other driver here is as we see annualization of the SK-II effects that will help gross margin going forward. To the inflation question, there is some level reflected of easing inflation. The majority of that, I think, will spread throughout the year. Again, our P&L variance holding policy plus contracts generally make for a six to nine months delay from actual commodity inflation to it flowing through our P&L. So that will be a help, I would probably model towards the latter half of the fiscal year. Operator : Our next question will come from Chris Carey of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Chris Carey : Hi, good morning, Andre. I wanted to ask about -- specific questions about the baby business and also the family care business. This is a few quarters in a row that baby is under pressure. Can you just talk about the durability of this pressure, maybe how much of that has to do with geographic splits between China and the US and what really the path is to see improvement from here even if the birth rate dynamic is not in your favor? And secondly, on the family care business, I think this is something like, I don't know, 11 consecutive quarters of growth, but pricing will become less of a tailwind. I don't think there was any real pricing in the quarter. Can you just talk about the sustainability of these growth rates in the family care business? And also, if you could, just maybe touch on whether you saw any benefit in this quarter from stock-up activity with some of the port congestion and storms and whether we should be thinking about that maybe next quarter or just in general, if that's something that we should be considering as we think about the next quarter or two going forward in that business. So, thanks, on baby and family care. Andre Schulten : Great. Thank you, Chris. Let me start with family care, maybe. The business model in family care is very stable and sustainable. And the main driver here is to contribute to category growth. That's really the job of the business. And the way to do that is to drive innovation. The innovation is generally an improvement in the substrate, so an improvement of the Bounty substrate or the Charmin substrate, which leads to the ability to then down-count sheets of the roll, increase the roll diameter or the roll size. So consumers have actually more products available to them and that is a ever-repeating cycle of innovation driving category growth. That cycle has been working for decades. I expect it to continue to work the same way. The innovation capability of the technology in family care, which is unique to P&G, is by far not exhausted. And so we have runway in terms of the innovation we can drive. And again, the model has proven to be very sustainable over decades through different economic contexts. On the stock-up situation, we saw a quick run-up with a port strike, but it didn't really have a material impact on this quarter, nor are we expecting any impact on last quarter. It was very short-lived. So therefore, again, no impact, current, no impact next quarter. Baby care has been subject to decelerating or decreasing birth rates forever. That is not a new dynamic. It's a dynamic that has existed within the baby care category for a long, long time, as long as I've been associated with it, which is a long, long time. The way to create value and growth in baby care is not volume growth. It is really to provide superior propositions for consumers and thereby trade them up into higher order benefit spaces and create value from a market perspective and from a share perspective that way. When we do that successfully, even in the most challenging environments, we can grow. A case in point would be China. China has the fastest deceleration in birth rates, but with a very strong portfolio that is innovating across all tiers, we have been able to consistently grow sales and share in China. So when the business is innovating in line with what consumers are looking for, communicating that innovation in the right way, distributed in the right way, the model works very well. Where we don't, the model stutters, and that sputters. And that's a little bit the situation in North America. We've talked about this before. We have very strong innovation on the premium tier swaddlers and cruise 360. We continue to see share growth, swaddlers is up I think, 1.6 share points, Cruise 360 is up 50 basis points or 60 basis points. So that part of the portfolio is doing very well. We have an opportunity to innovate on the mid-tier. We just launched [Lowe\u2019s Platinum Care] (ph). It's too early to tell, but I think it's encouraging to see it in market and we are working on strong innovation on the baby dry business, and that's the same opportunity that we have in Europe. So the model works, but it requires discipline around strong innovation and that's what the business is working on. Now that we have full access to lines because we don't have any capacity shortfalls, I fully expect the business to go back to growth here over the next few quarters. Operator : Our next question will come from Filippo Falorni of Citi. Please go ahead. Filippo Falorni : Hey, good morning, everyone. So, Andre, I wanted to go back to China and your comments about still being a few quarters until you return to growth. Look, you're starting to annualize some of the impacts for SK-II already in the next quarter. So, should we think about the pace of improvement in China in the sense of less declines, but still negative growth in the balance of the year? And how does the recent stimulus measure in China inform kind of your gradual improvement in the country? And then if I can ask one more on the total company level, I think it would be helpful to give a little bit of context how you see the progression in terms of organic sales growth from approximately 2% in Q1. Should we expect a sequential improvement in Q2 or is it really the improvement to get to your midpoint of your guidance more skewed to the second half? Thank you. Andre Schulten : Yeah. Thanks, Filippo. Good morning. Predicting recovery pace in China is a futile task, I think. So we won't attempt that. That's why we have the range that we have communicated. I would expect sequential improvement simply because of the mass of annualization. So we expect any deceleration to not offset the base effect. But that's where it ends. Again, as we've communicated, if China is simply annualizing, that would point to the mid end -- midpoint of the guidance. If it does anything better than that, that would help us towards the upper-end. If it continues to decelerate throughout the year, that would point us to the lower-end of the guidance range. I won't make any prediction what the pace or the direction by quarter is. On the progressions per quarter, look, we don't give you quarterly forecast for a reason. We need some level of flexibility to manage across quarters. But I think logically, we have to expect some level of progression going into quarter two, but it will be the overarching effect that I still want to call-out is the headwinds are still with us in quarter one and in quarter two. Operator : The next question will come from Robert Ottenstein of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Robert Ottenstein : Great. Well, you guys have done a fantastic job, obviously in the US and Europe. So I want to circle back to China on a more bigger picture basis. By my estimates, it looks like your sales are now down 20% to 25% over three years. So three years of consecutive declines. And so the question is, are there structural changes in the Chinese market or the Chinese consumer that need to be addressed and what you're doing to do to address those changes? And I think you also mentioned in terms of SK-II that you're starting to push that brand a little bit more now. So are there -- are you starting to see some green-shoots with the consumer and the appreciation of that brand and the ability to get that going? Again, thank you. Andre Schulten : Good morning, Robert. Thank you. There are many changes to the Chinese consumer that need to be taken into account, and that's the work the team is doing that I was mentioning before, where consumers buy. Again, online is a significant part of the business and even within the online spectrum, a shift into Douyin is a significant part of what needs to be taken into account where the communication model, the way to build brand equity and the way to communicate value is different than in any other digital channel. A shift in the brick-and-mortar business towards club, towards grocers and supers is another area that needs to be taken into account. So we are, as I mentioned earlier, we are rebuilding our distributor partnerships to ensure that we can reach consumers in the right places with the right prices, with the right on-shelf availability across all propositions. The consumer behavior in terms of benefits to go for are shifting. If you look at the mass skin care space, for example, the benefits base that was very popular over the last few years was toning. Now it's going into anti-aging and multi-benefit. So we're adjusting our innovation portfolio to meet those requirements. The way media is consumed is changing. So we need to adjust the way that we innovate in our media space and our technical capability to reach consumers without duplication at the right frequency. So all of those things are changing, Robert. And we are -- I think we're doing a good job. The team is doing a great job in adjusting to those realities. But as you say, as long as the market is not recovering, it will still be an uphill climb. But I do believe that we are very well positioned in China to continue to win and we are on a relative basis performing well, but again in line with the market. On SK-II, I would say it's too early to say green shoots, but the brown shoots are disappearing. Let me let me put it that way. We have done all the right work in terms of rebuilding the brand equity, focusing on the right campaign messaging, activating the most loyal users to be advocates for the brand, innovating, as I said, on the core and on the super-premium, upgrading our department store presence, investing in beauty counselors. And so the early signs are positive. But again, I think I want to give ourselves a little bit of time here before we declare green shoots. Operator : Our next question will come from Kevin Grundy of BNP Paribas. Please go ahead. Kevin Grundy : Great. Thanks. Good morning, Andre. I wanted to pivot. So with respect to areas that you can control, I wanted to ask about market share performance. And if I'm not mistaken, I think the comment was earlier in the call, you're gaining or holding share in 28 of your top 50 markets, so a bit more than half. Also, if I'm not mistaken, that's down from 75% in fiscal '22, I believe the company's longer-term target is closer to 65%. And this is also within the context, you reiterated the 3% to 4% sort of global category growth and the company 22% organic sales in the quarter, understanding some of the dynamics here in the base and 15% of the business seeing more acute headwinds. So with all of that in sort of context, I was hoping you could comment on sort of longer term the importance of market shares at KPI within the organization. And then two, and I think maybe more immediately, what you see is the greatest areas of opportunity to elevate the company's market share performance. Thank you for that. Andre Schulten : Good morning, Kevin. Yeah. Look, the market share trend, I think, is generally positive. It wasn't necessarily a surprise that the market-share would decrease in terms of number of category country combinations that are growing or holding share simply because of the level of pricing that we have to take and some of the dynamics where, for example, retailer brand pricing in Europe significantly lagged in terms of timing. So going ahead and leading in many of those markets because we simply are the category leader generally results in short-term share effects that are less favorable and I think that's to a large degree the deceleration in terms of number of category country combinations that you see growing. I would say the way we talk to our teams about it is what our job is to grow markets. And the best way to grow markets is to increase household penetration of our categories. The earliest indication to see whether we're increasing household penetration is volume share. So it is an important measure for us. If it is a measure of creating incremental consumption and that's what we ultimately bring it back to. So it's an early indication for us to say, okay, if we don't grow volume share, we're probably not growing household penetration. But the real measure that we're going after is panel-based household penetration, which is the best measure of how we doing our job in growing markets. I think we're making progress here. The European results are, as I mentioned, both in focus markets and enterprise markets, we are holding to growing volume share now, which was very important to see. That's where the private-label pricing effect was most pronounced. That's a significant portion of our top-50 category country combinations. Most pleased about the progress in the US where we continue to grow both volume share and value share. And I also think the plans in Latin America are very strong in terms of innovation. So I have confidence that the share progression there will be positive. Operator : Our next question will come from Peter Grom of UBS. Please go ahead. Peter Grom : Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. I guess, Andre, I wanted to ask a follow-up to Steve and Filippo's question and I don't want to be too specific. But when you're kind of discussing the rate of improvement or annualizing the impacts from China and the Middle-East and kind of the organic revenue range, are you speaking to where it would put organic revenue growth for the year or are you kind of just speaking conceptually how you would see it evolving for the balance of the year? And I guess the reason I ask is it seems that in order to hit the midpoint of the range, you would need some pretty strong performance from here after the 2% in 1Q. So I just wasn't sure if you were implying that based on where things stand today, simply annualizing these headwinds would still be enough to hit 4% for the year? Thanks. Andre Schulten : Yeah, I think it would be a combination, Peter, of annualizing the headwinds and maintaining and slightly accelerating the run rate in the 85% of the business, which on an easier comp would then increase obviously the year-over-year quarterly growth. It's hard to say how these two pieces exactly will work together, but conceptually, we know two things need to be true. One, we need to annualize and we need to annualize at the end of quarter two and quarter three. Number two, the 85% of the business needs to keep running at the pace that it's running at. Operator : Our next question today will come from Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Andrea Teixeira : Thank you, operator, and good morning to all. Andre, can you comment a little bit on what Peter was trying to get to? And I think is valid in the sense that your skin care performance, right, it was like I believe more than 20% negative in total. And then you're annualizing and if I'm doing the math correctly, that on itself is 700 basis points to 800 basis point sequential easiness in guide now in comp. So, would that to say, that needs to be slightly better. So let's say the minus 22%, call it becoming mid-teens negative on itself helps your comp. And then on top of that, you're saying kind of stability. But in terms of stability, what gives you confidence that Europe and the US can keep that stability or even Latin America can keep that 85% running all things that we know now for the second quarter. So it implies, I mean, I'm all to say that it does imply if you're keeping guidance at the midpoint, it does imply that you're going to be sequentially better in the second quarter of fiscal. Is that the way we should be thinking? Andre Schulten : Andrea, look, I think the -- I want to be clear, the guidance is a range. So it's 3% to 5% on the topline and all the scenarios you're describing can either lead to 5% or can lead to 3%. I think what we're saying is the range is still viable. Yes, if you want to get to 5%, you have to see a significant acceleration in or you have to see a fast annualization and some acceleration in China and the Middle-East and you have to see sequential stability on the core of the business. I think I've explained the assumptions, but the range is still viable. What gives me confidence on the 85% of the business is what I've said before, that business has been delivering at these growth rates not for one quarter, but for five quarters, in some cases for six quarters. So if you look at that, I think it gives me confidence that we have a sustained track-record of delivering at those growth rates. And when you look at the share trajectory, it's pointing upwards and we have more innovation coming. So I think the fuel is there, but you're right, there are multiple scenarios where you can construct this, where you end up at a 3%. There are multiple scenarios where you can construct this where you end up at 5%. Operator : Next question today will come from Kaumil Gajrawala of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Kaumil Gajrawala : Hi, thank you. Good morning, everyone. Can you talk a bit about price points and promo? And in particular, I guess, I see that mix was negative for both beauty and grooming. Beauty, I guess, I would assume is SK-II, but maybe just talking about where the consumer is, are you seeing trading down? How you're thinking about that in the context of promotional activity in absolute price points? And then very quickly, anything on inventory destocking? We're just hearing more and more of that at retailers. Curious if that's something that's impacting you or something that you're watching? Andre Schulten : Yeah. Hey, Kaumil. On promo, I would describe the overall market situation as stable, little change versus what we've talked in the previous quarters. both in Europe and in the US. We again, we focus on promotion that hopefully drives market growth and category growth in lower penetrated categories, combining with high penetration categories, so we can provide value to consumers, but at the same time drive growth and trial. Overall competitive environment is still stable and still slightly below pre-COVID levels. You're right, the beauty, negative mix -- price/mix effect is driven by SK-II. And on grooming, it's really driven by a shift. We had a record appliance period a year ago. Now we have more sales in the in the Gillette part of the portfolio. So that's the shift that you see in grooming. Nothing points to the consumer trading down. Nothing points to any increased price-based competition at this point in time. And again, I'm repeating myself, but the categories we're in, we have the right propositions that reassure consumers that the products work. We have the right price ladders, so there's access to consumers at higher cash outlays, lower cash outlays, higher price per unit, lower price per unit. And as long as we keep innovating and driving that irresistible superiority, I believe we will be fine. But we keep watching this very closely at this point in time, no indications that the consumer is not with us. Private label shares are flat. And if you look at a sequential basis, private label value share in the US is actually down from past 12 months, 16.2% to now 15.7%. So, all of that indicates to me a stable consumer and stable price promotion environment. Operator : Our next question will come from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Please go ahead. Mark Astrachan : Yeah, thanks. Good morning, everybody. I wanted to ask specifically on SK-II. It seems like the trends in the brand are just a little bit worse than the overall prestige skin care category. I guess I'm curious about how you think about the brand. I think you've talked before, maybe not last quarter or quarter before that about work that you had done about brand relevant and awareness and intent to purchase improving and clearly it's not, I guess some of that's the weaker consumer in China, but at some point, does it become a question of brand impairment and kind of need to reinvest and reinvent the brand to broaden or be relevant. So I guess the question is, how do you think about all of what I just said in the context of just the underperformance versus the category seems to be widening and kind of what's a reasonable rate of a timeframe for it to return to some sort of improving trend, not even growth. I know what you said about China, but SK-II specifically within that market would be helpful. Thank you. Andre Schulten : Yeah. Thank you, Mark. SK-II as a brand continues to be very relevant. The core benefit and the core ingredient is the reason to believe that benefit is delivered plus the efficacy shown in actual consumer experience over decades, I think is still the most relevant proposition and as close to irresistible superiority that is actually ingredient driven in the category as you can find. And the consumer is playing that back. We had very strong results in SK-II outside of China and outside of travel retail. And I think the effects that we're seeing, which is dragging the brand down is the unique combination of a Japanese brand in a Chinese context when there's conflict and therefore a negative sentiment towards Japanese brands in aggregate. That's unique to SK-II and I think that's what's driving the effect. When the business is down to that degree, there is a level of investment choice that needs to be made, which the team has done. But we've encouraged them to continue to invest at the right level to rebuild the equity of the brand, specifically in China and in travel retail, which I think they are doing well. So I've got not much more to add other than to say the brand is very relevant. The core of the brand is being strengthened with the core messaging of what PITERA is and what the benefit is that the brand delivers. The addition of a super-premium tier, I think, is highly relevant for those consumers. They have the spending power and they're looking for the best possible offering and price is a connotation to quality and efficacy in these categories. So, I feel very good about the core of the brand. And obviously, the Japanese-Chinese situation is unique to SK-II, which is what we're annualizing beginning quarter two. Operator : The next question will come from Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Nik Modi : Yes, thank you. Good morning, everyone. Andre, just a quick housekeeping and then a broader question. You mentioned in your prepared commentary that you're not embedding any store closures into the guide. I think that's what I heard. And just given what's going on in the drug channel, just wanted to get your perspective on have you accounted for some of the dynamics playing out in that market. So that's the housekeeping question. The broader question is just on innovation. And I think P&G is kind of anomalous in the fact that there's real disruptive innovation coming out of the company, more so than I think the broader sector. And so maybe you can just give us an update on Olay Melts and Tide evo and kind of how that initiative is progressing. And within the pipeline over the next one to three years, what other type of -- of course, you're not going to mention the specifics, but just like similar type of disruptive type innovations, is there anything else that you can kind of share with us regarding other types of initiatives that you have with Tide evo and Olay Melts? Thanks. Andre Schulten : Thank you, Nik. As the guidance says, we've not assumed any major store closures in the US. Obviously, when there's selective store closures, that's part of the normal business, so I will leave it there. On disruptive innovation, Olay Melts is doing very well. Evo test market is also doing really well at or above expectations in the test market, but again, it's a test market so early-on. We are making progress on the industrialization of evo. So the ability to produce at-scale to be able to launch at a national level and that is also progressing as planned. So I would say both based on fiber spinning technology are very promising propositions and both seem to resonate very well with consumers. And as you point out, both are highly proprietary to P&G. And the form itself has a lot of runway when you think about our product portfolio. In terms of broader disruptive technology and being able to advance our competitive moat from a innovation standpoint, we're going to spend a lot of time on that during Investor Day. So I won't go into the details here, but it will be a big part of the conversation in November. Operator : The next question is from Olivia Tong of Raymond James. Please go ahead. Olivia Tong : Great. Thanks. I want to talk about -- there's clearly a big divergence in performance across categories and realize it sounds like beauty have higher exposure to some underperforming markets. But if we look at like fabric and home care, the example you just gave, for instance, can you talk a little bit about what you're doing differently there versus your other categories? Because it feels like in fabric and home, you're innovating more, the innovation is resonating better. Why doesn't that seem to be working in some other categories, baby, for example or beauty excluding SK-II for the moment? Because it doesn't seem like competition is any lighter in these categories, if anything, it's just heavy. Thanks. Andre Schulten : Yeah, good morning, Olivia. Look, there\u2019s a reason why we have a portfolio of 10 different categories. They at times perform at different levels, but operating the global portfolio will allow us to still deliver algorithm with even some ups and downs across categories. Specifically on your question on beauty, I think it's important to look at beauty excluding China and SK-II. If you look at that picture, North America is growing 8%, Europe 6%, enterprise markets 8%. The growth in North American hair care is 9% on a 12% base, share is up 90 basis points, global APDO is growing 11%. In North America, 9%, we've grown native sales 10 times over the past five years. So I think the team is doing a tremendous job reading the consumer, developing propositions that match consumers' needs, communicating in the right way, bringing them to market and that's I think what's reflected. But it's hard to overcome with a significant part of your business in China, those headwinds. Fabric and home care is doing a tremendous job in innovation. We've talked about evo, we've talked about fabric enhancers. The runway is also huge across both categories because they both represent relatively big opportunities in terms of incremental household penetration. When you think about Swiffer, for example, PowerMop is a new product to the category and is driving significant category growth, is up 9%. Downy and Tide Rinse are new adds to the laundry regime as odor removers and they are the number one driver of category growth. So when we find those opportunities, that accelerates business market growth and is sustainable. And we have pockets of that in baby care when you think about Ninjamas, for example, which is a bedwetter category, which was very underserved. When we innovated in that category, we grew categories. We drove category growth of 6% to 7% and took significant share. And so there are opportunities in all of those categories. Will they all be at the same time and so we see consistent growth across all? No. But all these categories are rich with opportunity to drive innovation, drive category growth and delight more consumers. Operator : Our next question is from Korinne Wolfmeyer of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Korinne Wolfmeyer : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I'd like to hopefully get a little bit more color on what you're seeing with your retailer partners. How are inventory orders tracking? Has there been any change throughout the quarter and how are you expecting those orders to trend over the next several quarters? And then just generally speaking, how is that -- how are you viewing the broader retail dynamic both in the US and then in Europe and LatAm and how are those differing? Thank you. Andre Schulten : Thank you. Inventory levels at retailers, broadly speaking, are stable. There's no major movement. The only effect worth calling out was the base period effect in Europe where some retailers increased inventory levels in quarter one of last year because we had announced a supply chain program that was cutting over at that time. Other than that, I would characterize it with relative stability, nothing to report. The general retailer relationship with P&G is extremely constructive. I would describe it as probably the best retailer relationships we've had as far as I can remember, and that's true for the US, that is true for Europe where we have built strong partnerships with our retailers all under the common objective to grow markets. And the more retailers understand, embrace and see how partnership with P&G, strong innovation and ability to reach underserved or unserved consumers can help them grow their categories and our categories, that partnership is only strengthening. On the supply chain side, we are building very powerful programs to integrate our supply chains, create more value, reduce inventory levels and cash needed. Those programs are off to a very promising start. And so all of that contributes, I think, to the very positive retailer relationships that we see around the globe. Operator : The next question will come from Rob Moskow of TD Securities. Please go ahead. Rob Moskow : Hi, thanks for the question. Andre, regarding the $300 million positive benefit in terms of your outlook for commodity costs, could you tell me, like, how you think about that versus your original guide, like, do you intend to like hold it back and maybe deploy it in categories where you kind of need to compete more effectively because of price competition or can you think -- do you have more proactive plans with that money to put it into areas of growth? Like how are you thinking about that benefit? Andre Schulten : Look, we're still looking at a $200 million AT headwind for the year. So, in relative terms, it's not really healthy year-over-year, it's still a $200 million AT cost headwind that we need to absorb. And honestly, the way this works within our structure is the business units control what to do in terms to offset any headwinds or if there are tailwinds how to reinvest and if to reinvest within the business. And so there's no corporate approach to any of this. It's really based on what is best for each of the categories in each of the regions. And therefore, I can't really give you a constructive answer here other than to say it's still a $200 million after-tax headwind. We'll deal with it. It's embedded in our guidance range. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Linda Bolton Weiser of D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead. Linda Bolton Weiser : Yes, hi. I just wanted to ask a little bit more about the beauty segment. I was curious about Olay in North America and what's being done there in terms of the competition, the derm kind of base brands, the competition there. And then on China, again, we're all talking about SK-II, but how was the hair care piece in China? Was that decline less? And how is Pantene doing and what are you doing there on the hair care side in China? Thanks. Andre Schulten : Thank you, Linda. As I said, the beauty business overall in North America is doing very well. You point to the Olay business, and within Olay, the innovation on super-serums is incredibly successful. The most successful entry in the segment in recent years and 65% of consumers are incremental to the category, so exactly what we want to see. Melt is very successful, resonating with consumers and that's a new form. So us being able to, I think, communicate the benefit of the form, consumers experiencing it and repeating now is also great to see. Now, we have an opportunity on the core business, specifically on the jar business to rejuvenate the franchise and that's the work that the team is doing with urgency. So recognized an opportunity there and it's being worked. On the hair care China side, strong innovation. We've divested our Vidal Sassoon business. We're now focusing on the three brands we have, Head & Shoulders, Pantene and Rejoice. We have strong innovation launch in Head & Shoulders, premium innovation, we've launched innovation on Pantene. Both are performing very well. Pantene was the number one hair care brand online ahead of Kerastase for the first time in the last quarter. Head & Shoulders is growing share and the plan on Rejoice launching later in the year. So the team is doing great work on the hair care brands. But again, all of this is done in a context where the market is still down. So the most important element here is, as we've said all along, the market needs to annualize and stabilize. Andre Schulten : All right. Thank you. I hope you agree with us that it's a strong start to the year on the majority of the business. We continue to see the headwinds that we had telegraphed in December, but we are confident that even with those headwinds and the strength of the core of the business, we will be able to deliver within guidance range on all metrics. We will be available for more questions during the day. So feel free to reach out and thanks for spending the time with us. Have a great day. Operator : That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",
